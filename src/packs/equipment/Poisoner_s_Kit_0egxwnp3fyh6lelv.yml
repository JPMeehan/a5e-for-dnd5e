      <p>Everything necessary for carefully harvesting and processing natural
      poisons and venoms can be found in this kit. You can attempt to harvest
      poisons from areas with abundant flora by spending an hour searching and
      making a poisoner’s kit check. On a result of 1–14 you accidentally poison
      yourself and suffer the effects of a basic poison. On a result of 15–19
      you obtain a vial’s worth of basic poison. On a result of 20–24 you obtain
      a vial’s worth of advanced poison, and on a result of 25 or higher you
      obtain a vial’s worth of potent poison.</p><p>Alternatively, with 10
      minutes of work you can use a poisoner’s kit to harvest poison from the
      fresh corpse of a creature that naturally contained poisons. Make a
      poisoner’s kit check against a DC equal to the DC of the creature’s poison
      (if the creature’s poison has no saving throw, use 8 + the creature’s CR).
      On a failed check you suffer the effects of the creature’s poison, and on
      a success you harvest a vial’s worth of poison. You can use the creature’s
      poison to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 3 pieces of
      ammunition as an action. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or
      until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. Weapons or ammunition you
      coat in a creature’s poison inflict the same effects as shown in the
      creature’s statistics. Once you harvest the poison of a creature, that
      corpse cannot be harvested from again.</p>
