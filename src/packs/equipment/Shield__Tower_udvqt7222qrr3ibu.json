Unplanting a tower shield requires a bonus action.</p>\n<p>Tower shields are bulky items, and count as such even when donned.</p>\n<p>When you take a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block it and sacrifice your shield, turning the critical hit into a regular hit. Afterwards your shield is broken, or if your shield is magical it instead becomes mundane for 1 hour.</p>",
