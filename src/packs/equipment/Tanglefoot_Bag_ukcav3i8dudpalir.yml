      <blockquote><p>Unguents and adhesives fill this airtight
      sack.</p></blockquote><p>You can use an action to throw this bag at a
      target within 20 feet, treating it as a ranged weapon attack with an
      improvised weapon. On a hit, rapidly hardening sap covers the target and
      it makes a DC 13 Strength check or becomes grappled. At the start of each
      of its turns, the target repeats the check, ending the effect on itself on
      a success.</p><p>The sap can also be destroyed (AC 13, 6 hit points).</p>
