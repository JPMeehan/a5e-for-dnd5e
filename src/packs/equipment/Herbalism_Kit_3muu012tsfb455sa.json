      "value": "<p>This kit contains the tools needed to carefully harvest and process rare herbs into remedies. You can attempt to harvest rare herbs from areas with abundant flora by spending an hour searching and making an herbalism kit check. You randomly obtain one of the following medicinals on a result of 16–22: adderwort roots, dried yewclaw bark, fairy cap, ironwood acorn, pressed spiderbulb, sycamore petal poultice. On a result of 23–27 you instead obtain one rare herb, and on a result of 28 or higher you obtain 2 rare herbs. With 1 minute of preparation a rare herb can be quickly processed into a basic healing potion, 2 rare herbs can be made into an antitoxin, or 3 rare herbs can be made into a greater healing potion.</p>",
