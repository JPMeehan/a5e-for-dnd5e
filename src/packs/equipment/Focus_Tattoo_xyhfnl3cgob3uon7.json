      "value": "<p>Some spellcasters permanently mark their bodies with symbols of their deity, eldritch runes, or ritualistic symbols. You can apply a focus tattoo over the course of a long rest, after which it functions as a spellcasting focus. Focus tattoos draw on a bearerâ€™s own magics, and must be attuned like a magic item in order to function and require an attunement slot. When you cast spells with a focus tattoo in this way, you must briefly touch your focus tattoo with your free hand.</p><p><strong><em>Divine Focus:</em></strong> These foci (often called holy symbols) are representations of a deity, pantheon, or ideal. They usually depict the crest or icon of a specific god or are of symbolic importance to a particular faith. Reliquaries, censers, amulets, emblems, or tattoos are often used as spellcasting foci by clerics and heralds.</p>",
