If you also use a compass in conjunction with a map, you gain an expertise die on checks made to avoid becoming lost.</p><p>Frontier: This map depicts an area only recently explored by those that made it and the information is often incorrect or incomplete. When consulting this map, the Narrator rolls a secret d20. On a result of 5 or less, the outdated or false information wastes travel time turning around and doubling back and the party only progresses half as much distance towards their destination.</p>",
