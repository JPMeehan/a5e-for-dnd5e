Gambling can potentially earn or lose money, depending on the amount you wager and the outcome of your check. You can also attempt to cheat opponents by making a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the highest Perception check among observers, turning your opponents hostile on a failure, or gaining advantage on a success. Not all opponents can cover all wagers, and most refuse to wager for more than a quarter of their net worth.</p><p>For each hour spent gambling, make a check using your tool set and consult Table: Gambling Outcomes (though in most situations, there’s only so much money to be won, and usually a few sore losers when the house is cleaned out).</p><p>TABLE: GAMBLING OUTCOMES</p><p>GAMBLING CHECK RESULTS</p><p>1 Lose wager + 50%</p><p>2–14 Lose wager</p><p>15–19 Break even</p><p>20–24 Earn twice your wager</p><p>25+ Earn three times your wager</p>",
