      "value": "<p>Made from herbal ingredients, this tin of soothing salve can help mend grievous injuries. You can apply medicinal salve to your or a willing creatureâ€™s wounds during a short rest. A creature treated with medicinal salve rolls a bonus hit die and adds the result to the total number of hit points regained during the short rest. When used with a bandage, the bonus hit die from a medicinal salve restores the maximum amount of hit points. Once a creature benefits from a medicinal salve, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest.</p>",
