      <p>This small vial of unstable magical waste can make for a powerful
      explosive. You can set and light one or more vials of unstable arcanum as
      an action, causing each to explode at the start of your next turn. Any
      creatures or objects within 10 feet of the exploding charge make a DC 14
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 force damage on a failure, or half
      damage on a success. Increase this damage by 2d10 for each charge set
      beyond the first. Whenever a creature carrying unstable arcanum takes
      damage from a spell or cantrip, it must roll a d4. On a result of a 1 the
      unstable arcanum instantly explodes as if set and lit.</p>
