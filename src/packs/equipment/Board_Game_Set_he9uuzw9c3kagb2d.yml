      <p>These items can be played to simply pass the time or to gain money
      through gambling. Gambling can potentially earn or lose money, depending
      on the amount you wager and the outcome of your check. You can also
      attempt to cheat opponents by making a Sleight of Hand check opposed by
      the highest Perception check among observers, turning your opponents
      hostile on a failure, or gaining advantage on a success. Not all opponents
      can cover all wagers, and most refuse to wager for more than a quarter of
      their net worth.</p><p>For each hour spent gambling, make a check using
      your tool set and consult Table: Gambling Outcomes (though in most
      situations, there’s only so much money to be won, and usually a few sore
      losers when the house is cleaned out).</p><p>TABLE: GAMBLING
