      glance this item seems to be perfectly typical, but it conceals a
      spring-loaded blade deployed by pressing a switch when it is used to make
      an attack.</p><p>A creature observing it only realizes that the item is a
      weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the
      weapon is being worn at the time and not deployed).</p><p>Once deployed, a
      bonus action is required to re-sheathe the blade. You gain an expertise
      die on your attack roll when you deploy this weapon as part of an attack
      against a target that is unaware you have it.</p><hr><p><b>Stealthy:</b>
      This armor or weapon has been disguised to look like a piece of clothing
      or other normal item. A creature observing the item only realizes that it
      is armor or a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with
      disadvantage if the armor is being worn at the time or the weapon is
      sheathed).</p>
