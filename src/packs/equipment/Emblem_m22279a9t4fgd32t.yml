      <p><strong><em>Divine Focus:</em></strong> These foci (often called holy
      symbols) are representations of a deity, pantheon, or ideal. They usually
      depict the crest or icon of a specific god or are of symbolic importance
      to a particular faith. Reliquaries, censers, amulets, emblems, or tattoos
      are often used as spellcasting foci by clerics and heralds.</p>
