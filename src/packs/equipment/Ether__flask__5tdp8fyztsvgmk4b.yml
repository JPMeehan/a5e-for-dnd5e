      <p>You can use the chemicals in this flask to soak a rag or other small
      cloth item. An open flask of ether or an ether-soaked rag retains its
      potency for 1 minute or until you hit with it. While you are grappling a
      creature, you may make a special melee weapon attack against it using
      ether. On a hit, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or
      fall unconscious. The creature remains unconscious for 1 minute, until it
      takes damage, or until an action is used to shake or slap the creature
      awake.</p><p>Applying a poison takes an action. A creature immune to the
      poisoned condition is immune to any effects from poisons.</p>
