      <p>You gain an expertise die on Dexterity saving throws. When you take the
      Dodge action while wielding a heavy shield, you may instead take cover
      behind your shield, gaining an expertise die to your Armor Class until the
      start of your turn.</p>

      <p>You cannot squeeze through spaces smaller than your size category.</p>

      <p>When you take a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block it and
      sacrifice your shield, turning the critical hit into a regular hit.
      Afterwards your shield is broken, or if your shield is magical it instead
      becomes mundane for 1 hour.</p>
