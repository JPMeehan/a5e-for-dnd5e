      <p>Characters raised in the grimlock culture&nbsp;share the following
      traits:</p>

      <p><strong>Grimlock Training.</strong> Choose two of
      the&nbsp;following:</p>

      <p><strong>Maintenance. </strong>You gain proficiency&nbsp;in the
      Engineering skill and with&nbsp;tinker&rsquo;s tools.</p>

      <p><strong>Medic. </strong>You gain proficiency in the&nbsp;Medicine skill
      and with herbalist&rsquo;s&nbsp;kits.</p>

      <p><strong>Security. </strong>You gain proficiency with&nbsp;the Stealth
      skill and with&nbsp;shortswords and shotguns.</p>

      <p><strong>Whatever&rsquo;s At Hand. </strong>You gain&nbsp;proficiency
      with improvised weapons.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Lightless Expertise. </strong>You never suffer disadvantage for
      being unable to see while making skill checks, so long as one of your
      other senses (such as touch or hearing) can compensate.</p>

      <p><strong>Languages. </strong>You can speak Common and Undercommon and
      you can read Grimlock texture writing, which uses the words and grammar of
      Undercommon. Because most grimlocks lack traditional sight, blind members
      of their society are not taught the written or signed forms of&nbsp;the
      languages they use to communicate.&nbsp;Grimlocks with darkvision learn
      the written&nbsp;and signed forms of Common and&nbsp;Undercommon
      normally.</p>

      <p>Additionally, many grimlocks (especially&nbsp;those of human, halfling,
      or dragonborn&nbsp;heritage) do not have eyes; their faces are&nbsp;smooth
      where their eyes would usually be,&nbsp;and their skulls lack eye sockets.
      The&nbsp;following traits are most commonly seen in&nbsp;grimlocks whose
      heritages lack the&nbsp;darkvision ability. If you wish, you gain
      the<br>following traits:</p>

      <p><strong>Blind. </strong>You are permanently blind and can&rsquo;t see
      beyond the range of your blindsight. You can&rsquo;t benefit from any
      ability or magical effect that would grant&nbsp;you visual sight or
      darkvision.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Your inability to see, however, is not without its advantages. You are
      immune to any illusion spell that relies on vision, such&nbsp;as blur,
      darkness, or invisibility, and you&nbsp;are also immune to attacks and
      effects&nbsp;that require meeting a creature&rsquo;s eyes,&nbsp;such as a
      medusa&rsquo;s petrifying gaze.&nbsp;Additionally, you gain an expertise
      die on&nbsp;Perception checks that don&rsquo;t rely on sight.</p>

      <p><strong>Echolocation. </strong>While you are not&nbsp;deafened, you
      have blindsight with a&nbsp;range of 60 feet. You count as being
      able&nbsp;to see targets within the range of your&nbsp;echolocation.</p>

      <p><strong>Sensitive Ears. </strong>Any time you take&nbsp;thunder damage,
      you make a Constitution&nbsp;save against a DC of 10 or half
      the&nbsp;damage taken, whichever is higher. On a&nbsp;failure, you are
      deafened until the end of&nbsp;your next turn.</p>
