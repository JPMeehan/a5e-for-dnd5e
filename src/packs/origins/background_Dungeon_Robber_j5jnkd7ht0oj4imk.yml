      <p>You seek the treasures of empires long vanished. The world&rsquo;s
      dungeons are brimming with lost secrets and artifacts of unimaginable
      power&mdash;and they belong in a museum, or at least in your living room.
      While others call you a tomb robber, you consider yourself an
      archaeologist, a collector, or an explorer.</p><p>Are you associated with
      a wizards&rsquo; college or institute of higher learning, or are you a
      private collector? Are you an idealist or a profiteer? What is the one
      relic or piece of knowledge that you&rsquo;d trade anything to
      find?</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Intelligence
      and one other ability score.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>
      History, and either Investigation or Religion.</p><p><strong>Tool
      Proficiencies:</strong> Cartographers&rsquo;
      tools.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Any six (three of them no longer
      spoken).</p><p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 18 gold):</strong>
      Cartographers&rsquo; tools, miner&rsquo;s pick, traveler&rsquo;s clothes,
      shovel.</p><p><em><strong>Feature: Unreliable Intelligence.</strong></em>
      You know conspiracy theorists, armchair historians, disgraced academics,
      and other people with useful, if unreliable, knowledge. While in a city,
      once per day you can find an NPC who can make an Intelligence check with a
      +10 bonus to recall a fact. When you do so, the Narrator secretly rolls a
      d6. On a 1, your contact&rsquo;s information is dangerously
      inaccurate.</p><p><em><strong>Adventures and Advancement:</strong></em> As
      you build your reputation, shady people approach you with requests to
      &ldquo;discover&rdquo; items of uncertain ownership. After enough
      successes, a legitimate organization, such as a wizard&rsquo;s college or
      esteemed museum, takes an interest in you. They offer you a position,
      which comes with funding granting a Wealthy lifestyle, access to free
      spellcasting services, and legal representation when you inevitably run
      afoul of the law.</p><h3><strong>DUNGEON ROBBER

      valuable curios.</p><p>8. Authorities who would like to question you about
