      Business</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;While in a city or town, you
      can maintain a moderate lifestyle by plying your trade. Furthermore, the
      guild occasionally informs you of jobs that need doing. Completing such a
      job might require performing a downtime activity, or it might require a
      full adventure. The guild provides a modest reward if you&rsquo;re
      successful.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong><em>Adventures and

      several quests or endeavors advancing guild business, you may be promoted

      addition, the guild supports you at a moderate lifestyle without you
      having to work.</p>
