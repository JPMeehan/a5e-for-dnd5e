      <p>Characters raised in the settler culture share a variety of traits in
      common with one another.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Claim
      Staker.</em></strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;tall fence and the grit to defend it is
      often all it takes to stake a claim out on the frontier. Whenever you
      begin a&nbsp;long rest</span>, you can choose to spend the first hour of
      that rest making the area into a fortified position for the duration.
      While resting in a fortified position, the ground in a 60-foot radius area
      around you is considered&nbsp;difficult terrain</span>&nbsp;for any
      creatures other than those you consider allies. In addition, the first
      time a hidden creature enters the fortified area, it must make a
      Dexterity&nbsp;<span>saving throw&nbsp;(DC 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your
      proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature inadvertently makes
      loud noises and is no longer hidden.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Frontier
      Survival.</em></strong>&nbsp;You are proficient in the Insight and
      Survival skills.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Strange
      Forager.</em></strong>&nbsp;You gain an&nbsp;<span>expertise die&nbsp;on
      any check made to determine if something is
      poisonous.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Languages.&nbsp;</em></strong>You can
      speak, read, sign, and write Common, and two additional languages.</p>
