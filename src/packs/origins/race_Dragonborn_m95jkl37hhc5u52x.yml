      <h2>Dragonborn Traits</h2><p>Characters with the dragonborn heritage share
      a variety of traits in common with one
      another.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Young dragonborn are largely
      indepen- dent within hours of hatching. They develop quickly, reaching the
      equivalent development of an adolescent human by the age of 3, and then
      fully maturing into adults by the age of 15. Their maximum life span is
      about 80 years.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dragonborn have
      imposing statures. Most stand well over 6 feet tall and weigh between 250
      and 300 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Dragon Breath.</strong></em> Drawing upon great
      reservoirs of draconic power, you can unleash magical destruction upon
      your foes. You can use your dragon breath as an action.</p><p>Choose the
      type of damage dealt by your breath weapon from the following list: acid,
      cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or
      thunder.</p><p>Additionally, choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet
      wide or a 15-foot cone for the area that your breath weapon affects. Each
      creature in the breath&rsquo;s area makes a Dexterity saving throw. If
      your breath weapon deals psychic damage, a Wisdom saving throw is made
      instead of Dexterity; if cold, necrotic, poison, radiant, or thunder, a
      Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your
      Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><p>A creature takes 2d6
      damage on a failed saving throw, or half damage on a success. The damage
      increases to 3d6 at 4th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at 14th level, and
      6d6 at 19th level.</p><p>After you use your dragon breath, you can&rsquo;t
      use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Dragonborn
      Gifts</h2><p>Dragonborn are diverse and highly varied even within a single
      draconic progenitor&rsquo;s bloodline. In addition to the traits found in
      your dragonborn heritage, select one of the following dragonborn
      gifts.</p><h3>Draconic Armor</h3><p>Some dragonborn grow tougher scales
      and sharper claws. These dragonborn tend to have short tails, wide faces,
      and broad shoulders, all of which are usually ridged with hardened scales
      or tipped with spikes. You have the following
      traits:</p><p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em> You grow retractable claws
      from the tips of your fingers. Extending or retracting the claws requires
      no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make
      unarmed strikes that deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength
      modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance
      to the damage type dealt by your Dragon
      Breath.</p><p><em><strong>Scales.</strong></em> You have tough interlocked
      draconic scales. While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 +
      your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this
      benefit.</p><h3>Draconic Fins</h3><p>Some dragonborn seem naturally
      adapted to aquatic environments with sleek, hydrodynamic, and often
      reflective scales. These dragonborn tend to have webbed hands and feet,
      and long serpentine tails. They also tend to grow soft fin-like scales
      along their legs and forearms. You have the following
      traits:</p><p><em><strong>Swimmer.</strong></em> You have a swimming speed
      of 30 feet and you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a
      time.</p><p><em><strong>Deep Darkvision. </strong></em>You can see in dim
      light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
      if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only
      shades of gray. In addition, your eyes are perfectly adapted for spotting
      movement at depth, and the radius of your darkvision increases to 120 feet
      while underwater.</p><p><em><strong>Hard to Hit.</strong></em> You either
      have a tough shell or your quick movements and reflective scales make you
      difficult to strike. While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals
      12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this
      benefit.</p><h3>Draconic Wings</h3><p>Some dragonborn are born with
      draconic wings. They tend to have slender frames and smooth scale
      patterns, along with a&nbsp;long rudder-like tail to help them fly with
      their stocky wings. They&rsquo;re far too heavy and lack the strength to
      really soar like&nbsp;true dragons, but their wings still allow them to
      lift off and fly a considerable&nbsp;distance before
      tiring.</p><p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> You have a fly speed of 30
      feet. To use this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor.
      Whenever you spend 3 full consec- utive rounds airborne without landing,
      you gain a level of fatigue. Any fatigue gained in this way is removed
      upon finishing a short or long rest.</p><h2>Draconic Paragon</h2><p>With
      enough time and training any dragonborn can unlock their draconic
      potential. When you reach 10th level, your dragonborn gift dramatically
      improves.</p><p>In addition, you gain resistance to the damage type dealt
      by your Dragon Breath. If you already have resistance to that type of
      damage, you gain immunity to it instead.</p><h3>Impenetrable Draconic
      Armor</h3><p>Your claws and scales harden to the deadly consis- tency of a
      true dragon. Your claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength
      modifier, and your AC increases by 1.</p><h3>Mighty Draconic
      Wings</h3><p>Your fly speed increases to 40 feet and you can fly while
      wearing medium or heavy armor. When you would suffer fatigue from using
      your fly speed, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + 1 per
      previous save in the last minute). On a success, you do not suffer fatigue
      from flying that round.</p><h3>Sleek Draconic Fins</h3><p>Your swim speed
      increases to 45 feet, you can breathe underwater, and your darkvision
      increases to 120 feet (or 240 feet while underwater).</p><p>Additionally,
      while underwater you gain an exper- tise die on saving throws and weapon
      attack rolls.</p><h2>Suggested Cultures</h2><p>While you can choose any
      culture for your dragon- born character, the dragonbound and dragoncult
      cultures are linked closely with this heritage.</p>
