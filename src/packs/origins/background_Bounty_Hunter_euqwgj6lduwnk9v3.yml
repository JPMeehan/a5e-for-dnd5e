      <p dir="ltr">Enforcers, mercenaries, and &ldquo;private
      contractors.&rdquo; When the people of means (legal authorities,
      aristocrafts, and crime bosses) are unable to reach their offenders, they
      hire out these needs to people such as yourself who aren&rsquo;t afraid to
      get their hands a little dirty while on the hunt. No doubt, most
      adventurers could call themselves bounty hunters, but few adventurers
      dedicated their previous lives to this profession&mdash;which to the
      surprise of many does have certain standards of behavior. After all, you
      don&rsquo;t bring people kicking-and-screaming to the feet of the law (or
      whomever) out of your sense of charity.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">What draws you to this unsavory line of work? Maybe you have
      tough skin, allowing you to think of this as &ldquo;just a job.&rdquo; Do
      you represent the scum and villainy whose true joy is dominating your
      captives? Or maybe people consider you a pillar of the community for
      ousting said scum and villainy. In your line of work, there is no way to
      please everyone&mdash;so who considers you the bad guy?</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Bounty Hunter Traits</h3>

      either Deception, Insight, Investigation, or Stealth.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One gaming set (any),

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Feature: Bounty Boards.</strong> You know the common
      procedures for finding information on wanted people. When you are in a
      community such as a settlement or a district of a large city, you can
      spend 1 hour gathering leads on bounties. You learn about one of the
      following: a villainous threat to this community, a wanted small-time
      criminal, the identity of a local crime group, a noble looking for
      &ldquo;a trustworthy employee,&rdquo; or a commoner wronged by any of
      these. You can express which you prefer, but the information you find is
      determined by the Narrator. Whatever person or group you learn about, you
      get a lead on their location and some assurance of payment for your
      work.&nbsp;</p>

      and Advancement. </strong>Consistent, clean bounty collection may capture
      the attention of a generous employer&hellip; It can also cause factions
      you cross to put a bounty on&nbsp; your head! If you silence your rivals
      and those who would retaliate against you, you might just find yourself in
      a position of power&mdash;the right-hand of a noble, politician, or
      criminal.</p>
