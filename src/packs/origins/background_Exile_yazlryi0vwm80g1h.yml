      <p>Your homeland is barred to you and you wander strange lands. You will
      never be mistaken for a local but you find ready acceptance among other
      adventurers, many of which are as rootless as you are.</p>

      <p>Are you a banished noble? A refugee from war or from an undead
      uprising? A dissident or a criminal on the run? Or a stranded traveler
      from an unreachable distant land?</p>
