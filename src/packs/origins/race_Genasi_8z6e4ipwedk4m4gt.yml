      <h2>Genasi Paragon</h2>

      <p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar among elemental
      planetouched, and you gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3>Elemental Scion</h3>

      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong></em>Child of the Elements
      feature</p>

      <p>The damage resistances you gained through Child of the Elements
      improves to immunity.</p>

      <h3>Elemental Piercing</h3>

      <p>Choose one damage type from the following: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning,
      or Thunder. When you deal damage of that type, you can treat a creature
      with immunity to that damage as though it only had resistance, and you can
      treat a creature with resistance to that damage type as though it did not
      have resistance.</p>

      <p>When you roll for damage with your chosen damage type against a
      creature with neither immunity or resistance against it, re-roll any
      damage dice which land on a 1 until each damage die lands on a 2 or
      higher; replace the result.</p>

      <h2>Genasi Culture</h2>

      <p>Genasi are, as people, incredibly rare&mdash;even by planetouched
      standards. There are very few instances where elemental planetouched
      existed in such proportions as to make their own societies. The remarkably
      rare genasi nation leaves an indelible mark on a setting. They are often
      brought upon by a major magical occurrence: the emergence of genasi
      communities from another world, a massive upwelling of elemental magic,
      and interplanar collisions.</p>

      <p>Genasi are much more disposed either to adopt the culture they were
      born into, or set out at an early age to find people who understand them.
      Some genasi families, in their quest to assimilate, fall through the
      cracks of society&mdash;leading to a surprisingly high number of orphans
      who are secretly genasi. It also is rumored that some cultures and regions
      have higher odds of manifesting genasi children.</p>

      <h3>Suggested Cultures</h3>

      <p>While you can choose any culture for your genasi character, the
      following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: atlantean,
      circusfolk, elemental-bound, forsaken, islander, and lone wanderer.</p>
