      <p>Characters raised in the dragoncult culture share a variety of traits
      in common with one another.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Draconic
      Umbra.&nbsp;</em></strong>Dragon cultists are often blessed with power
      from the object of their devotion so that they may spread their
      dragon&rsquo;s word or further its plans. As a bonus action, you can cause
      draconic power to course around you in a draconic umbra. This draconic
      umbra lasts for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to end it. Once
      you have used this trait, you cannot use it again until after you finish
      a&nbsp;long rest</span>&nbsp;. Choose one of the following
      effects:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Damaging Umbra:&nbsp;</em>Common amongst the
      chromatic dragons, this umbra burns with draconic power. Once on each of
      your turns while this umbra is active, you can deal extra damage of the
      type dealt by your Dragon Breath to one target when you deal damage to it
      with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals half your level
      (minimum 1). If you are not dragonborn, you may choose the damage type
      dealt by your umbra from those available in the Dragon Breath
      trait.</p><p><em>Ethereal Umbra:</em>&nbsp;Common amongst the essence
      dragons, this umbra shimmers with draconic will. While this umbra is
      active you can move through nonmagical solid objects and occupied spaces
      as if they were&nbsp;difficult terrain</span>&nbsp;. Opportunity attacks
      made against you while this umbra is active
      have&nbsp;disadvantage</span>&nbsp;. You cannot move further than 5 feet
      into walls or other solid objects in this way. If you would end your turn
      in an occupied space, you are shunted into the nearest unoccupied space
      and take 1d6 force damage.</p><p><em>Spiritual Umbra:&nbsp;</em>Common
      amongst the gem dragons, this umbra shifts with draconic cunning. While
      this umbra is active you gain an&nbsp;expertise die&nbsp;on&nbsp;Stealth
      checks, and once on each of your turns you may alter your appearance (as
      the @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.vemj08hawvmf44ya]{disguise self}
      spell). When your umbra ends, so do any illusions conjured by
      it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Protective Umbra:&nbsp;</em>Common amongst the
      metallic dragons, this umbra sparks with draconic ingenuity. While this
      umbra is active you gain&nbsp;<span>resistance&nbsp;to the damage type
      dealt by your Dragon Breath (if you already had resistance to that damage
      type, you gain&nbsp;<span>immunity&nbsp;instead), and you gain
      an&nbsp;<span>expertise die&nbsp;on Wisdom or Intelligence checks. If you
      are not dragonborn, you may choose the damage type for your umbra from
      those available in the Dragon Breath trait.</p><p><strong><em>Secrets of
      the Wyrm.&nbsp;</em></strong>Draconic cults require diverse skill sets and
      the utmost secrecy. Choose two skills from among Arcana, Deception,
      Persuasion, Religion, or Stealth. You have proficiency in&nbsp;the chosen
      skills.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Languages.&nbsp;</em></strong>You can
      speak, read, write, and sign Common and Draconic.</p>
