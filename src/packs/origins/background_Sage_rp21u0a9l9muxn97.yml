      Privileges</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;As a fellow or friend of
      several universities you have visiting access to the great libraries, most
      of which are off-limits to the general public. With enough time spent in a
      library, you can uncover most of the answers you seek (any question
      answerable with a DC 20&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History,
      Nature, or Religion check).</p><p><strong><em>Adventures and
      Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>When you visit libraries
      and universities you tend to be asked for help in your role as a
      comparatively rough-and-tumble adventurer. After fetching a few bits of
      esoteric knowledge and settling a few academic disputes, you may be
      granted access to the restricted areas of the library (which contain
      darker secrets and deeper mysteries, such as those answerable with a DC
      25&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion
      check).</p><h3><strong>SAGE CONNECTIONS</strong></h3><ol><li>Your rival

      apprentice who ran away after mastering magical power but not the
      theoretical foundation to control it.</li><li>The invading general who
      burned the library that was once your home.</li></ol><hr><h3><strong>SAGE
