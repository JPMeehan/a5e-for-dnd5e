      <p dir="ltr">Innkeeps, chefs, baristas, and bartenders. The inns and
      taverns where barkeeps work are essential to the economy of the fantasy
      world&mdash;how else will towns attract the adventurers they so
      desperately need? Of course, your role is also essential for the everyday
      people, giving them venu to congregate and celebrate, an outlet for their
      energy. As such, barkeeps are frequently a pillar in their community,
      becoming a local celebrity for whatever personality they have. Who could
      forget the charismatic dwarf bartender with their shirt sleeves rolled up,
      or the hot-headed but motherly halfling who helps everyone feel safe?</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Inns and taverns are some of the best means of income in the
      world of fantasy&mdash;so why become an adventurer? Does your old
      establishment still exist, or was it tragically destroyed? Do you still
      have good relations there, or were you dramatically outcast? How do the
      skills of your old life apply to you as an adventurer now?</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Feature: Service With a Smile.</strong>&nbsp;When you
      are in a settlement where you haven't made yourself unpopular, you can ply
      your trade at a local tavern or inn. As compensation you earn room and
      board (modest lifestyle) for yourself plus a number of creatures equal to
      your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher, minimum of 1).
      While plying your trade in this way, you can Gather Information
      simultaneously with no penalty.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Adventures and Advancement.</strong>&nbsp;After
      enough adventures, you are rewarded with the deed to your own inn or
      tavern (or enough money to buy back or rebuild the one you lost). This
      establishment is a Grade 1 Tavern which you can upgrade further at your
      own expense.</p>
