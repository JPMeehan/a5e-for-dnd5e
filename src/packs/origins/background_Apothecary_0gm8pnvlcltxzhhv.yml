      <p>Your trade is the healing arts&mdash;but different cultures each have
      their own medical traditions. You might be a scholar of&nbsp;medicine
      (&ldquo;doctor&rdquo;), a medical alchemist, a nurse at a religious
      institution, a combat medic, or even a &ldquo;witch&rdquo; whose services
      are poorly understood. You might even be one who has turned their back on
      healing, using your medical knowledge to undermine mortal lives.</p>

      <p>What is your medical tradition, and who was your teacher? Does your
      role garner you the respect or ire of your community? Are you called to
      adventure by your&nbsp; compassion, dire circumstance, or the chance for
      glory?</p>
