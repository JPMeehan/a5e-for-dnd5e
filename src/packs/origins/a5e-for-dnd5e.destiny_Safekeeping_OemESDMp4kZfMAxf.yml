      <p id="docs-internal-guid-26c92929-7fff-fcf8-99cf-28602d99b38d"
      dir="ltr">There are important things in the world that deserve to be
      preserved including (but by no means limited to) works of art, natural
      resources, places of beauty or power, communities, philosophies, and
      one-of-a-kind objects. You have dedicated your life to preserving and
      protecting something, or perhaps multiple somethings be those things
      abstract or concrete.</p>

      <hr>

      <p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Source of Inspiration: Protection.</strong></em>
      You derive inspiration from keeping things safe from harm, or implementing
      protective measures to prevent disasters in the future.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><em>Save someone&rsquo;s life or prevent them from suffering
      a life-altering injury, make additional copies of a unique work and ensure
      they are distributed to multiple places so it cannot be lost, record the
      lore of a community for posterity, prevent the destruction of a
      relationship through mediation, pass down a skill or tradition in danger
      of being lost, stop the theft or destruction of something valuable or
      dangerous.</em></p>

      <p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Inspiration Feature: Guardian&rsquo;s
      Gaze.</strong></em> Your vigilance and commitment to preservation can make
      a huge difference in moments when it counts, albeit at the cost of your
      own safety. When a friendly creature or precious object within 15 feet of
      you would be harmed by an attack or some detrimental effect, you can spend
      your inspiration (no action required) to cause that attack or effect to
      target you instead.</p>

      <hr>

      <h4>FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY</h4>

      <p dir="ltr">You fulfill your destiny when you prevent the loss of
      something truly massive.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><em>Save an entire region or world from a catastrophe, bring
      a species back from the brink of extinction, prevent the destruction of a
      culture, rescue an artistic masterwork from a disaster or war, prevent an
      apocalyptic event, cure a plague that threatens the lives of
      thousands.</em></p>

      <p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Fulfillment Feature: Eternal
      Guardian.</strong></em> You have done so much in the service of
      preservation that you yourself are preserved, becoming ageless. Your
      effective physical age becomes early middle age (the equivalent of 35 for
      a human) or if you are already older when you achieve this feature you
      slowly de-age to that level of physical ability. You may still retain some
      gray hair or wrinkles (player&rsquo;s discretion) to mark your wisdom and
      experience. You no longer age (and cannot die of old age or have your
      effective age altered by magic), are resistant to poison and necrotic
      damage, have advantage on saves against poison, and are immune to disease.
      In addition, if you were already resistant to poison or necrotic damage,
      you become immune to that type of damage instead.</p>
