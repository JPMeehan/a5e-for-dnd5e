      <p>In the lands where the dinosaurs dwell, there are people who live in
      harmony with the thunder- lizards and even ride them into battle.
      Elves,&nbsp;halflings, humans, and dragonborn have all formed dino- riding
      cultures, each with their own approach to incorporating dinosaurs into
      their society. Among the dragonborn, some consider dinosaurs to be their
      very distant kin (much to the chagrin of druids who seem incapable of
      debunking this myth). Halfling dino-riders are particularly formidable,
      since their dinosaur war-beasts are smaller and easier to
      raise.</p><p>Spiritual traditions among the dino-riders are varied, but
      often center an intense connection to dinokind. Many choose to personally
      identify with a particular species as a sort of devotional crest,
      incorporating this creature&rsquo;s disposition as their personal moral
      compass. This resonance allows them to bond with dinosaurs of any type on
      a deeply spiritual level. Religious scholars from other cultures have yet
      to even scratch the surface of this tradition.</p><h3>Dino-Rider
      Traits</h3><p>Characters raised in a dino-rider culture share a variety of
      traits in common with one another.</p><p><strong>Dino-Rites.</strong> You
      resonate with an iconic variety of dinosaur, the secret magic of which
      conveys to you a certain benefit. Choose
      one:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flier</strong>&mdash;Airborne fishers
      like<br>pteranodon and quezaquatalus.<br>You have an aura that
      allows<br>you to glide. When you fall, if you aren&rsquo;t incapacitated,
      you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for ever 1 foot you descend. You
      are immune to falling damage as long as you aren't
      incapacitated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hunter</strong>&mdash;Aggressive
      predators like dilophosaurus and deinonychus. You can use this trait as a
      bonus action to move your speed toward an enemy you can see or hear. Once
      you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you complete a short
      or long rest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Juggernaut</strong>&mdash;Armored
      giants like the triceratops and stegosaurus. You have an aura of
      resilience, granting you AC equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier, or as
      determined by your armor, whichever is better. This stacks with the AC
      provided by a
      shield.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sharp-Tooth</strong>&mdash;Fanged tyrants
      like allosaurus and spinosaurus. You have a bite attack, a natural weapon
      dealing 1d8 piercing damage. (Your bite uses Strength for attack and
      damage rolls. This is not an unarmed strike.) Some adherents of this path
      have a pronounced&mdash;even exaggerated&mdash;jawline or
      underbite.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thunderer</strong>&mdash;Herbivorous
      titans like diplodocus and brontosaurus. You can use this trait to cast
      thunderwave once between long rests. Your spellcasting ability for this
      spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Dino-Wrangler.</strong> You are
      proficient in Animal Handling, land vehicles, and your choice of either
      Nature or Survival. You gain an expertise die on checks made to interact
      with or recall information about dinosaurs.</p><p><strong>Spirit Bond
      (Dinosaur). </strong>You can designate one willing mount to be bonded with
      your spirit, which lasts until you or that creature dies, or until you
      designate a different one as part of a long rest. While riding on your
      bonded mount, if it is untrained you can still control it as if it were
      trained. If this creature is a dinosaur, it gains spell resistance
      (advantage on saving throws against
      spells).</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, write, and
      sign Common, plus one other language.</p>
