      <p dir="ltr">Many myths recount that the first selkies were created when a
      ship capsized in a tempest. The Ocean itself responded to the cries of the
      doomed travelers by transforming them into seals, allowing them to weather
      the storm and swim to safety. However, while the Ocean permitted them to
      return to their humanoid form, it henceforward claimed a part of them and
      their descendants for itself. Now burdened with this irrepressible
      longing, the new selkies chose to create a new life between the sea and
      the shore, forever becoming creatures of two worlds.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In their humanoid form, selkies resemble humans, although
      they are generally heavier-set than the average human, and some have
      slight webbing present between their fingers and toes that hint at their
      true heritage. What sets selkies apart is that each is born with a magical
      seal skin that grows alongside them, and which many choose to wear as a
      cape or cloak while in humanoid form. While wearing this skin, a selkie
      may change into a seal (or sea lion, for some lineages) at will, allowing
      them to prosper in climates and environments where many other heritages
      would perish.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Because their seal form is so integral to both their identity
      and their survival, many selkies associate completely doffing their skin
      with emotional vulnerability and intimacy: a fact that often leads to
      confusion and misunderstandings when selkies encounter other humanoid
      heritages! This is not helped by the fact that many selkie lineages tend
      toward more extreme sexual dimorphism in both their seal and humanoid
      forms, giving them hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine features. It is
      therefore no surprise that many non-selkie communities&rsquo; first (and
      often only) interaction with a selkie involves a clandestine love affair
      or sudden elopement. In consequence, while selkies are relatively rare in
      terms of raw numbers, half-selkies are proportionately more common than
      would otherwise be expected.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">However, no matter where passions may draw them, the Ocean
      always maintains pride of place in a selkie&rsquo;s heart. A selkie can
      feel the push and pull of the tides beckoning them at all times,
      regardless of the distance, and selkies that stray too far from the sea
      for too long have been known to die of sorrow.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Selkie Traits</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">Characters with the selkie heritage share a variety of traits
      in common with one another.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Type.</strong> Your type is Fey as well as
      Humanoid.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Age.</strong> Selkies have shorter lifespans than
      most humanoids, reaching maturity at 14 and typically living 55-65 years.
      However, aging also wears down the selkie body less than it does for most
      humanoids, making them often appear comparable to a human 80% their
      age.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Size.</strong> In their humanoid form selkies are
      comparable in height to humans, but hold more body fat at healthy weights,
      making them noticeably heavier-set on average. Your size is Medium.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Speed.</strong> Your speed is 30 feet, and you have a
      swim speed equal to your speed.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Insulated. </strong>You are protected against arctic
      temperatures and the frigid depths. You have resistance to cold
      damage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Sea-Longings.</strong> The depths always call to you,
      no matter where you go. You always know the distance and direction of the
      nearest sea, and you can never become lost by non-magical means while at
      sea. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, this feature may also apply to
      similar bodies of water, such as large lakes or underground
      oceans.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Seal Skin. </strong>You were born with a magical seal
      skin that grows with you and which may be worn alongside other clothes and
      armor. As a bonus action while wearing the skin, you may shapeshift into
      either a seal or sea lion, chosen at character creation. You cannot later
      change your choice. In either case, your alternate form is referred to as
      your &ldquo;seal form.&rdquo; Your skin is specific to you and cannot be
      used by any other creature, even another selkie.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">While in seal form, you retain your hit points, as well as
      the Sea-Longings and Insulated features from the selkie base heritage.
      Likewise, you may still choose to use features that grant you an alternate
      AC (such as the berserker&rsquo;s Rugged Defense feature) if they do not
      require armor. Any equipment you are wearing or wielding merges into your
      new form and has no effect until you leave the form.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You may remain in your seal form indefinitely, including
      while unconscious. However, your transformation ends if you are reduced to
      0 hit points or choose to end it as a bonus action.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">If you gain the Wild Shape feature, this feature does not
      gain any of its benefits. If you lose your skin, you can create new skin
      for yourself using the regenerate spell or by using magic of similar or
      greater power, subject to Narrator discretion.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Selkie Gifts</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">A selkie&rsquo;s physical seal form is not the only way in
      which they resemble the sea. With a capacity for astounding depth as well
      as relentless fury, selkies embody an oceanic mystery that few can delve.
      In addition to the traits found in your selkie heritage, select one of the
      following gifts.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Allure</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">Selkies have a reputation for astounding beauty, but also an
      aura of secrecy that many find deeply compelling. While some selkies bear
      this aura with an almost na&iuml;ve simplicity, others have learned to
      actively employ it to their advantage. You gain the following trait:</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Captivating Creature.</strong> You gain an expertise
      die on Deception, Performance, and Persuasion checks when interacting with
      non-hostile humanoids.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Heavyweight</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">Empowered by both physical bulk and a strong territorial
      instinct, selkies possessing this gift rarely give way to others. Most
      common among male selkies who must fight for every ounce of respect among
      their peers, heavyweights tolerate no rivals. You gain the following
      trait:</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Hold Your Ground. </strong>You gain an expertise die
      on saving throws to resist being knocked prone or subjected to forced
      movement.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Throw Your Weight Around.</strong> When you deal
      basic melee damage using the Shove, Knockdown, or Overrun maneuvers, you
      add your proficiency bonus to the damage. Your maneuver DC for these
      maneuvers increases by 2.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Marine Mystic</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">The Ocean makes a deeper claim on some selkies than most, and
      in turn they are invited to partake in the secrets of this primordial
      entity. Marine mystics hear more than the murmurings of the currents below
      the waters; they know from whence the waves came and where they will fall.
      You gain the following trait:</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Hear the Ocean.</strong> You have inherent knowledge
      of the Aquan language. In addition, aquatic beasts and monstrosities
      understand anything you verbally communicate to them in Aquan, and you can
      understand them in return.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Time and Tide. </strong>You have a limited ability to
      see into the future. You gain the Premonition sign of faith from the
      cleric class.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Selkie Paragon</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">When you reach 10th level, you become an exemplar among
      selkies and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Fearsome Roar</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">Once between each short and long rest, you may activate the
      Bloody Roar maneuver without using exertion.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Curse Weaver</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">Once per long rest, you may cast bestow curse at 5th level
      without a spell slot. You may choose either Wisdom or Charisma as your
      spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Ocean&rsquo;s Envoy</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">You may cast water breathing once per long rest without a
      spell slot. When you cast this spell in this way, creatures you affect
      also gain a swim speed equal to their speed for the duration of the
      spell.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Selkie Culture</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">A selkie&rsquo;s seal form not only profoundly influences
      their physical being, but also their mental and social life. Often, they
      will act in a manner that parallels the behavior of the species of their
      seal form, e.g. sea lion selkies will often prefer to live in large
      groups, while leopard seal selkies tend to prefer their own company to
      that of others. As the species of their seal form is a heritable trait,
      these inclinations and tendencies are typically reinforced by the
      aggregate behavior of different selkie families until they become cultures
      unto themselves. While most selkie communities do not strictly prohibit
      the marriage of selkies with different seal forms, many individual
      families take great pride in their ancestry and encourage their children
      to seek partners of a similar stock.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Selkie expectations surrounding gender roles are also
      influenced by their seal forms, although more indirectly. Because selkies
      tend toward greater physical differentiation between the sexes in both
      their seal and humanoid forms than most other heritages, they often
      develop strong notions regarding what kinds of behaviors and
      characteristics are appropriate for men or women, although the strength
      and content of these expectations may vary markedly between different
      communities. Selkies that have been frequently exposed to predominantly
      non-selkie cultures typically do not have such strong preconceptions, and
      some intentionally join other communities specifically to escape such
      norms.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">No matter their lineage, sex, or circumstances, a
      selkie&rsquo;s bond to the Ocean invariably makes its mark on their life.
      Some take this connection so seriously as to pursue it as a religious
      vocation, but even those who attempt to ignore its beckoning are often
      drawn in by the material advantages it affords them; selkies are widely
      regarded as among the greatest sailors in the world, to the extent that
      some captains consider it bad luck to leave port without at least one in
      their crew. As such, selkies with a mind to make their fortune can almost
      always find a path to do so, albeit not without its perils.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Suggested Cultures</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">While you can choose any culture for your selkie character,
      the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: Beach
      Raider, Circusfolk, Depths Dovatary, Islander, Lone Wanderer, New
      Sealander, and Selkie Harem.</p>
