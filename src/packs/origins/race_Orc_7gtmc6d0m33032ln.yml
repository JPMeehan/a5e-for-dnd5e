      <h2>Orc Traits</h2><p>Characters with orc heritage share the following
      traits:</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Orcs mature faster than
      humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster,
      usually only living to be 60&ndash;75 years
      old.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Orcs are rarely under 6 feet
      tall, and weigh somewhere over 200 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Your orcish blood
      grants you superior vision in dark or dim conditions. You can see in dim
      light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
      if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy Lifter.</strong></em> When determining your
      carrying capacity and the weight that you can push, drag, or lift, your
      size is considered to be Large.</p><p>Note: A creature can only be
      considered a maximum of one size larger or smaller when determining how
      much Supply and weight it can carry.</p><p><em><strong>Mighty
      Attacks.</strong></em> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon
      attack, you can roll one of the weapon&rsquo;s damage dice an additional
      time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p><h2>Orcish
      Gifts</h2><p>While most orcs are all lumped into the same category, there
      are actually multiple orcish heritages that hail from different regions
      and environs. Those whose ancestors are from barren deserts have adapted
      in different ways from those who historically dwelled in the forests or
      plains. Additionally, those few tribes that revel in battle have grown to
      have different traits than those that value family or their ancestors
      above all else. In addition to the traits granted by your orcish heritage,
      choose one of the following heritage
      gifts.</p><h3>Acclimatized</h3><p>Your family hails from an area known for
      its extreme conditions, such as the arctic, desert, or even a particularly
      treacherous swamp. Even if you have not spent much time there, the ability
      of your family to adapt to their living conditions has been passed down to
      you. Orcs with this gift can vary wildly in appearance due to the area
      which they are from; those from the desert may have taken on a paler,
      dusky skin tone in order to survive the heat, while those from the arctic
      may have a coating of fine hairs and darker skin tones in order to retain
      heat.</p><p><em><strong>Just Like Home.</strong></em> Choose one type of
      terrain, reflecting the area from which your family hails: arctic, desert,
      mountain, or swamp. You ignore all naturally created difficult terrain of
      that type. Additionally, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made
      within this terrain type, and gain a type of damage resistance related to
      your chosen terrain: arctic &mdash; cold, desert &mdash; fire, mountain
      &mdash; lightning, swamp &mdash; poison.</p><h3>Ancestral
      Blessing</h3><p>Orcs with this gift are believed to have been blessed by
      their ancestors. Every family has their own beliefs for why this occurs;
      it could be to honor the good deeds of their parents, the success of their
      clan in battle or the arts, or even to take pity on a child in a desperate
      situation. Orcs with this heritage often seem to have a sort of divine
      aura that sets them apart. You have the following
      traits:</p><p><em><strong>Divine Protection.</strong></em> You have
      resistance to radiant damage.</p><p><em><strong>Touch of
      Divinity.</strong></em> You know the <em>resistance </em>cantrip. In
      addition, you can cast the <em>shield</em> spell once per long
      rest.</p><h3>Magic Adept</h3><p>The true origin of the magic adepts
      &mdash; the odanti &mdash; has been lost to time, but the elders tell
      tales of fey-touched ancestors and the tribe&rsquo;s proclivity for
      magic.</p><p>You are born with magic coursing through your veins, and are
      able to utilize it in a number of ways. You learn one cantrip of your
      choice from the wizard spell list. At 3rd level, choose one 1st- or
      2nd-level spell from the wizard spell list. You can cast the chosen spell
      without any material components once per long rest. A 1st-level spell
      chosen this way can be cast at 2nd-level using this trait, if the spell
      allows. Your spellcasting ability for this trait is the same as the
      ability score used in the spellcasting class in which you have the highest
      level, or Charisma if you have no levels in a spellcasting
      class.</p><h2>Orc Paragon</h2><p>Starting at 10th level, you become a
      paragon of orcishness. You gain the following feature.</p><h3>Relentless
      Resilience</h3><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed
      outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you have used this
      trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p><p>Additionally, the many struggles of your ancestors has given
      you a thick skin, and the ability to shrug off less powerful blows. Your
      Armor Class increases by 1.</p><h2>Suggested Cultures</h2><p>While you can
      choose any culture for your orc character, the following cultures are
      linked closely with this heritage: caravanner, stoic orc, wildling.</p>
