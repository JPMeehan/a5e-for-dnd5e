      <p>The fomorians (singular: fomor) are a subterranean kingdom of
      half-giants who consider themselves the one true culture
      of&nbsp;giantkind. They are known for surface raids, subterranean
      territory disputes, and astounding underground marble
      architecture&mdash;especially abandoned cities now infested with
      aberrations. In what little territory they still control, fomorians live
      in isolated city-states ruled by hereditary god-kings who promise the
      people the glory of ages past.</p><p>At the end of the Golden Age of
      Giants, mortals began worshiping the gods and stopped worshiping the
      elementals&mdash;and by extension the giants who claimed to be their
      emissaries. The pro-giant nationalist movement which became the fomorians,
      looking for a kingdom where they could keep practicing things &ldquo;the
      way they are,&rdquo; sought to establish a new empire in the Underland...
      But the denizens of the Underland had different ideas. It was not long
      before the unified fomor empire was smashed to bits. The city- states
      which remain are but a shred of what their predecessors had hoped would
      have formed a great fomorian tapestry.</p><p>The friendliness of fomor
      enclaves vary, and most could be called insular at best. Some fomor
      city-states embody the most noble (even if haughty and propagandized)
      traditions inherited from giantkind. Others are openly xenophobic. Given
      the proximity and conflict with the aberrations that live in the
      Underland, some scholars hypothesize that the most vicious fomor groups
      are those under the influence of (or co-opted entirely by) aboleths and
      their ilk.</p><p>Both through their own inclination and through aberrant
      influences, fomorians practice a type of alchemy that mutates their body
      and enhances their strengths&mdash;most especially a magical capability
      called &ldquo;the evil eye.&rdquo;</p><p>Fomorians who would consider
      joining an adventuring party might include: raiders looking for treasure,
      sages investigating changes to the surface world, seekers on a spiritual
      quest, diplomats, and survivors of attacks from alien
      invaders.</p><h3>Fomor Traits</h3><p>Characters raised in the fomor
