      <h2>Doppelganger Traits</h2>

      <p>Characters with the doppelganger heritage share the following
      traits:</p>

      <p><strong>Age. </strong>Doppelgangers age much as humans do, typically
      living a century or less. Their&nbsp;apparent age is a matter of
      choice.</p>

      <p><strong>Size. </strong>In their true form, doppelgangers can&nbsp;stand
      anywhere from 3 to 6 feet tall, but&nbsp;they can adopt the size and build
      of any&nbsp;Small or Medium humanoid. Your true size&nbsp;is Small or
      Medium.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed.</strong> 30 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Darkvision. </strong>You have darkvision out to
      60&nbsp;feet.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Shapeshifter. </strong>As an action, you can change your form
      and your voice to that of any Small or Medium humanoid creature you have
      seen before, or back into your true form. Your clothing and equipment are
      not transformed. You revert to your true form if you die.</p>
