      <p>People call you a con artist, but you&rsquo;re really an entertainer.
      You make people happy&mdash;the separation of fools and villains from
      their money is purely a pleasant side effect.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>What is your most common con? Selling fake magic items? Speaking to
      ghosts? Posing as a long-lost relative? Or do you let dishonest people
      think they&rsquo;re cheating you?</p>
