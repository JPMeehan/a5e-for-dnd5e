      <h2>Deep One Traits</h2>

      <p>Deep Ones are fish-folk of the deep sea known for their contact with
      alien forces.</p>

      <p><strong>Age. </strong>Deep Ones age at a similar rate as humans.
      Demigods live among the deep ones, and their scions can live for
      centuries.</p>

      <p><strong>Size. </strong>Your size is Medium.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed. </strong>You have a base walking speed and a swim speed
      of 30 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Amphibious. </strong>You can breathe both air and water.</p>

      <p><strong>Deep Darkvision. </strong>You can see in dim light within 60
      feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
      light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. In
      addition, your eyes are perfectly adapted for spotting movement at depth,
      and the radius of your darkvision increases to 120 feet while
      underwater.</p>

      <p><strong>Deep Sea Explorer. </strong>You are adapted to survive the
      environmental pressures of the deepest oceans and even the Elemental Plane
      of Water.</p>

      <p><strong>Oceanic Solidarity. </strong>You can communicate with aquatic
      Beasts. You have advantage on Charisma checks made during these
      interactions.</p>

      <h2>Deep One Gifts</h2>

      <p><strong>Telepathy. </strong>You can speak telepathically to a creature
      within 30 feet of you that you can see. Though this grants the creature no
      ability to respond telepathically, they can understand you if you share a
      language. You can speak in this way to one creature at a time.</p>

      <h2>Deep One Paragon</h2>

      <p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of the deep ones. You
      gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3>Envoy of Abundance</h3>

      <p>Water you create magically, such as through the create or destroy water
      spell, is potable. When you cast the ceremony&nbsp;spell, you have the
      additional option to revitalize 1 acre of land, restoring nutrients to it
      as though it had been left to rest for 1 year. You can use this trait to
      these spells each once between long rests without spending material
      components. Your spellcasting ability is your choice of Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>

      <h3>Darting Marlin</h3>

      <p>Your swim speed improves by 30 feet.</p>

      <h3>Guardian of the Darkest Depths</h3>

      <p>The ranges of your Deep Darkvision double.</p>
