      <p dir="ltr">Stewards, butlers, maids, governesses, custodians, and
      groundskeepers. Caretakers are people who directly care for the things
      which elite institutions and noble families value the most. Depending on
      the wealth of the family or the size of the estate, it may require the
      supervision of several custodians in specialized roles to get all the work
      done. There is a certain autonomy granted to caretakers, who are entrusted
      with taking the responsibility entirely from the hands of their employers.
      The best caretakers are hardly seen or heard at all, making them privy to
      all manner of information their employer trusts to remain
      confidential.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Did you serve a wealthy family, or did you serve an
      institution (such as a castle or private school)? Are you still beholden
      to these loyalties, or are you estranged (or even ostracized) from your
      previous role?</p>
