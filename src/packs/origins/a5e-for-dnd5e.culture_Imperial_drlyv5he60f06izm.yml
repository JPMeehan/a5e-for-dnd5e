      <p>Characters raised in the imperial culture share a variety of traits in
      common with one
      another.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Conscript.</em></strong>&nbsp;All
      subjects of the crown must register for the draft, but many go ahead and
      serve in the guard. You are proficient with light armor, spears, and light
      crossbows.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Learned
      Teachers.</em></strong>&nbsp;Those at the safe center of empires often
      have privileged access to fine teachers and the opportunity to follow
      their interests. You know about the past, at least as told by your people.
      You gain proficiency in History and one other skill of your
      choice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Local Healers</em></strong>. Citizens at
      the heart of a nation often see more healers and clerics in a year than a
      remote villager sees in a lifetime, and your medical upkeep has made you
      resilient. Whenever your hit point maximum or one of your ability scores
      would be reduced, it is reduced by half as much instead (minimum
      1).&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read,
      sign, and write Common and one other language.</p>
