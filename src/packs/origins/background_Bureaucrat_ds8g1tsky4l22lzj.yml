      <p dir="ltr">Mayors, magistrates, politicians, functionaries, and other
      civil servants. When rule of law becomes more than just a monarch&rsquo;s
      word (such as in the case of constitutional monarchies, democracies, and
      certain theocracies), the government swells in size as legal documentation
      demands a workforce of office workers&mdash;as well as elected and
      appointed officials. Given the diverse and isolated nature of politics in
      the world of fantasy, the bureaucrat might have limited influence outside
      their faction&mdash;or they might be highly coveted for their experience
      and transferable skills.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Do you consider yourself a servant of the people, or are you
      the ambitious type with your eyes on the prize of power? Are you the type
      to seek out institutional change, or do you take pride in &ldquo;minding
      your business&rdquo; and &ldquo;doing your job?&rdquo; How does one with
      your status find themselves in the adventuring life? Are you tossed into
      circumstances beyond your control, or have you lost the good graces of the
      government?&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Bureaucrat Traits</h3>

      and one other ability score.</p>

      History, Insight, or Persuasion.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Calligrapher's
      supplies</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Feature: Civil Service.</strong>&nbsp;While in a
      settlement in which you can establish a connection with the government,
      you can ply your trade as a civil servant (such as campaigning, performing
      inspections, meetings with important people, or doing office work) to earn
      yourself an income granting you a rich lifestyle. While plying your trade
      in this way, you can Gather Information simultaneously at no
      penalty.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Alternatively, when you Gather Information while not plying
      your trade in this way, you gain advantage on Persuasion, Deception, and
      Intimidation checks to draw closer to a political faction or movement.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Adventures and Advancement.&nbsp;</strong>After
      enough adventures, you become elected or appointed to a position of
      increased power. (This may be gratitude expressed by your faction, a
      restoration to your faction&rsquo;s good graces, or the reward for joining
      a new faction.) Within your Prestige Center, your Prestige Rating counts
      as 1 higher, granting you better audiences and influence. You also gain
      the service of 4 functionaries (inexperienced scribes), who are on your
      faction&rsquo;s payroll but work for you.</p>
