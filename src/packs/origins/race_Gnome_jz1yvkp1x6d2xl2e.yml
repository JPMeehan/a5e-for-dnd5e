      <h2>Gnome Traits</h2><p>Characters with gnome heritage share the following
      traits:</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Gnomes mature at about the
      same rate as humans, and are expected to settle down into adult life by
      the age of 40. They can live anywhere from 350 to nearly 500
      years.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Gnomes range from 3 to 4 feet
      tall, and weigh around 40 pounds on average. Your size is
      Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      25 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Gnomes have adapted
      to see easily in darkened conditions. You can see in dim light within 60
      feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
      light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><em><strong>Gnome Cunning.</strong></em> You gain an expertise
      die on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against
      magic.</p><p><em><strong>Gnomish Magic.</strong></em> You know the minor
      illusion cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).</p><h2>Gnome
      Gifts</h2><p>Gnomes are often overlooked, due in part to living under the
      veil of their illusion magic. Diverse gnome populations live in almost any
      territory imaginable &mdash; even in cities. Choose one of the following
      heritage gifts.</p><h3>Gnomish Agility</h3><p>Adept at avoiding the
      attacks of the &ldquo;Big Folk&rdquo;, you gain +1 to your Armor Class
      against creatures of a size category larger than your own.</p><h3>Into
      Mist</h3><p>As a bonus action, or as a reaction immediately after taking
      damage, you can turn invisible. The invisibility lasts until the end of
      your next turn, and it ends early if you attack, deal damage, cast a
      spell, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this
      feature, you must finish a short or long rest before doing so
      again.</p><h2>Gnomish Paragon</h2><p>When you reach 10th level, you are an
      exemplar of gnomekind, and you gain the following paragon
      gift.</p><h3>Cunning Reflexes</h3><p>Choose one of the following saving
      throws: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. You gain an expertise die
      when using the chosen saving throw to resist magic.</p><h2>Suggested
      Cultures</h2><p>While you can choose any culture for your gnome character,
      the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: deep gnome,
      forest gnome, forgotten folx, tinker gnome.</p>
