      Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Sleight of Hand, and either Deception or

      kit.</p><p><strong><em>Feature: Guttersnipe.</em></strong>&nbsp;When
      you&rsquo;re in a town or city, you can provide a poor lifestyle for
      yourself and your companions. Also, you know how to get anywhere in town
      without being spotted by gangs, gossips, or guard
      patrols.</p><p><strong><em>Adventures and
      Advancement.</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Street kids are among a
      settlement&rsquo;s most vulnerable people, especially in cities with
      lycanthropes, vampires, and other supernatural threats. After you help out
      a few urchins in trouble, word gets out and you&rsquo;ll be able to
      consult the street network to gather information. If you roll lower than a
      15 on an Investigation check to gather information in a city or town, your
      roll is treated as a 15.</p><h3><strong>URCHIN
