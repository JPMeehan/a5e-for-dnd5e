      <p dir="ltr">You used to be dead. Now you&rsquo;re not. Whether you have
      been brought back to life or returned as an undead, you have experienced
      the Other Side and are still around to tell the tale&mdash;if you remember
      it. You may be the product of a miracle, a tragedy, or an experiment, but
      it&rsquo;s unlikely that your existence could be called
      &ldquo;ordinary.&rdquo;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">How did you die? Who or what brought you back? How long were
      you dead? How much of the afterlife do you remember? Which afterlife were
      you sent to? Do you appreciate your existence, or does it torment you? Are
      you afraid of dying again?</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Returned Traits</h3>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Constitution
      and one other ability score.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Religion, and either
      Arcana or History.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Languages: </strong>One of your choice</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 5 gold): </strong>Funerary
      clothes</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Feature: Seen the Other Side. </strong>You have
      journeyed beyond the veil of death and saw some unusual sights on your
      journey. Creatures of death or the afterlife such as Celestials, Fiends,
      and Undead can recognize this about you at a glance and will often be more
      forthcoming and candid with you than other mortals. If one would normally
      be hostile to you, there is also a 50% chance they will be indifferent
      instead. You do not gain this benefit with creatures you or your allies
      engage in combat.</p>

      id="docs-internal-guid-29a962b5-7fff-70c1-16ab-3ac112cf6a96">Adventures
      and Advancement.</strong>&nbsp;As you adventure, you may wind up learning
      more about the relationship between life and death, and in so doing, may
      find how to attract the service of the messengers of mortality. You gain
      the free service of a raven familiar (per the find familiar spell) and 2
      swarms of ravens. When a raven swarms dies, it is replaced after a long
      rest.</p>
