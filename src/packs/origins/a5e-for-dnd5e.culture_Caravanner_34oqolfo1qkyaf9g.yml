      <p>Characters raised in the caravanner culture share a variety of traits
      in common with one another.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Caravanner.&nbsp;</em></strong>Long hauls require steady
      handling of a wagon and a good rapport with the pack animals. You are
      proficient with the Animal Handling skill and with land
      vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Long Hauler.</em></strong> Sometimes riding in a caravan
      means enduring long hours and harsh weather. You have proficiency in the
      Survival skill. In addition, you have advantage on checks made to avoid
      fatigue from a forced march.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Mobile Living.</em></strong>&nbsp;You can create a
      ramshackle version of a cart or wagon with 30 minutes of work if you have
      access to raw or reclaimed materials. Ramshackle vehicles created in this
      way function identically to their normal counterparts, except their gold
      piece value is always 0, they have half as many hit points as their normal
      counterparts, and they break and become useless if they are hit by any
      attack roll with a result of natural 20.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Trampling Charge</em></strong>. Caravanners have learned to
      bowl down obstacles in their way. When you or a mount you&rsquo;re riding
      uses the Dash action or a vehicle you&rsquo;re driving uses the Ahead Full
      action, you can move through spaces occupied by creatures with a size
      category smaller than you, or your mount, or the vehicle. Creatures moved
      through in this way must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 +
      your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save,
      creatures are knocked prone and take an amount of bludgeoning damage equal
      to your level. Creatures cannot be damaged twice from the same trampling
      charge. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a
      <span class="freelinking-link">short or long rest</span>.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong>&nbsp;You can speak, read, sign,
      and write Common and one other language.</p>
