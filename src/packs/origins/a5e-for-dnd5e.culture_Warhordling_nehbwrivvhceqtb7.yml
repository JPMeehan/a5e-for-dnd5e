      <p>Characters raised in the warhordling culture share a variety of traits
      in common with one another.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Aggressive.</em></strong>&nbsp;As a bonus action, you can
      move up to your speed towards an enemy that you can see or hear.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Menacing.</em></strong>&nbsp;You gain proficiency in
      Intimidation.</p>

      <p><strong><em>War Horde Weapon Training.</em></strong>&nbsp;Your time
      spent in the war horde trained you in the ways of warfare, particularly
      when you&rsquo;re ill-equipped. You are proficient with two martial
      weapons of your choice and with light armor. You are also able to cobble
      together functional if somewhat ramshackle weapons from whatever you have
      on hand. You can create a ramshackle version of any simple weapon (except
      crossbows) with 10 minutes of work if you have access to simple materials
      such as common household items, the rusted scraps found among
      battlefields, or the bounty of the forest. Ramshackle weapons created in
      this way function identically to their normal counterparts, except their
      gold value is always 0 and they break and become useless on a critical
      fumble.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Wartime Scrounger.</em></strong>&nbsp;Once per&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">long rest</span>, you can spend 4 hours of time
      to locate Supply&nbsp;for yourself and one other creature while traveling
      through urban environments, warzones, and battlefields.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Languages</em></strong>. You can speak, read, write, and
      sign Common and one other language.</p>
