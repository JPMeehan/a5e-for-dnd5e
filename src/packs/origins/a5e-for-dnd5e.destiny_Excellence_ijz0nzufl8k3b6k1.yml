      <p>Some are fated to be the best, the apex, the pinnacle of their craft
      that all others aspire to. Such perfection demands single-minded
      determination, unending resolve and focus, and the luck of innate talent.
      Those destined for Excellence impact the world&mdash;often at the cost of
      countless sacrifices along the way.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Source of Inspiration:
      Failure</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Every failed attempt is a
      chance for growth and each time you fall you stand up stronger. You gain
      inspiration whenever the Narrator calls for you to make an ability check,
      attack roll, or&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">saving
      throw</span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;final result of the d20 roll is a natural
      1.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Inspiration Feature: Practiced
      Edge</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;A perfected technique is often
      the difference between victory and defeat. After you roll an ability
      check, attack roll, or&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">saving
      throw</span>&nbsp;but before you know the outcome, you may spend your
      inspiration to add a +5 bonus to that roll.&nbsp;</p>
