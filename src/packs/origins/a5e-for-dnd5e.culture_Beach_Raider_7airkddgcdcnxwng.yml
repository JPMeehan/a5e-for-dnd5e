      <p dir="ltr">Coastal communities live in fear of beach raiders, for though
      their ships may appear quietly over the calm horizon, they bring ruin and
      destruction to the shores where they make landfall. Many a town has
      breakfasted peacefully only to have their buildings torched and treasures
      plundered by noon by these ocean-going marauders. Although tall-tales
      abound that such pirates are the agents of fiends or the punishment of the
      gods, for raiders themselves, the terror they bring is a matter of simple
      economics; in their view, property belongs to those who can keep it, and
      those who cannot may simply be considered temporary stewards of the
      property of others.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Yet beach raiders are more than simple plunderers. For some,
      raiding is a means of gaining the necessary wealth and prestige to
      establish themselves in their homelands, where their loved ones depend on
      what they can send back home. Others seek a new home across the waves, and
      not only have several respectable kingdoms and empires begun as the
      conquests of one or more of these fleets, but several new islands and even
      continents have first been spotted by these expert navigators.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Characters raised in the beach raider culture share a variety
      of traits in common with one another.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>High Seas Sailor.</strong> You have proficiency with
      water vehicles and navigator&rsquo;s tools, and you gain an expertise die
      on Survival checks regarding navigable bodies of water.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Notorious Terror.</strong> You are proficient in
      Intimidation, and you gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks while
      you are within the area described by your Prestige rating.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Pillage and Plunder.</strong> You double your
      Strength score when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you
      can lift, push, or drag. In addition, you know the approximate market
      value of any item you can see.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Storm the Beach.</strong> You have a swim speed equal
      to your speed. If you already have a swim speed, it instead increases by
      10 feet.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, write, and
      sign Common and one other language of your choice.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Suggested Archetypes</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">Wayfinder rangers are considered invaluable beach raiders for
      their navigational prowess, while many a captain has turned Crowned
      wielder after bonding with some plundered regalia from a foreign
      throne.</p>
