      Bearing</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Soldiers recognize their own.
      Off duty soldiers are usually willing to trade tales and gossip with you.
      On duty soldiers, while not obeying your orders, are likely to answer your
      questions and treat you respectfully on the off chance that you&rsquo;re
      an unfamiliar officer who can get them in
      trouble.</p><p><strong><em>Adventures and
      Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You will occasionally run
      into old comrades, some of whom may need favors. If you perform a few
      celebrated martial deeds your old military outfit (or a new one) is likely
      to offer you an officer&rsquo;s rank. You gain the free service of up to
      8&nbsp;guards&nbsp;. Your new commanders will occasionally give you
      objectives: you will be expected to act independently in order to achieve
      these objectives.</p><h3><strong>SOLDIER
