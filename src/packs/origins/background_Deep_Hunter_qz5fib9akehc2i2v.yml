      <p>You are skilled at hunting monsters in underground environments. You
      have spent much of your training alone in the dark, honing your senses to
      pick out the slightest sound or notice the most subtle disturbance in
      loose sand. You are relentless in your pursuit, for you know the danger
      your quarry poses.</p><p>Are you a guardian of your community, or do you
      hunt for sport? Do you work alone, or do you hire yourself out as a guide
      for bored nobles in search of excitement? What monster have you sworn to
      catch?</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Wisdom and
      one other ability score.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>
      Survival, and either Nature or Stealth.</p><p><strong>Tool
      Proficiencies:</strong> Leatherworker&rsquo;s
      tools.</p><p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 12 gold):</strong> chalk,
      traveler&rsquo;s clothes, 2 hunting traps</p><p><em><strong>Feature: Deep
      Lore.</strong></em> You&rsquo;ve spent so much time underground that you
      have a natural feel for it. You always have a sense of how deep you are
      and which direction is north, provided that you&rsquo;ve traveled in these
      regions before. You are also generally aware of the physical and political
      geography of the region (e.g., &ldquo;the old dwarf colony is this way and
      those tunnels are part of the wererat pack&rsquo;s hunting
      grounds&rdquo;). You know where relatively safe places to camp are located
      and you can usually find fresh sources of
      water.</p><p><em><strong>Adventures and Advancement:</strong></em> Once
      you&rsquo;ve collected a few trophies from your hunts, people start
      offering you money in exchange for help against the subterranean monsters
      plaguing their communities. After a few such bounties, you gain the free
      service of up to 4 scouts (or scout variants). You can ask them to
      adventure with you or dispatch them to gather information on distant
      areas.</p><h3><strong>DEEP HUNTER CONNECTIONS</strong></h3><p>1. The
      hunter that saved your life.</p><p>2. The rival hunter that pursues the
      same beast.</p><p>3. The rival hunter that took credit for your kill and
      branded you a liar.</p><p>4. The intelligent monster that mocks you every
      time it escapes your grasp.</p><p>5. The community or family that depends
      on you.</p><p>6. The city alchemist that pays well for your
      trophies.</p><p>7. A community of fey, deep gnome, or shadow elves that
      owe you their lives.</p><p>8. A monster you have befriended and sworn to
      protect.</p><p>9. The surface world ruler from whom you&rsquo;re
      hiding.</p><p>10. The monster that hunts you.</p><h3><strong>DEEP HUNTER
      MEMENTOS</strong></h3><p>1. A prized bow string, arrow, whetstone, or
      other piece of equipment that has never let you down.</p><p>2. A locket
      containing the picture of a subterranean monster&rsquo;s victim.</p><p>3.
      An astonishing assortment of unusual jerkies.</p><p>4. A scar from the
      monster that got away.</p><p>5. Clothing bedecked with a dozen grisly
      trophies.</p><p>6. A lucky coin you flip when you&rsquo;re not sure of the
      way forward.</p><p>7. The broken horn or tooth that nearly killed
      you.</p><p>8. A talking monster skull (you hear it talking,
      anyway).</p><p>9. A copper coin taken from a cavern filled with riches;
      you stumbled across the cavern while lost and have never found your way
      back.</p><p>10. A journal detailing your attempts to find a navigable
      passage to the Midnight Sea.</p>
