      <p><span lang="EN">Instead of living with your head in the clouds, you
      have come down to earth to struggle with the rest of the mortals. Your
      homeland floats far above the land. It might have been an island wedged in
      the sky by arcane forces, a forgotten kingdom sequestered in the air for
      its own protection, or even an ancient flying castle.</span></p>

      <p><span style="text-indent: 36pt; font-size: 10.5pt;">Little is known
      about your people, and skylander culture varies radically from setting to
      setting. A great many skylanders are farmers and scholars, just trying to
      live a peaceful life. Others are pirates and raiders, looking to other
      aerial (or landbound) resources to plunder. Some skylanders denounce the
      skypirate lifestyle, others embrace it as the true expression of skylander
      culture.</span></p>

      <h3><span lang="EN">Skylander Traits</span></h3>

      <p>Characters raised in the skylander culture share a variety of traits in
      common with one another.</p>

      <p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em><span
      lang="EN">Aerial Magic.</span></em></strong><span lang="EN"
      style="text-indent: 9pt; font-size: 10.5pt;"> You know the <em>mage
      hand</em> cantrip, and when you cast it the hand is invisible, replaced by
      a faintly glowing wind. You can use this trait once between long rests to
      cast one spell, chosen from <em>air wave</em>, <em>feather fall</em>, or
      <em>floating disk</em>. Once you reach 3rd level, you can do so twice
      between long rests. Your spellcasting ability for these is your choice of
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</span></p>
