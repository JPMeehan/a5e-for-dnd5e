      <p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> +1 Wisdom and one other
      ability score of your choice.</p>

      <p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Religion, and any one skill of
      your choice that the spirit has imparted to you.</p>

      <p><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice, one of which is the
      spirit&rsquo;s native language.</p>

      <p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 16 gold):</strong> 2 days worth of
      rations, bell, 5 candles, ink, ink pen, 10 sheets of paper, 5 pieces of
      chalk, traveler&rsquo;s clothes</p>

      <p><em><strong>Feature: Silent Aid.</strong></em> Being in tune with your
      spirit allows them to point out something you might have missed, if only
      for their own purposes. You gain a +2 to your choice of your passive
      Perception, Investigation, or Insight score, depending on your
      spirit&rsquo;s skills.</p>

      <p>If you banish, free, or otherwise lose your spirit, consult with the
      Narrator to choose an appropriate feature from another background.
      Alternatively, the Narrator may rule that you&rsquo;ve become a beacon for
      the supernatural and another spirit has taken up haunting you.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Adventures and Advancement.</strong></em> Whether you seek
      to violently banish the restless dead or help them to peacefully pass on,
      you will gain a reputation as a spirit-speaker. Common folk and nobility
      alike are likely to approach you for advice and aid with everything from
      hereditary curses to irritable poltergeists to speaking with a dead
      relative about a lost treasure.</p>

      <p>After you have solved several such problems, you&rsquo;ve become known
      to those who deal in certain kinds of esoteric knowledge and gain access
      to their private libraries. These vast personal collections contain
      esoteric mysteries, such as those answerable with a DC 25 Arcana, History,
      or Religion check. While using such a library your host will provide you
      and your companions a moderate or rich lifestyle, depending on their means
      and how impressed they are by your exploits.</p>
