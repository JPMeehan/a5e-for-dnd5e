      <h2>Mycelial Traits</h2><p>Characters with the mycelial heritage
      share&nbsp;a variety of traits in common with
      one<br>another.</p><p><strong>Age. </strong>Mycelials grow from spores
      and&nbsp;mature quickly. In mycelial communities, a&nbsp;sporeling is
      considered an adult by the age&nbsp;of 3. They usually live about 30
      years,&nbsp;although mycelials who form bonds with&nbsp;longer-lived
      creatures have been known to&nbsp;live as long as the creatures
      they&rsquo;re bonded&nbsp;with.</p><p><strong>Size.
      </strong>Small.</p><p><strong>Speed. </strong>30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision. </strong>You have darkvision out to
      60&nbsp;feet.</p><p><strong>Plant. </strong>You are a plant in addition to
      a&nbsp;humanoid. So long as rocks and soil are&nbsp;available, you can
      sustain yourself without&nbsp;other sources of food, although you
      still&nbsp;require water. While exploring, you&nbsp;consume 1 Supply every
      other day before&nbsp;suffering fatigue.</p><p><strong>Soft Bodied.
      </strong>You can squeeze or contort&nbsp;through spaces as if you were one
      size&nbsp;category smaller than you are.</p><p><strong>Spore Cloud.
      </strong>Mycelials naturally produce&nbsp;poisonous spores, which they can
      use to&nbsp;attack or defend themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use a bonus
      action to release a puff of poisonous spores in a 5-foot-radius area
      centered on you. The spores lightly obscure the area and linger in air or
      water for 1 minute or until dispersed&nbsp;by a strong wind or current.
      Non-plant&nbsp;creatures that enter the area for the first&nbsp;time on a
      turn or start their turn there must&nbsp;make a Constitution saving throw.
      On a&nbsp;failure, the creature takes 1d6 poison&nbsp;damage and is
      poisoned until the end of its&nbsp;next turn. The DC for this saving
      throw&nbsp;equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your&nbsp;Constitution
      modifier. The poison damage&nbsp;increases to 2d6 at 4th level, 3d6 at
      9th&nbsp;level, 4d6 at 14th level, and 5d6 at 19th&nbsp;level.</p><p>Once
      a creature has been affected&nbsp;by the spores, it is immune to this
      effect for&nbsp;24 hours. You can use this trait a number of&nbsp;times
      equal to your proficiency bonus. You&nbsp;regain any expended uses when
      you finish&nbsp;a long rest.</p><h2>Mycelial Gifts</h2><p>Choose one of
      the following heritage gifts.</p><h3>Adaptability</h3><p>You can change
      your body to survive&nbsp;various environments. You gain&nbsp;resistance
      to poison damage. In&nbsp;addition, whenever you finish a long&nbsp;rest,
      you can choose one of the<br>following
      forms:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Amphibious.</strong> You canbreathe
      underwater and gain&nbsp;a swim speed equal to your&nbsp;walking
      speed.</li><li><strong>Arboreal. </strong>You gain a climb&nbsp;speed
      equal to your walking&nbsp;speed. When you fall, you&nbsp;can use your
      reaction to float&nbsp;gently to the ground, taking&nbsp;no damage from
      the fall.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cold Adapted. </strong>You
      gain&nbsp;resistance to cold damage.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Heat Adapted.
      </strong>You gain&nbsp;resistance to fire damage.&nbsp;You remain in your
      new form until<br>you use this ability again. You can benefit from only
      one form at a time.</li></ul><h3>Overactive Enzymes</h3><p>You can release
      a splash of digestive enzymes to harm your foes. You gain the acid splash
      cantrip, which you can cast without requiring components. Your
      spellcasting ability for this cantrip is your choice of Charisma,
      Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom.</p><p>You can also use
      your&nbsp;digestive enzymes to dig. You have&nbsp;a burrowing speed of 10
      feet and can move through nonmagical earth&nbsp;and stone, but not solid
      rock. You&nbsp;don&rsquo;t leave a tunnel behind unless&nbsp;you spend
      time and effort to shore&nbsp;up the tunnel, reducing your
      burrow&nbsp;speed to 5 feet every 15 minutes.</p><h2>Mycelial
      Paragon&nbsp;</h2><p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of
      mycelial-kind. You gain the following paragon gift.</p><h3>Specialized
      Spores</h3><p>Creatures affected by your Spore Cloud no longer become
      immune to it. Additionally, once per day when you create the cloud you can
      choose one of the following
      conditions:</p><ul><li>Charmed</li><li>Confuse</li><li>Frightened</li></ul><p>While
      poisoned by your spore cloud,&nbsp;a creature is also affected by
      the&nbsp;chosen condition.&nbsp;</p><h2>Suggested
      Cultures&nbsp;</h2><p>While you can choose any culture for
      your&nbsp;mycelial character, the following cultures are&nbsp;linked
      closely with this heritage:&nbsp;meld-member,
      Underharvester,&nbsp;Underlander.</p>
