      <p>Thriving in the darkest, most remote depths, deep gnomes excel when
      working in darkened or stealth conditions. In general deep gnomes tend to
      be thin and muscular, and typically bald. They have adapted to underground
      environments and are at home in the darkness, easily blending in against
      rocks and stonework. This cultural predilection for stealth manifests
      itself in magical abilities, including the power to blind others, change
      appearance, and even conceal themselves from divination magic.</p><p>With
      precious stones common in their communities, deep gnomes place great value
      on gems and many turn their hand to jewelcraft. Other than to trade for
      their wares, their society does not welcome outsiders. As such, most find
      deep gnomes to be unfriendly and humorless; within their own kind however,
      they show kindness and compassion. Hardworking, deep gnome settlements
      tend to revolve around mining and forging. Most of these towns and
      villages are carved out of great underground caverns, and many deep gnomes
      never leave them&mdash;several have grown to the size of
      cities.</p><p>Characters raised in the deep gnome culture share a variety
      of traits in common with one another.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Superior
