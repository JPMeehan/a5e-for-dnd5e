      <p>You were raised a farmer, an occupation where the money is short and
      the work days are long. You&rsquo;ve become an adventurer, a career where
      the money is plentiful but your days&mdash;if you&rsquo;re not
      careful&mdash;may be all too short.</p>

      <p>Why did you beat your plowshare into a sword? Do you seek adventure,
      excitement, or revenge? Do you leave behind a thriving farmstead or a
      smoking ruin?</p>
