      <p>Someone or something has wronged you, and even the gods cannot shield
      them from your retribution. Your burning desire for Revenge fuels your
      plans and kindles your destiny. Was your ire sparked by a grave
      misunderstanding, a callous uncaring cruelty, or a wicked and personal
      transgression?</p>

      <hr>

      <p><strong><em>Source of Inspiration: Served
      Cold</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You draw inspiration from the
      wails of those who have wronged you. You gain inspiration whenever you
      outwit a foe without the use of Deception or Persuasion checks.</p>

      <p><em>Successfully attack a surprised opponent, lead a foe into a
      prepared trap, trick an enemy into harming themselves or greatly
      benefiting you.</em></p>

      <p><strong><em>Inspiration Feature: Cloak and
      Dagger</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You know how to avert
      suspicion when danger closes in. Whenever you or an ally you can see fail
      a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, you can use your reaction to spend
      your inspiration and undo any consequences of that failed check.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY</h4>

      <p>You fulfill your destiny of Revenge when you achieve vengeance.</p>

      <p><em>Kill, imprison, or dethrone whatever entity that you believe
      wronged you, come to terms with the focus of your wrath meaningfully and
      sate your desire for vengeance.</em></p>

      <p><strong><em>Fulfillment Feature: Retaliatory
      Reputation.</em></strong>&nbsp;It has become apparent that wronging you is
      decidedly unwise and those without a death wish instinctively fear you.
      While you are not incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to direct a
      threatening stare at any hostile creature within 20 feet of you. The
      creature must make a Wisdom&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">saving
      throw</span>&nbsp;with a DC equal to your passive Intimidation score. On a
      failure, the creature is&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">frightened</span>&nbsp;until the end of its next
      turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to your
      Retaliatory Reputation for the next 24 hours.</p>
