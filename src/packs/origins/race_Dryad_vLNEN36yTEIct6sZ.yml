      <h2>Dryad Traits</h2>

      <p>Dryads and hamadryads have much in common with spriggans. Depending on
      the campaign, they might be considered Fey or Celestial instead of
      Plant.</p>

      <p><strong>Age. </strong>Dryads can awaken from ordinary trees or bushes
      of any age. They die from old age only after several centuries.</p>

      <p><strong>Size. </strong>Some dryads are taller and mightier than humans,
      while others in their modesty slide beneath notice. Your size is your
      choice of Small or Medium.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed. </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Humanoid Plant. </strong>You have both the Humanoid and Plant
      creature types.</p>

      <p><strong>Herbaceous Camouflage. </strong>You have advantage on Stealth
      checks made in wooded areas, including forests, swamps, and the like.</p>

      <p><strong>Sturdy as Oak. </strong>Your wooden flesh and barky skin give
      you added protection. Your AC equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier, unless
      your armor provides a higher value. You can still benefit from shields as
      normal.</p>

      <p><strong>Woodland Intuition. </strong>You gain an expertise die on
      Nature, Survival, herbalism kit, and poisoner kit checks.</p>

      <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Having your ancestral origins in the
      twilight realms, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
      can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
      in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in
      darkness, only shades of gray.</p>

      <p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You gain an expertise die on saving
      throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p>

      <p><strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don&rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they
      meditate deeply, remaining conscious (the Common word for such meditation
      is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion;
      such dreams are actually mental exercises that became reflexive through
      years of practice. When you take a long rest, you spend 4 hours in your
      trance state (instead of sleeping for 6 hours). During the trance you
      suffer no penalty to passive Perception. A long rest remains 8 hours for
      you as normal, and the remainder of the time must be filled only with
      light activity.</p>

      <h2>Dryad Paragon</h2>

      <p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar among the speaking
      trees, and you gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3>Elder Oak Fortitude</h3>

      <p>Your Sturdy as Oak AC equals 12 + your Constitution modifier + your
      Dexterity modifier.</p>

      <h3>Timberland Orator</h3>

      <p>You can cast speak with plants at will. Your spellcasting ability for
      this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>
