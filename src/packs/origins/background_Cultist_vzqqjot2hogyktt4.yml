      <p>You were a member of a sinister cult. You performed ancient rites found
      in forbidden tomes, seeking to empower a fiend, a false god, or a terrible
      being from a strange and distant realm.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Why did you leave the cult? Did you come to recognize the emptiness of
      its promises of power? Did you witness horrors that shook your faith? Or
      do you still nurture its dark edicts in your heart?</p>

      effect an apotheosis, or otherwise cause catastrophe. Eventually you may

      worshiped.</p>
