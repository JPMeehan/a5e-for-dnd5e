      <p>You were a member of a sinister cult. You performed ancient rites found
      in forbidden tomes, seeking to empower a fiend, a false god, or a terrible
      being from a strange and distant realm.&nbsp;</p><p>Why did you leave the
      cult? Did you come to recognize the emptiness of its promises of power?
      Did you witness horrors that shook your faith? Or do you still nurture its
      dark edicts in your heart?</p><hr><p><strong>Ability Score
      Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Intelligence and one other ability
      score.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:&nbsp;</strong>Religion, and

      Lore</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>When you fail an Arcana or
      Religion check, you know what being or book holds the knowledge you
      seek&mdash;finding the book or paying the being&rsquo;s price is another
      matter.</p><p><strong><em>Adventures and
      Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Members of your former
      order may be hunting you for reenlistment, punishment, or
      both.</p><p>Additionally, your cult still seeks to open a portal, effect
      an apotheosis, or otherwise cause catastrophe. Eventually you may have to
      face the leader of your cult and perhaps even the being you once
      worshiped.</p><h3><strong>CULTIST CONNECTIONS</strong></h3><ol><li>The
      cult leader whom you left for dead.</li><li>The cleric or herald who

      but whose cruel voice you would recognize
      anywhere.</li></ol><hr><h3><strong>CULTIST
      MEMENTOS</strong></h3><ol><li>The sinister tattoo which occasionally
      speaks to you.</li><li>The cursed holy symbol which appears in your
