      <p>Characters raised in the cosmopolitan culture share a variety of traits
      in common with one another.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Discreetly Armed.&nbsp;</em></strong>Even while armed, you
      know how to keep the fact discreet and nonthreatening. You gain
      an&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">expertise die</span>&nbsp;on checks
      made to persuade others to let you remain armed or to conceal weapons or
      items about your person.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Fashion Sense.&nbsp;</em></strong>You know how to read
      people through their clothes and bearing. After you spend at least 1
      minute observing a creature within 60 feet, you can use an action to make
      either an Insight or History check against a DC equal to the
      creature&rsquo;s passive Deception check score. On a success, you learn
      the following information about that creature:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Whether the creature has a lower Charisma score than yourself.</li>

      <li>The creature&rsquo;s culture and national origin (if any).</li>

      <li>The creature&rsquo;s social standing in the local majority
      culture.&nbsp;</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong><em>Skill Versatility.&nbsp;</em></strong>In the big city, you
      never know what skills you&rsquo;ll need to get by. You gain proficiency
      in Culture and one other skill of your choice.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Urban Denizen.</em></strong>&nbsp;You know your way around
      big cities, and know how to find people in urban locations. You can make
      an Investigation check to learn the location of (or at the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion gain a helpful clue to the trail of) a person
      by discreetly asking around in the right places. The difficulty of the
      check is DC 15 if the individual is not hiding, or DC 20 if they are
      trying to conceal their location.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Well-Connected.</em></strong>&nbsp;You gain an extra
      connection, selected from a background of your choice. This person is of a
      different heritage or national origin than yourself.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Languages.&nbsp;</em></strong>You can speak, read, write,
      and sign in Common and two additional languages.</p>
