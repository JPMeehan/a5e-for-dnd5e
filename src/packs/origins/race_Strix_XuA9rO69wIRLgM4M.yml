      <h2>Strix Traits</h2>

      <p>Strix are owlfolk who are quite hardy in spite of their avian
      nature.</p>

      <p><strong>Age. </strong>Strix reach full maturity well before 8 years.
      Few live longer than half a century.</p>

      <p><strong>Size. </strong>Strix prefer to crouch and it is hard to state
      their average upright height; body length varies from 4 to 7 feet. Their
      build is even more slender than elves, but their feathers frequently make
      them look more robust. Your size is Medium.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed. </strong>You have a base walking speed of 25 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Mighty Wings. </strong>You have a fly speed of 50 feet. To use
      this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor, nor can you
      be encumbered (if using variant encumbrance). Because of your large wing
      span, while flying you occupy the the space of a Huge-sized creature (15
      feet wide). You cannot squeeze through smaller spaces while flying. Due to
      being a larger target, when you fly, attack rolls against you have
      advantage until the start of your next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Aided Leap. </strong>Even when you cannot use your wings to
      fly, you can use them to aid you in your jumps. As long as you are not
      wearing medium or heavy armor, and are not encumbered (if using variant
      encumbrance), you may determine your jump distance with your Dexterity,
      your jumps count as having made a running start, and your jump distance is
      doubled.</p>

      <p><strong>Aided Fall. </strong>Your wings also slow your fall. When you
      fall, unless you choose not to, your wings slow your fall to a speed of
      150 feet per round; at this speed, you have resistance to damage from
      falling. You can slow your fall speed even further as a reaction, to a
      fall rate of 60 feet per round; at this speed, you take no damage from
      falling.</p>

      <p><strong>Claws. </strong>The claws on your feet are natural weapons,
      which you can use to make unarmed strikes dealing 1d4 slashing damage.
      They have the finesse property.</p>

      <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Your strix blood grants you superior
      vision in dark or dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet
      of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
      light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>

      <p><strong>Heavy Lifter.</strong> When determining your carrying capacity
      and the weight that you can push, drag, or lift, your size is considered
      to be Large.</p>

      <p>Note: A creature can only be considered a maximum of one size larger or
      smaller when determining how much Supply and weight it can carry.</p>

      <p><strong>Mighty Attacks.</strong> When you score a critical hit with a
      melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon&rsquo;s damage dice an
      additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>

      <h2>Strix Paragon</h2>

      <p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of the strix. You gain
      one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3>Acrobatic Aerialist</h3>

      <p>Even with your wingspan, you can flutter through tight spaces, ignoring
      the 15 foot space requirement of your Mighty Wings. While airborne, if you
      are subject to an attack, you use your reaction to remove the advantage
      you grant on that attack.</p>

      <h3>Aerial Dreadnought</h3>

      <p>Medium armor, heavy armor, and encumbrance do not prevent your use of
      Mighty Wings or Aided Leap.</p>

      <h3>Natural Aeromancy</h3>

      <p>Choose two spell schools from the following: air, lighting, storm,
      senses, weather. All spells of the schools you chose are added to your
      class spell list for you.</p>
