      <p>It is a curious phenomenon that the brutal desert can be such fertile
      ground for faith. These arid lands have produced many&nbsp;theocratic
      civilizations&mdash;so-called "desert hierarchies." The diversity of these
      cultures is hard to overstate, and in a campaign centered in arid lands,
      it would be worthwhile to examine each such culture in fine
      detail.</p><p>Generally, a desert hierarchy has three things to consider:
      the people, the resources, and the faith. Who are the priests in this
      society, and how much power do they wield? How do they defend their
      people, their resources, and their faith from outside interference? In
      some lands, the priests of the gods help all the people access nature's
      bounty; in others, only the faithful are permitted to eat while the
      dissenters starve. Some hierarchies organize the people to make grand
      stone edifices to the gods; some hierarchies buckle under their own weight
      and the gods scatter them to the sands.</p><p>There was once a desert
      hierarchy dominated by a tabaxi priesthood. They were unified by a tabaxi
      pharaoh, and when a pharaonic line eventually died out the priesthood
      would &ldquo;have the gods&rdquo; appoint a new one. They worshiped feline
      gods, and communed with the sphinxes. All that remains of that culture are
      its remarkable ruins and the isolated enclaves who worship a king they
      call &ldquo;the true pharaoh.&rdquo;</p><h3>Desert Hierarch
      Traits</h3><p>Characters raised in a desert hierarch culture share a
      variety of traits in common with one another.</p><p><strong>Dune
      Strider.</strong> You ignore difficult terrain caused by sand and loose
      soil.</p><p><strong>Religious Education.</strong> You are proficient in
      the Religion skill and know one cantrip of your choice from the cleric,
      druid, or herald spell list. Your spellcasting ability score for this
      cantrip is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is
      highest).</p><p><strong>Subject of the Sun.</strong> You are acclimated to
      extreme desert heats. Heat which does not cause you damage does not harm
      you or inflict fatigue or strife so long as you are not wearing heavy
      armor or carrying a heavy load.</p><p>You also have resistance to radiant
      damage.</p><p><strong>Protector of Provisions.</strong> Your care of
      sparse resources kicks in when plans go awry. When you are subject to
      Supply loss, you can declare any of the lost Supply as being your
      protected provisions, conserving it. Each week, you can declare a maximum
      number of protected provisions equal to your proficiency bonus + your
      choice of Intelligence or Wisdom
      modifier.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, write,
      and sign Common, plus one other language.</p>
