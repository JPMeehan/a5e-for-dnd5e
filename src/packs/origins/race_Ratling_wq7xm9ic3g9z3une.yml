      live as long as 60&nbsp;years.</p><p><strong>Size.
      </strong>Small.</p><p><strong>Speed. </strong>30

      that rely on smell.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Poison Tolerance. </strong>You are
      immune to&nbsp;ingested poison.</p><h2>Ratling Gifts</h2><p>In addition to
      the traits found in your ratling&nbsp;heritage, select one of the
      following gifts.</p><h3>Bottomless Appetite</h3><p>Your appetite is
      insatiable. Although you enjoy fine cuisine as much as&nbsp;anyone else,
      you can also eat foods&nbsp;that others can&rsquo;t stomach.
      Even&nbsp;when you&rsquo;re at death&rsquo;s door, food&nbsp;restores your
      strength and vitality.&nbsp;Grab a Quick Bite. You can eat and&nbsp;digest
      huge quantities of food in&nbsp;seconds. If you have sufficient
      food&nbsp;for one day (1 Supply), you can eat it&nbsp;as an action. When
      you do so, you&nbsp;gain temporary hit points equal to&nbsp;twice your
      proficiency bonus. You&nbsp;can use this trait a number of
      times&nbsp;equal to your proficiency bonus. You&nbsp;regain any expended
      uses when you&nbsp;finish a long rest.</p><h3>Strength in
      Numbers</h3><p>You are adept at working in a team. Whether in combat or in
      other pursuits, you are quick to exploit any&nbsp;advantage your
      companions create.&nbsp;</p><p>Group Tactics. You can make an ability
      check with advantage as part of a group check. Once you use
      this&nbsp;trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve
      taken a short or long rest.&nbsp;</p><p>Rat Swarm. Once on your turn, you
      can reroll an attack roll against a target within 30 feet if another
      creature has made a melee attack against the same target since the end of
      your last turn. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus. You regain&nbsp;any expended uses when you
      finish&nbsp;a long rest.</p><h2>Ratling Paragon</h2><p>When you reach 10th
      level, you gain the&nbsp;following paragon gift. When you make
      a&nbsp;saving throw that you are not proficient in,&nbsp;you can add an
      expertise die to the save.</p><h3>Lucky Escape</h3><p>You are adept at
      avoiding the negative&nbsp;consequences of others&rsquo; hostility and
      your&nbsp;own unwise actions. Whenever you make a&nbsp;saving throw you
      are not proficient in, you&nbsp;gain a bonus to the roll equal to half
      your&nbsp;proficiency bonus (rounded down).&nbsp;</p><h2>Suggested
      Cultures</h2><p>While you can choose any culture for your&nbsp;ratling
      character, the following cultures are&nbsp;linked closely with this
      heritage: circusfolk,&nbsp;cosmopolitan, mischief maker, sewer rat.</p>
