      <h2>Winged Elf Traits</h2>

      <p>Winged Elves are elves whose line intermingled with air elementals.</p>

      <p><strong>Age.</strong> Elf children mature at the same rate as human
      children, but elvish cultures do not consider them to be fully mentally
      developed (nor matured) until they acquire a century of life experience.
      Elves today can live to be 700 or older, and legends speak of elves who
      simply never die.</p>

      <p><strong>Size.</strong> Elves have a slender and graceful build. Some
      stand as tall as average humans, although most are a head or so shorter.
      Your size is Medium.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Having your ancestral origins in the
      twilight realms, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
      can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
      in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in
      darkness, only shades of gray.</p>

      <p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You gain an expertise die on saving
      throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p>

      <p><strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don&rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they
      meditate deeply, remaining conscious (the Common word for such meditation
      is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion;
      such dreams are actually mental exercises that became reflexive through
      years of practice. When you take a long rest, you spend 4 hours in your
      trance state (instead of sleeping for 6 hours). During the trance you
      suffer no penalty to passive Perception. A long rest remains 8 hours for
      you as normal, and the remainder of the time must be filled only with
      light activity.</p>

      <p><strong>Mighty Wings. </strong>You have a fly speed of 50 feet. To use
      this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor, nor can you
      be encumbered (if using variant encumbrance). Because of your large wing
      span, while flying you occupy the the space of a Huge-sized creature (15
      feet wide). You cannot squeeze through smaller spaces while flying. Due to
      being a larger target, when you fly, attack rolls against you have
      advantage until the start of your next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Aided Leap. </strong>Even when you cannot use your wings to
      fly, you can use them to aid you in your jumps. As long as you are not
      wearing medium or heavy armor, and are not encumbered (if using variant
      encumbrance), you may determine your jump distance with your Dexterity,
      your jumps count as having made a running start, and your jump distance is
      doubled.</p>

      <p><strong>Aided Fall. </strong>Your wings also slow your fall. When you
      fall, unless you choose not to, your wings slow your fall to a speed of
      150 feet per round; at this speed, you have resistance to damage from
      falling. You can slow your fall speed even further as a reaction, to a
      fall rate of 60 feet per round; at this speed, you take no damage from
      falling.</p>

      <h2>Winged Elven Paragon</h2>

      <p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of elfkind, and you gain
      one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3>Elfsight</h3>

      <p>Nature cannot block the legendary accuracy of your people. Your attack
      rolls ignore half cover, and an area being lightly obscured does not
      impose disadvantage on your ability checks. You do not have disadvantage
      from making ranged attacks at long range.</p>

      <h3>Inexorable Darkvision</h3>

      <p>There is no range limit for your darkvision.</p>

      <h3>Spiritual Awareness</h3>

      <p>You are able to cast detect thoughts a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus between each long rest. Your spellcasting ability for
      this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is
      highest).</p>
