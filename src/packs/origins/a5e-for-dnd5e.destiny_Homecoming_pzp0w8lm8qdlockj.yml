      <p dir="ltr">Wherever you are now, you know it&rsquo;s not where
      you&rsquo;re truly meant to be. For some with the Homecoming destiny,
      their home is a distant memory they strive to return to. For others, home
      is a future hope: a place they know in their heart of hearts exists, even
      though they&rsquo;ve never been there. For all, however, home is a place
      they know they will someday reach, no matter how long the journey
      takes.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Source of Inspiration</h3>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Press On.</strong> You draw comfort from the thought
      of home, even when it&rsquo;s hard to endure. You gain inspiration
      whenever you forgo a comfort or accept a significant hardship in order to
      better advance your journey.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Willingly partake in a forced march, leave behind someone
      you&rsquo;ve grown close to, take a shortcut through a perilous
      region.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Inspiration Feature</h3>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Homeward Bound.</strong> Something inside you calls
      you on, directing you as to the best path to take. You may spend your
      inspiration to select a location whose existence you are aware of. The
      Narrator provides you with a substantial hint or bonus that will allow you
      to reach that destination or overcome obstacles in your way. Often, this
      will take the form of a Boon or Discovery or an automatic success on a
      journey activity (regardless of the initial roll). Likewise, you may also
      spend inspiration to automatically succeed against the maze spell.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Fulfilling Your Destiny</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">You fulfill your destiny of Homecoming when you finally
      arrive where you were always meant to be.</p>

      <blockquote>

      <p dir="ltr">Reunite with loved ones after a journey of many years,
      discover the hidden truth about your origins, be accepted back among your
      people as one of their own.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Fulfillment Feature: </strong>Home Is Where The Heart
      Is. Having finally returned home, you can never truly be separated from it
      again, even if your adventures continue. You are always considered to be
      in a haven when taking a long rest, and any feature or effect that would
      reduce your fatigue or strife reduces it by twice as much. In addition,
      once per week, you and your party may gain the benefits of a long rest by
      taking a short rest. Although a creature cannot benefit from this improved
      rest more than once per week, this feature does not count against how
      often a creature may benefit from the improved rest granted by a Grade 2
      house stronghold, nor vice versa.</p>
