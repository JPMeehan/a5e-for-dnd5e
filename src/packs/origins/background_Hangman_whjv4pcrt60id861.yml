      <p>You made your living ending the lives of others. Depending&nbsp;on your
      society, these executions may have been swift and&nbsp;merciful, lingering
      and cruel, or a mix of the two. They may&nbsp;have also been private or
      public. In either case, you have&nbsp;killed more people than almost any
      soldier, and have an&nbsp;intimate familiarity with death and suffering
      that most hope&nbsp;they never acquire.&nbsp;</p><p>Did you relish your
      work, or was it simply a job? Were you merciful or cruel? Were you
      efficient or sloppy? Did you put on a show for the crowd? Did you
      sympathize with the condemned or despise them? Were you well-compensated,
      or did you struggle?</p><hr><p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>
