      <p dir="ltr">Law is the public ritual (or some would say cosmological
      force) which demands the respect of commoner and king alike. This makes
      the rule of law a kind of magic, and the wielders of this magic are
      lawyers. From presenting legal arguments in courts, presiding over courts
      as judges, to drafting groundbreaking legislation&mdash;lawyers are
      indispensable allies when advancing your cause in the eyes of the
      law.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">As a lawyer, do you have a particular subject expertise, like
      trade law or royal succession? Are you an attorney who defends and
      prosecutes in the courts, one who drafts injunctions and policies, or do
      you simply provide private counsel?</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Lawyer Traits</h3>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Intelligence
      and one other ability score.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Culture, and either
      History, Insight, or Persuasion.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Bonus Specialty: </strong>Laws (per Culture), which
      does not count against your normal specialty total.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Language Proficiencies:</strong> Any one of your
      choice</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 55 gold): </strong>Book
      (blank), fine clothes, 1 oz. jar of ink, ink pen, signet ring</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Feature: Emergency Injunction.&nbsp;</strong>While in
      a settlement in which you can communicate with officers of the law, you
      can spend 1 hour to file an emergency injunction. This injunction compels
      a specific person to complete or cease a certain action in consistency
      with the law&mdash;such as &ldquo;stay away from my horse&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;get your horses out of my stable.&rdquo; The injunction is a legal
      order which will be enforced by the town guard, and it is considered law
      for one week after which time the emergency injunction wares out and it
      must be restored through the normal bureaucratic means. Alternatively, you
      might instead file paperwork formally accusing a person of a crime or
      granting someone you know bail without payment. You can file no more than
      1 emergency injunction per week.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Adventures and Advancement.</strong>&nbsp;After
      enough adventures, you are promoted to a legal role of profound power: a
      high judge, a district prosecuting or defense attorney, or the personal
      counsel of someone famous. You acquire a yearly retainer fee, which allows
      you to afford an estate (Grade 2 luxurious house) and live a rich
      lifestyle. Additionally, you can use your Emergency Injunction once
      between long rests instead of once per week.</p>
