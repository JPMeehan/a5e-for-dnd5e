      <p><em><strong>Source of Inspiration: War of Attrition.</strong></em> You
      gain Inspiration whenever you strike a blow against an especially powerful
      creature related to your destiny (but not necessarily your specific
      destined foe).</p><p><em>Force the powerful enemy&rsquo;s retreat, obtain
      an item important to their defeat, gain a significant insight into their
      location or intentions, defeat one of their trusted
      lieutenants.</em></p><p><em><strong>Inspiration Feature: Slayer&rsquo;s
      Gift.</strong></em> Fighting the creatures of darkness hones both your
      mental and physical prowess. After you roll an ability check, attack roll,
      or saving throw but before you know the outcome, you may spend your
      inspiration to add a +5 bonus to that roll.</p><h4>FULFILLING YOUR
      DESTINY</h4><p>You fulfill your destiny as a Slayer when you defeat a
      specific and powerful creature connected to your fate.</p><p><em>Destroy
      Vashika, Queen of the Vampires, thwart the aboleth Birgamoz&rsquo;s
      terrible plans of domination, imprison the Dread Knight Maza
      Dunn.</em></p><p><strong><em>Fulfillment Feature: Eyes of the Slayer.
      </em></strong>While you are not incapacitated, you can use a bonus action
      to fix any hostile creature within 20 feet of you with an unsettling look,
      seeming to stare into its very soul. The creature makes a Wisdom saving
      throw with a DC equal to your passive Intimidation score. On a failure, it
      is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it is immune
      to this ability for 24 hours.</p>
