      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to
      Constitution and one other ability score.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Athletics,
      and either Acrobatics or Perception.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Tool
      Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Navigator&rsquo;s tools, water vehicles.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 27
      gold):&nbsp;</strong>Common clothes, navigator&rsquo;s tools, 50 feet of
      rope.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong><em>Feature: Sea Salt.</em></strong>&nbsp;Your
      nautical jargon and rolling gait mark you unmistakably as a mariner. You
      can easily enter into shop talk with any sailors that are not hostile to
      you, learning nautical gossip and ships&rsquo; comings and goings. You
      also recognize most large ships by sight and by name, and can make a
      History or&nbsp;Culture&nbsp;check to recall their most recent captain and
      allegiance.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong><em>Adventures and
      Advancement.</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You and your companions
      will be able to take passage for free on nearly any commercial ship in
      exchange for occasional ship duties when all hands are called. In
      addition, after you have a few naval exploits under your belt your fame
      makes sailors eager to sail under you. You can hire a ship&rsquo;s crew at
      half the usual price.</p>
