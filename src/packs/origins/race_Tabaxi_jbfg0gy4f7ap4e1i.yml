      <h2>Tabaxi Traits</h2>

      <p>Characters with the tabaxi heritage share a variety of traits in common
      with one another.</p>

      <p><strong>Age. </strong>Tabaxi age at the same rate as humans.</p>

      <p><strong>Size. </strong>Most tabaxi have the same height and
      weight&nbsp;ranges as humans, although some tribes frequently reach 7 feet
      tall, and others can be stocky as dwarves. Your size is Medium.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed. </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Darkvision. </strong>Your feline anatomy grants you superior
      vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet
      of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
      light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>

      <p><strong>Natural Hunter.</strong> You gain proficiency with either
      Perception, Stealth, or Survival.</p>

      <p><strong>Claws. </strong>The claws on your hands and feet are natural
      weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes dealing 1d4 slashing
      damage. They have the dual-wielding and finesse properties.</p>

      <h2>Tabaxi Gifts</h2>

      <p>In addition to the traits found in your tabaxi heritage, select one of
      the following gifts.</p>

      <h3>Dense Fur</h3>

      <p>Your coat is naturally thick, granting you both physical protection and
      resistance to the cold. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Winter Coat. </strong>You gain resistance to cold damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Guard Fur. </strong>Your dense fur includes both a soft inner
      layer and a coarse, protective outer layer. Your AC equals 12 + your
      Dexterity modifier, unless your armor provides a higher value. You can
      still benefit from shields as normal</p>

      <h3>Feline Fury</h3>

      <p>Whether backed into a corner or toying with a wounded foe, never forget
      that cats aren&rsquo;t truly tame. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Feline Fury. </strong>When you or your intended target are
      bloodied, your melee weapon attacks deal bonus damage equal to your
      proficiency bonus. However, the sting of your fury lessens after the first
      blow, so after you deal this extra damage to a creature, this trait cannot
      deal extra damage to it during the same combat.</p>

      <h3>Mighty Roar</h3>

      <p>Channeling your strength and pride, you can drive away&nbsp;enemies
      with a mighty roar. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Mighty Roar. </strong>You can unleash your mighty roar as a
      bonus action. Enemy creatures who can hear you within 10 feet must make a
      Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + either your
      Constitution or Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you for 1
      minute. Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by it
      for 24 hours. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until
      you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h3>Zoomies</h3>

      <p>A shiver crawls up your spine&mdash;run! You gain the following
      benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Alacrity. </strong>Your walking speed increases by 5 feet so
      long as you are not carrying a heavy load or wearing heavy armor</p>

      <p><strong>Climbing Claws. </strong>You get a Climb speed of 20 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Zoom. </strong>You can use this trait to Dash without spending
      an action. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until after
      you move 0 feet on your own turn.</p>

      <h2>Tabaxi Paragon</h2>

      <p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of catkind, and you gain
      one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3>Feline Freefaller</h3>

      <p>If you are not carrying a heavy load or wearing heavy armor, you are
      immune to falling damage. When you fall and take no damage, you land on
      your feet.</p>

      <h3>Improved Claws</h3>

      <p>The damage of your claws increases to 1d6. When you attack with your
      claws and both your hands are otherwise free, your claws&rsquo; damage
      further increases to 1d8.</p>

      <h3>Wall-Clinger</h3>

      <p>You have a Climb speed equal to your walking speed. You can walk on
      walls and upside down on ceilings.</p>

      <h2>Tabaxi Culture</h2>

      <p>As people, most tabaxi are fiercely independent. Even communally-minded
      tabaxi understand that what makes their society powerful isn&rsquo;t
      homogeneity&mdash;it is the strength of each individual as they stand in
      solidarity. Less communitarian tabaxi adore freedom and
      self-expression&mdash;and sometimes privilege their own to the neglect of
      others. <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">This causes an overall ingrained
      culture tabaxi find hard to shake: following your instincts; pleasure,
      strength, and genius are what make life precious.</span></p>

      <p>There are two main groups of tabaxi cultures: traditional and diaspora.
      Traditional tabaxi cultures are the historical seats of power for tabaxi
      civilization. There have been at least four significant tabaxi kingdoms of
      consequence, with locations varying from jungle, desert, coastline, and
      even icy mountains. The present state of traditional tabaxi cultures
      varies by setting, but even fallen tabaxi kingdoms may still exhibit
      isolated city-states who practice the old&nbsp;ways.</p>

      <p>Tumult within traditional tabaxi cultures has pushed them into a global
      diaspora, aided both for good and ill by contact with outside cultures.
      Some tabaxi love the sense of adventure, freedom, and authenticity of the
      diaspora lifestyle&mdash;they make some of the best adventurers. Other
      tabaxi are embittered by their displacement from their ancestral homelands
      and the violence they experience at the hands of others&mdash;they make
      some of the best revolutionaries and villains.</p>

      <h3>Suggested Cultures</h3>

      <p>While you can choose any culture for your tabaxi character, the
      following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: desert hierarch,
      forsaken, hoplite legionnaire, plus the variants below.</p>

      <h3>Tabaxi Variant Cultures</h3>

      <p>Some tabaxi diaspora communities strongly resemble cultures already
      described in the main rulebook. When you choose that culture, you can make
      the following changes.</p>

      <p>The Itinerant culture strongly resembles the general tabaxi community
      in diaspora. You Blend In by hiding your scent with herbs; change
      proficiency with disguise kit to herbalism kit. Choose Tabaxi as one of
      your languages.</p>

      <p>The Forgotten Folx culture strongly resembles diaspora tabaxi enclaves
      oriented round communal living and child-rearing. Replace Gnomish language
      proficiency with Tabaxi.</p>

      <p>The Wood Elf culture strongly resembles the traditional jungle-dwelling
      tabaxi culture. Replace Wood Elf Weapon Training with proficiency in
      Stealth. Replace Elvish language proficiency with Tabaxi.</p>
