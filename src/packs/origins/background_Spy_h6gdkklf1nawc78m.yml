      <p dir="ltr">You are a covert operative. Spies serve in a wide variety of
      circumstances and use whatever means are most expedient to acquire
      intelligence while remaining undetected. You might be the product of an
      elite program that produces world-class espionage operatives, or you could
      be a self-trained member of an extensive grass-roots resistance
      movement.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Spies vary in terms of employer, social location, method, and
      training. Are you part of an organization, or a freelancer? Do you follow
      a cause or work for money? How did you come by your skills, and who, if
      anyone, taught you? What social circles do you run in to get the
      information you seek?&nbsp;</p>

      ignore you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
