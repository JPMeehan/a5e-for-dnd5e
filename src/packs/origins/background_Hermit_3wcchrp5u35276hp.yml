      Voice</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You occasionally hear a
      voice&mdash;perhaps your conscience, perhaps a higher power&mdash;which
      you have come to trust. It told you to go into seclusion, and then it
      advised you when to rejoin the world. You think it is leading you to your
      destiny (consult with your Narrator about this feature.)</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong><em>Adventures and
      Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Your inner voice may
      occasionally prompt you to accept certain adventure opportunities or to
      avoid certain actions. You are free to obey or disobey this voice.
      Eventually however it may lead you to a special revelation, adventure, or
      treasure.</p>
