      <p>Those destined for Chaos don&rsquo;t live by the rules binding ordinary
      folk. They clash with authority and tradition all their lives, either in
      minor acts of subversion or outright rebellion. Tricksters are rarely mere
      rulebreakers&mdash;their ideology signals change for both the meek and
      mighty.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong><em>Source of Inspiration:
      Chaos</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You sow disorder, play tricks,
      and subvert tradition. You gain inspiration whenever you successfully
      subvert law and order, so long as it benefits your allies or moves the
      story forward.</p><p><em>Successfully lie to or humiliate an authority
      figure, commit a punishable crime, indulge in base pleasures to
      ill-advised extremes.</em></p><p><strong><em>Inspiration Feature:
      Ingenious Doubletalk</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Undaunted by
      momentary setbacks, you twist conversations in any direction with an
      inspired turn of phrase and confusing doubletalk that plays off bold lies
      and impertinent proposals as jokes, obfuscates or redirects accidentally
      slipped information, or quells outrage with diffusing flattery. Whenever
      you or a friendly creature you can hear fails a Deception or a Persuasion
      check, you can use your reaction to spend your inspiration and undo any
      consequences of that failed check.</p><hr><h4>FULFILLING YOUR
      DESTINY</h4><p>You fulfill your destiny of Chaos when you overturn a world
      or cosmic order.</p><p><em>Greatly destabilize a nation or extremely large
      organization, subvert or trick a deity-level entity, upset the status quo
      for a vast number of people.</em></p><p><strong><em>Fulfillment Feature:
      Agent of Chaos.</em></strong>&nbsp;The whims of chaos flow through you and
      everything you do. Whenever you roll one or more dice to determine the
      damage of an attack or spell or the random effects of a spell or feature,
      you may choose to reroll those dice; if you do you must use the new
      rolls.</p><p>In addition, you gain the Chaotic alignment and emit a strong
      chaotic aura for the purposes of any feature, spell, or trait that detects
      or affects Chaotic creatures.</p><hr><p><strong>Table: Chaos

      orders is akin to slavery.</p><p>2&nbsp;<em>Excitement:</em>&nbsp;A day of

      and you plan on cheating.</p><p>4&nbsp;<em>Fun:</em>&nbsp;Life is for
      living and living well.</p><p>5&nbsp;<em>Liberation:</em>&nbsp;Everyone
      should be free to choose their own
