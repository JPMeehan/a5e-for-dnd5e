      <h2>Aquatic Elf Traits</h2>

      <p>Aquatic elves have much in common with merfolk, even culturally.</p>

      <p><strong>Age. </strong>Aquatic elves age at a similar rate as humans.
      Demigods live among the aquatic elves, and their scions can live for
      centuries.</p>

      <p><strong>Size. </strong>Your size is Medium.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed. </strong>You have a base walking speed and a swim speed
      of 30 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Amphibious. </strong>You can breathe both air and water.</p>

      <p><strong>Deep Darkvision. </strong>You can see in dim light within 60
      feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
      light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. In
      addition, your eyes are perfectly adapted for spotting movement at depth,
      and the radius of your darkvision increases to 120 feet while
      underwater.</p>

      <p><strong>Deep Sea Explorer. </strong>You are adapted to survive the
      environmental pressures of the deepest oceans and even the Elemental Plane
      of Water.</p>

      <p><strong>Oceanic Solidarity. </strong>You can communicate with aquatic
      Beasts. You have advantage on Charisma checks made during these
      interactions.</p>

      <p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You gain an expertise die on saving
      throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p>

      <p><strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don&rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they
      meditate deeply, remaining conscious (the Common word for such meditation
      is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion;
      such dreams are actually mental exercises that became reflexive through
      years of practice. When you take a long rest, you spend 4 hours in your
      trance state (instead of sleeping for 6 hours). During the trance you
      suffer no penalty to passive Perception. A long rest remains 8 hours for
      you as normal, and the remainder of the time must be filled only with
      light activity.</p>

      <h2>Merfolk Paragon</h2>

      <p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of the elvenfolk. You
      gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>

      <h3>Envoy of Abundance</h3>

      <p>Water you create magically, such as through the create or destroy water
      spell, is potable. When you cast the ceremony&nbsp;spell, you have the
      additional option to revitalize 1 acre of land, restoring nutrients to it
      as though it had been left to rest for 1 year. You can use this trait to
      these spells each once between long rests without spending material
      components. Your spellcasting ability is your choice of Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>

      <h3>Darting Marlin</h3>

      <p>Your swim speed improves by 30 feet.</p>

      <h3>Guardian of the Darkest Depths</h3>

      <p>The ranges of your Deep Darkvision double.</p>
