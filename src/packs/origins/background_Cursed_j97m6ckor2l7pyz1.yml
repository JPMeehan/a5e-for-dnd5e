      clothes</p><p><em><strong>Feature: Accursed.</strong></em> Whenever you
      fail at a Deception or Persuasion check, your curse manifests in a manner
      that you work out with your Narrator ahead of time. The failed check is
      ignored, and you immediately roll an Intimidation check with which you
      have expertise, taking the new roll. However, even a successful
      Intimidation check does not necessarily produce the result you originally
      intended, as the creatures around you may recoil in fear and distrust. At
      the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may keep the expertise die to
      Intimidation until the end of the scene.</p><p><em><strong>Adventures and
      Advancement.</strong></em> The entity responsible for your curse may press
      you to complete specific tasks, such as transporting a mysterious item,
      defeating a hated enemy, or stealing important documents. Work with your
      Narrator to determine how your curse is leveraged in these situations.
      After you complete several such tasks, your infamy grows. You are known by
      all people within 100 miles of your Prestige Center, many of whom hold you
      in fearful respect. You and your companions are given a moderate lifestyle
      in settlements within this area by those who dare not risk your curse.</p>
