      <p>You were trained as a servant of a particular god or gods. Whether or
      not you have access to divine magic, you are authorized to perform the
      rites of your faith, and you are recognized and respected by its
      faithful.</p>

      <p>What gods do you worship? Why did you leave the confines of your temple
      and take up a life of adventure? Have you turned your back on your faith,
      or do you seek to advance it?</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to
      Wisdom and one other ability score.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:&nbsp;</strong>Religion,
      and either Insight or Persuasion.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Languages:</strong>&nbsp;One of your choice</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 31
      gold):</strong>&nbsp;Holy symbol (amulet or reliquary), common clothes,
      robe, and a prayer book, prayer wheel, or prayer beads.</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong><em>Feature:
      Ordination</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You are expected to
      perform the religious ceremonies of your faith, including weddings and
      funerals. In exchange, members of your faith will provide you and your
      companions food, lodging, and a moderate lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="Indent1"><strong><em>Adventures and
      Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>In small settlements
      without other resources, your authority may extend to such matters as
      settling disputes and punishing criminals. You might also be expected to
      deal with local outbreaks of supernatural dangers such as fiendish
      possessions, cults, and the unquiet dead.</p>

      <p class="Indent1">If you solve several problems brought to you by members
      of your faith, you may be promoted (or reinstated) within the hierarchy of
      your order. You gain the free service of up to 4 acolytes, and direct
      access to your order&rsquo;s leaders.</p>

      fellow acolyte you admire most.</li>
