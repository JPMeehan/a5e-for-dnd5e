      <p>You have lost your memory. Almost all hints as to who you might have
      once been are now gone&mdash;except for your memento and that one person
      who seems to recognize you.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Profound memory loss such as yours is almost always
      associated with trauma&mdash;and magical in nature. Brain damage and
      mental illness certainly can attack the identity, but they are associated
      with other profound setbacks such as the loss of speech, loss of motor
      coordination, and anterograde memory loss (memories after the incident are
      lost&mdash;not before like in your case). You find your capabilities oddly
      intact, and the faintest memories eke back to you as you deploy skills
      which your body remembers but your mind has forgotten.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Feature: Memory Surge.</strong> Whenever you gain
      inspiration, you gain an expertise die which you can use on one d20 roll
      before your next long rest.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Adventures and Advancement.</strong> The cryptic
      encounters you have as a result of your connection and memento lead you
      upon a series of quests to help you uncover more clues about your
      identity.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">After enough adventures along these lines, you might have a
      better clue about who you once were&mdash;or at least who you are now. At
      any time when you complete a long rest, you can permanently replace this
      background with another agreed upon between you and the Narrator. (This
      does not grant you a new connection or memento, or any new equipment.)</p>
