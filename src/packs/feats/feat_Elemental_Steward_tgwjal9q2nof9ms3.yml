      <p>You have the ability to control the elements and have also been
      entrusted with a magical item of considerable power. These things may be
      related, or it may be coincidence. In either case, you have begun to learn
      to combine them.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain
      a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score,
      to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You may use your elementalist spell
      points and artifact charges interchangeably.</li><li>You gain an
      additional benefit based on the form your bonded artifact takes:<ul><li>If
      your bonded artifact is a <em>Weapon of Power</em>, it deals an additional
      d4 of damage on a successful attack. This damage type may be any type you
      can produce with your Elemental Blast feature.</li><li>If your bonded
      artifact is an <em>Armor of Power</em>, it is charged with elemental
      energies. Creatures grappling or grappled by you take 1d6 points of damage
      at the start of their turn. This damage type may be any type you can
      produce with your Elemental Blast feature.</li><li>If your bonded artifact
      is a <em>Font of Power</em>, it functions as a spellcasting focus for both
      your wielder and elementalist spells, and it also allows you finer control
      over the elements. Choose an additional Elemental Adaptation you qualify
      for. As long as you have your Artifact of Power in hand, you can use this
      Elemental Adaptation, and it does not count against your maximum number of
      Elemental adaptations known.</li></ul></li></ul>
