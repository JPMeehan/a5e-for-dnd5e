      <p>Most clerics receive at least some training in religious doctrine,
      either through formal instruction, divine revelation, or by having it
      shoved in their faces by entities that will not be ignored.
      &nbsp;Theologians go far beyond this, dedicating themselves to studying
      their faith, and more broadly the concept of religion and faith in
      general, with a scholar&rsquo;s dedication and thirst for knowledge.
      &nbsp;Philosophers of religion, there are some who joke that a theologian
      understands dogma better than the gods they serve, and while that is
      almost certainly an exaggeration their dedication does reap divine
      blessings and reward. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain
      a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom score, to a
      maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain proficiency with religion if you do
      not already have it. &nbsp;If you are already proficient, you gain an
      expertise die on religion checks. &nbsp;Either way you also gain an
      additional skill specialty in religion. &nbsp;You may always use either
      wisdom or intelligence on religion checks, your choice.</li><li>Once per
      short or long rest, you may spend 1 minute in prayer and expend a hit die
      to make a DC 20 religion check using either intelligence or wisdom.
      &nbsp;If successful, you regain an expended use of channel
      divinity.</li></ul>
