      <p>Your time studying the lessons of nature have left you particularly
      adept at heading its call and calling in turn to its children. &nbsp;You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain an additional specialty
      with nature, and the maximum size for an expertise die on nature checks
      for you is 1d10.</li><li>You may spend 1 minute and expend either a use of
      wild shape or a hit die and a point of inspiration to replicate the effect
      of a @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.pdwrag8eq7r0ldcp]{Commune
      with Nature} spell. Similar to scholar abilities, this does not count as
      actually casting a spell. Furthermore, you may attempt a DC 15 nature
      check as an action to regain a use of wild shape. &nbsp;Each time you do
      this, the DC for subsequent attempts cumulatively increases by 5, and once
      you fail a check you cannot attempt to do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</li><li>You may add half your scholar levels to your druid level to
      determine the effect of your wild shape ability, including access to
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.86p2i6t3jepq1c3q]{Improved
      Natural Bond} and
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.y5r5pal11p8i9laz]{Greater
      Natural Bond}.</li><li>You also gain a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.l3qkjox9faldupcy]{Druidic
      Lore} ability of your choice.</li></ul>
