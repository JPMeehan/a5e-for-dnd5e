      <p>You have learned to supplement your divine power with survival training
      &hellip; or perhaps it is the other way &lsquo;round. In either case, you
      can carry the word of your god to remote places, or at least ones that
      require travel through the wilderness, with less fear than most. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom score increases by +1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li>You can enhance your training with a boost of
      divine power. When you use <em>Stride and Seek</em>, you may spend a use
      of <em>Channel Divinity</em>.<ul><li>If you are using <em>Hunter&rsquo;s
      Target</em>, the bonus damage increases to 2d6.</li><li>If you are using
      <em>Swift Feet</em>, it lasts for 10 minutes and your movement increases
      by 5 feet for the duration.</li></ul></li><li>Gain an
      additional&nbsp;<em>Exploration Knack</em> or <em>Sign of Faith</em> of
      your choice. It does not count against your maximum number known, and in
      the future, when you would select a <em>Sign of Faith</em>&nbsp;or
      <em>Exploration Knack</em>, you can choose from either list.</li></ul>
