      <p>Your animal companion gains an expertise die on attack rolls if you are
      within 60 feet and not incapacitated, and you gain an expertise die on
      attack rolls if at least one of your animal companions is within 5 feet of
      the target and not incapacitated. If you can see your animal companion
      when it fails a saving throw of a type you are proficient in, you may use
      your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the roll, potentially
      turning it into a success.</p>
