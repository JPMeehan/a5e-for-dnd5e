      <p>While raging and wearing light or no armor, you have advantage on
      Dexterity ability checks and saving throws. If you fail a Strength or
      Dexterity based ability check or saving throw while raging, you can use
      your reaction to roll your martial arts die and add it to the total,
      potentially turning it into a success.</p>
