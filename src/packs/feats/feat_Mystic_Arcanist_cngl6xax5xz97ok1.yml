      <p>The arcane and the divine are but two aspects of the same power seen
      through different lenses, and those with arcane blood running through
      their veins and divine words chanted in their ears can access magic in its
      purest form. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom or
      Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>When you cast a
      spell that restores hit points, you restore an additional number of hit
      points equal to your Charisma modifier.</li><li>You can spend sorcery
      points to temporarily gain a spell from the cleric or sorcerer spell
      lists. Temporarily gaining a spell in this way costs a number of sorcery
      points equal to the spell&rsquo;s level. You cannot gain a spell in this
      way that has a level higher than your highest level spell slot. When you
      gain a cleric spell in this way, it is considered prepared for the day.
      When you gain a sorcerer spell in this way, it is considered a spell you
      know for the day. You lose all spells gained in this way whenever you
      finish a long rest .</li></ul>
