      <p>You've honed your skill with ranged weapons to a razor's edge. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain proficiency with the
      Farshot Stance and Ricochet maneuvers, and do not have to spend exertion
      to activate them.</p></li><li><p>Before you make an attack with a ranged
      weapon you are proficient with, you can choose to take a penalty on the
      attack roll equal to your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you deal
      extra damage equal to double your proficiency bonus. This extra damage
      does not double on a critical hit.</p></li><li><p>You ignore half cover
      and three-quarters cover when making a ranged weapon attack.</p></li></ul>
