      <p>While wielding an adept weapon, you can spend an action to perform a
      display of supreme weapon prowess. Enemies within 30 feet who can see you
      must make a Wisdom save against your maneuver DC or be rattled for one
      minute. Creatures that fail their save by more than 5 are frightened
      instead.</p>
