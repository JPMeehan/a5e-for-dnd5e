      <p>You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>When you attack with a
      glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear using the Attack action, you can
      use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the weaponâ€™s opposite end.
      This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack, dealing
      1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.</p></li><li><p>While you are wielding a
      glaive, halberd, pike, quarterstaff, or spear, a creature that enters your
      reach provokes an opportunity attack from you. A creature can use its
      reaction to avoid provoking an opportunity attack from you in this
      way.</p></li></ul>
