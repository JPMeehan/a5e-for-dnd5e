      <p>It is not uncommon for scholars to, in their most contemplative
      studies, awaken psionic ability. &nbsp;Some view this as merely a
      distraction to be ignored, but for others, it is a new horizon of studies
      they throw themselves into mastering. &nbsp;Likewise, many Espers are not
      content to merely practice their mental abilities, but seek mastery
      through truly understanding them, with a scholar&rsquo;s rigor. &nbsp;Both
      are psionic experts. &nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You
      may add your intelligence modifier to concentration checks made for
      scholar abilities, psionic powers, or attack modes for your mind strike.
      &nbsp;</li><li>Additionally, whenever you make an ability check or saving
      throw using intelligence, you may expend a die from your psi reservoir.
      &nbsp;You may roll this die and add it to the result. &nbsp;You may choose
      to do so after the roll is made but before the result is declared. &nbsp;A
      die is recovered on a maximum roll and lost on a roll of 1 or 2 when used
      in this way as normal.</li><li>Finally you gain proficiency with the
      Awakened Mind combat tradition if you are not already. &nbsp;If you are,
      you gain proficiency in another tradition from the scholar list. You learn
      one awakened mind combat maneuver that does not count against your normal
      limit of maneuvers known.</li></ul>
