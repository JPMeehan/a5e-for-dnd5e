      <p>Nightstalkers are dedicated spies, saboteurs, and assassins, trained in
      ancient techniques that strain the limits of physical ability and verge on
      the supernatural. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your
      Dexterity or Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</p></li><li><p>You may deal Sneak Attack damage when making attacks
      using unarmed strikes or adept weapons.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You gain a
      bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on Acrobatics, Deception, and Stealth
      checks.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; In addition, you gain the following special
      focus feature:</p><p><strong>Twilight Vanish. </strong>Nightstalkers can
      move with such swiftness that it takes a trained eye to see the motion at
      all. On your turn you can use a reaction and spend 2 exertion to move up
      to 30 feet with such incredible speed that you seem to disappear, and
      after moving this way may immediately take the Hide action.</p>
