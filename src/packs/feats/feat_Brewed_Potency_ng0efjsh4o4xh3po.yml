      <p>In your attempts to perfect your trancing draughts, you have gained
      deeper levels of mastery of herbs, helpful and harmful. &nbsp;You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain the Witch's Brew ability if you do
      not already have it. &nbsp;If you do, half your berserker levels count as
      witch levels for the purposes of it.</li><li>You gain proficiency with
      poisoner's kit if you did not already have it, or an expertise die on
      checks made with it if you do.</li><li>When you enter an ecstatic rage you
      may expend a spell slot of first level or higher to magically manifest a
      noxious magical poison on one or two weapons you are holding, provided
      they deal piercing or slashing damage. &nbsp;While your ecstatic rage
      lasts as long as you are holding these weapons, they deal an additional
      1d4 bonus poison damage or 1d8 if the weapon is wielded with two
      hands.</li></ul>
