      <p>You have delved even deeper into your studies of the nature and
      theoretical underpinnings of all magic, gaining the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You may add your scholar levels to your wizard levels
      to determine the effectiveness of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.iqlgotutphoratct]{Arcane
      Recovery}. &nbsp;</li><li>You also learn a number of additional spells
      from the wizard list equal to your proficiency bonus, adding them to your
      spellbook, and gain an additional one everytime your proficiency bonus
      goes up. &nbsp;These may be of any level for which you have slots, even if
      your wizard level would not normally be high enough to allow it. Wizard
      spells gained in other ways, such as on normal level up or by copying from
      a scroll or spellbook, are limited by your wizard level as normal. If you
      choose to learn one of these bonus spells normally, either on wizard level
      up, by copying a scroll or spellbook, or through some other means, you may
      choose a new bonus spell in its place.</li><li>You gain one additional
      Elective Study and Scholarly Discovery of your choice.</li></ul>
