      <p>You have embraced your vampirism, unlocking ever more and greater dark
      gifts. Your bite damage increases to 1d8, a creature affected by your
      Charming Gaze remains charmed for a number of hours equal to your level,
      and you regain the use of Charming Gaze when you finish a short or long
      rest. You also gain the Spider Climb and Vampiric Regeneration
      features.</p><p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> You gain a climb
      speed equal to your Speed, and you can climb even on difficult surfaces
      and upside down on ceilings.</p><p><strong><em>Vampiric Regeneration.
      </em></strong>Whenever you start your turn with at least 1 hit point and
      you haven't taken radiant damage or entered direct sunlight since the end
      of your last turn, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to
      twice your proficiency bonus.</p><p>The price for your vampirism becomes
      all the greater. When you end your turn in contact with running water, you
      take 20 radiant damage.</p>
