      <p>You channel your zeal into your most devastating blows to bring divine
      judgment to the enemies of your faith, avenge those under its protection,
      and defend yourself from those who would defy you. &nbsp;You gain the
      following additional special Furious Critical options:</p><ul><li>Raging
      Divinity- Immediately after resolving the triggering attack, you may cast
      one of the following spells:
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.1vo427vjnzgzb5z2]{Cure Wounds}
      targeting yourself,
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.sgiwn0n20mnf1ddx]{Lesser
      Restoration} targeting yourself,
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel Magic}
      targeting yourself or the creature struck, or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.bs1zn1s8ewwa4tfx]{Command}
      targeting the creature struck (if upcast you may target other creatures as
      well as long as one of the targets is the creature struck). &nbsp;No
      additional action is required, but you must expend a spell slot and have
      the chosen spell prepared as normal. &nbsp;You may cast the listed spells
      as part of this ability even when raging.</li><li>Divine Wrath- The target
      of the attack gains one level of strife. &nbsp;Creatures with an opposite
      alignment from yours or that worship a greater entity that has an opposite
      alignment suffer two levels of strife instead. &nbsp;A creature may not
      gain more than four levels of strife from this ability in one 24 hour
      period.</li></ul>
