      <p>There are those whose righteous (or unholy) anger burns with a fervor
      beyond the pale of most people&rsquo;s understanding, even the faithful.
      Utterly dedicated and burning with a wrath against the enemies of their
      faith, these zealots use their oath to channel their fury towards very
      specific ends. &nbsp;Not a mad dog, but a focused hunter. &nbsp;You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of
      your Strength or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>If your
      fanatic damage type is radiant, you gain your choice of the Lawful or Good
      alignment traits. &nbsp;If it is necrotic, you instead gain your choice of
      the Evil or Chaotic alignment traits. &nbsp;Once chosen your alignment
      trait cannot be changed, but you can gain a second alignment trait that is
      not opposed.</li><li>You gain proficiency with the Zealous Stance combat
      maneuver and do not have to spend exertion to activate it.
      &nbsp;Furthermore, you gain the following additional benefits while
      Zealous Stance is active:</li><li>Half your berserker levels count as
      herald levels for the purpose of the damage dealt by your divine smite
      ability.</li><li>Half your herald levels count as berserker levels for the
      purpose of the Crushing Blows ability.</li><li>You may cast herald spells
      with a range of self or touch while raging, and may concentrate on the
      following spells while raging:
