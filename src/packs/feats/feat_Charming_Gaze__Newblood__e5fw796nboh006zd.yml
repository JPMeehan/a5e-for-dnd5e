    value: >-
      <p>You magically target a creature within 30 feet, forcing it to make a
      Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
      modifier). On a failure, the target is charmed by you for a number of
      hours equal to your proficiency bonus. While charmed it regards you as a
      trusted friend and is a willing target for your bite. The target repeats
      the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on
      a success. If the target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends
      for it, it is immune to your charm for 24 hours. Once you have used this
      feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
