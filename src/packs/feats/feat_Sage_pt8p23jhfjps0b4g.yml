      <p>Walking the line between a wizard&rsquo;s practical mastery of the
      arcane and a scholar&rsquo;s theoretical dabblings, a sage knows more
      about magic than perhaps any other who walks the world. &nbsp;You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your Intelligence
      score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain the Academic option for
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.szxgzc4zmt9zam9f]{Scholarly
      Excellence} if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you do, you gain a
      different Scholarly Excellence option of your choice.</li><li>Any spells
      you replicate using a Scholarly Discovery by expending a hit die and/or
      inspiration you may also cast using a spell slot if you have a spell slot
      of high enough level. &nbsp;These spells count as Scholar spells known for
      you.</li></ul>
