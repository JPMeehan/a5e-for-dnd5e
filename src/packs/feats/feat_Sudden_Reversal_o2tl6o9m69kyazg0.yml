      <p>While raging, as a bonus action you can choose to give opponents
      advantage on attack rolls against you. If you do so, until the start of
      your next turn you can spend 1 exertion point to make one attack with an
      unarmed strike or improvised weapon or perform one basic maneuver each
      time a creature hits you with an attack. You can use your special exertion
      pool from the Pugilist feat to do so.</p>

      <p>In addition, when you critically hit with an unarmed strike or
      improvised weapon attack while raging, you deal additional damage equal to
      a roll of your martial arts die. This is added to the extra damage dealt
      by the critical hit and is not multiplied as part of the critical hit.</p>
