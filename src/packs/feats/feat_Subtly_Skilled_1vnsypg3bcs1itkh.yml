      <p>A nightstalker’s true strength isn’t brute force—you are an
      infiltrator, deceiver, a voice in the right ear or a knife to the right
      neck, and you turn your physical and mental discipline into the subtlest
      of manipulations and subterfuge.&nbsp;</p><p>You may add your martial arts
      die as a bonus to Acrobatics, Culture, Deception, Engineering,
      Intimidation, Investigation, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Perception,
      Performance, and Persuasion checks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
