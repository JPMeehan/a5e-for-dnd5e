      <p>Your ability to conduct the raw stuff of magic deppens, conjuring magic
      out of music beyond normal spellcasting. &nbsp;You gain the second Battle
      Hymn Specialization option if you do not already have it, or a different
      battle hymn specialization option if you do. &nbsp;The total number of
      spells you may select for this ability is increased to your proficiency
      bonus and anytime you take a level of witch or bard you may exchange one
      of these spells for another one. &nbsp;First and second level spells
      replicated this way require only 1 use of Bardic Inspiration rather than
      2. You may choose any spell that does not have a material component, as
      opposed to those that only have a vocalized component, but may only
      perform those with seen components if you are benefiting from the Visual
      Art Specialty. &nbsp;Finally, when selecting spells that are on both the
      witch and bard spell list, you may choose spells of any level you possess
      spell slots for rather than only 4th-level or lower. &nbsp;Casting spells
      of 5th level or higher using this ability also requires expending a spell
      slot of the appropriate level in addition to the 2 bardic inspiration
      uses, but otherwise follows the normal rules for the ability.</p>
