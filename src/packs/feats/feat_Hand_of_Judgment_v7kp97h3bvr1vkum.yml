      <p>You have learned to ride the falling edge of your wrath as well as its
      rise, meting out judgment both hot and cold. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>When your rage ends, you regain a number of spent
      hit points in your Lay on Hands pool equal to your proficiency bonus. (Any
      excess beyond your pool maximum is lost.)</p></li><li><p>If you are
      blinded or deafened, you may still use your Danger Sense, but must spend a
      use of your Divine Sense to do so.</p></li><li><p>When you convert a spell
      slot into exertion points, if you have one or more uses of Rage remaining,
      you are healed for a number of hit points equal to the level of the
      converted spell slot.</p></li><li><p>While you are raging, your melee
      weapon attacks deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.</p></li></ul>
