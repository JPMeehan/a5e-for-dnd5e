  description:
    value: >-
      <p>All vigilantes eventually become symbols, and you are a legend that
      strikes fear into the hearts of those that would stand against you.
      Creatures with a CR lower than your alter egoâ€™s Prestige rating are
      frightened of you while you are in your alter ego.</p><p>In addition, you
      become particularly adept at subduing your enemies rather than outright
      killing them. Whenever you begin a turn grappling a creature, you can
      attempt to non-lethally subdue it. The grappled creature makes a
      Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed saving
      throw, a creature is knocked unconscious for the next hour. A creature
      with more than 25% of its maximum hit points automatically succeeds on
      this saving throw.</p>
