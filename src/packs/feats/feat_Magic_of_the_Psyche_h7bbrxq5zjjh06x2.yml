      <p>Your mastery of your own mind and dreams deepens, leading you ever
      closer to the unified underpinnings of your abilities. &nbsp;You gain the
      following additional abilities:</p><ul><li>You may apply any of the basic
      psionic power augments to spells of 1st-level or higher you cast as if
      they were psionic powers. The number of psi dice you may spend on augments
      for a given casting cannot exceed the level of the spell slot
      expended.</li><li>You may expend a psi die when casting a spell of
      1st-level or higher with a cast time of one action, bonus action, or
      reaction. &nbsp;When doing so, you may ignore any vocalized, seen, or
      material components of the casting except those material components with a
      non-trivial gold value. &nbsp;Such a psi die is rolled and lost or
      regained if it were used for an augment.</li><li>You gain the Book of
      Dreams ritual mastery option if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you
      do, you gain a different ritual mastery option. &nbsp;If you gain it from
      this feat, it comes with a number of rituals in it equal to your witch
      level + your esper level - 7. If you already had it and it has fewer
      rituals in it than that, you may immediately add rituals up to that
      number, and may add a new one anytime you gain a level of witch or
      esper.</li></ul>
