      <p>You have come to be more at home on the battlefield than any stage, and
      your performances reflect this. You gain the following additional Battle
      Hymn options, which are only usable while you are in your War
      Dance:</p><ul><li>Infectious Dance. Choose one creature within 30ft that
      can see you. You may cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.gitnhp5bf3rcee0b]{Wild
      Irresistible Dance} rare spell on them, benefitting from any active art
      specialties or masteries if appropriate, requiring a seen instead of a
      vocalized component, and requiring no concentration beyond that of the
      battle hymn. &nbsp;A creature that saves against this battle hymn is
      immune to it for 24 hours. &nbsp;This battle hymn lasts up to 1 minute,
      but ends early if you start a different battle hymn or if your War Dance
      ends.</li><li>Shared Dance. All allies within 60ft benefit from any adept
      dances you benefit from until the start of your next turn.</li></ul>
