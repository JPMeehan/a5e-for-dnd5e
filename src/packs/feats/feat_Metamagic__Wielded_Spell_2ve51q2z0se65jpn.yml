      <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-0be19950-7fff-3ec2-605a-eb5181332fa2">When
      you cast a spell with a casting time of one action and a single target,
      you can spend a sorcery point to store it in a melee weapon. You may only
      have one spell stored this way at a time. When you hit with an attack
      using the melee weapon, the target takes damage as normal and you can use
      your reaction to cast the spell on the target of the attack. If you begin
      a rest with a spell stored this way, it is wasted and lost.</span></p>
