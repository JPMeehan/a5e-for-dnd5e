      <p>Not content to just see what happens with the legendary artifact in
      your possession, you have dedicated yourself to the study of magic items
      to see what makes it tick.&nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score, to a maximum value of
      20.</li><li>You can ignore the usual restriction about infusions needing
      to be placed only on mundane items where your Bonded Artifact is concerned
      and may place an infusion on it, provided the artifact is the right type
      of item to take the infusion and provided the infusion does not only
      provide a static bonus to either AC or to attack and damage. If the
      infusion provides such a bonus in addition to other effects, use the
      higher of the two values by the infusion and your Bonded Artifact. The
      infusion&rsquo;s effects are otherwise cumulative with those of the Bonded
      Artifact itself if possible. If the effects are contradictory with those
      of the Bonded Artifact in some way, you may switch between the
      capabilities of your Bonded Artifact and the infusion or vice versa as a
      bonus action. If the infusion would normally require attunement, that
      requirement is waived when it is applied to your Bonded
      Artifact.</li></ul>
