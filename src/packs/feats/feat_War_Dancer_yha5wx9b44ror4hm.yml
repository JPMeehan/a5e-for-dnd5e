      <p>For some, the line between battle and dance is blurred to the point of
      nonexistence. &nbsp;Whether in one on one duels or on the battlefield,
      they glide across their chosen arena with a grace that can only be called
      dance, even by those on the receiving end of its wrath. &nbsp;You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your
      Dexterity or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain
      one of the adept's dance Focus Features, and treat your adept level as
      your adept+bard level for the purpose of qualifying for dances or Focus
      Features that require dances.</li><li>As a bonus action, you may expend 2
      exertion to enter a War Dance. &nbsp;You cannot enter a war dance if you
      are wearing armor or using a shield. &nbsp;A War Dance lasts for 1 minute
      and ends early if you are incapacitated or your movement speed is reduced
      to 0. &nbsp;While in a War Dance you gain the following
      benefits:<ul><li>Your AC is equal to 10+your dexterity modifier+your
      wisdom modifier+your charisma modifier.</li><li>You may start an adept
      dance as part of the same bonus action you use to start your war dance,
      spending exertion as normal. &nbsp;When starting your War Dance or while
      it is ongoing the exertion cost of any adept dances or any Focus Features
      that require dances are reduced by 1.</li><li>When you fail a Strength or
      Dexterity saving throw, you may use your reaction to spend 1 exertion
      point to make a Performance(charisma) check, applying the dance specialty
      of you have it, and replacing the result of your save if it is
      higher.</li></ul></li></ul>
