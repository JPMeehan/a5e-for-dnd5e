      <p>Those that steal gold and those that steal power from the otherworldly
      must both walk among the shadows. The darkness consumes some, the light
      catches others, but some special few manage to slip through and like them
      you dance unseen along reality’s edge.</p><p>You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as
      if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Unlike
      other forms of darkvision you can see color in this way as if you were
      seeing normally. If you already had darkvision or would gain it later from
      another feature, its range increases by 30 feet.</p></li><li><p>You can
      use a bonus action and spend 1 spell point to teleport up to 30 feet to an
      unoccupied area of darkness or dim light you can see. You must currently
      be in an area of darkness or dim light to teleport in this way. You can
      bring along objects if their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You
      can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller, provided it
      isn’t carrying gear beyond its carrying capacity and is within 5 feet. You
      can increase the range of this teleport by 30 additional feet per each
      additional spell point you spend.</p></li></ul>
