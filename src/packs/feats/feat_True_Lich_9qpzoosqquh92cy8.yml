      <p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">You have become a true lich, a
      virtually unkillable undead spellcaster, learned in the ways of forbidden
      lore and deathless study.</span></p>

      <ul>

      <li>You no longer require food, water, sleep, or air to survive.</li>

      <li>You are immune to the charmed, frightened, and paralyzed conditions
      and necrotic damage. You gain the Undead creature type in addition to your
      other types.</li>

      <li><strong><em>True Soul Vessel.&nbsp;</em></strong>If you are slain and
      your soul vessel is intact, you return in [[/r 1d10]] days, forming a new
      body if necessary. Your Soul vessel itself becomes very durable as well.
      Its AC rises to 21, it has 90 hit points, it is immune to damage from
      non-magical weapons and resistant to all other damage except force
      damage.</li>

      <li><strong><em>Supreme Forbidden Knowledge.&nbsp;</em></strong>You learn
      a new 6th-level spell, 7th-level spell, and 8th-level spell. The spells
      must be ones from the <em>necromancy</em>, <em>affliction</em>,
      <em>knowledge</em>, <em>necrotic</em>, <em>psychic</em>, or <em>scrying
      </em>schools.&nbsp;These spells do not count against the spells you know
      or can have prepared, and they always count as being prepared. These
      spells are added to your class's spell list for you; if you have more than
      one spellcasting class, you choose which list to add them to.</li>

      <li><strong><em>Sabotage Spell.&nbsp;</em></strong>You also gain
      lichdom&rsquo;s most feared power: the means to sunder the spells of other
      spellcasters. When another creature within 60 feet casts a spell, you may
      use your reaction to attempt to destroy the spell and punish the caster.
      You must make an Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma check (chosen when you
      acquire this feat and may not be changed) with a DC of 10 + the
      spell&rsquo;s level. If the check succeeds, the spell fails and the caster
      takes 3d6 necrotic damage.&nbsp;Once you have used this ability a number
      of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, you can&rsquo;t do so again
      until you finish a long rest.</li>
