      <p>Eldritch archers combine the precision and skill of a fighter with the
      magical dedication of a wizard to perform otherwise impossible feats of
      archery and spellcasting. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Whenever you make a ranged weapon attack you can
      choose to conjure magical ammunition and select one of the following
      damage types: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. Your ranged weapon attacks
      using this conjured ammunition deal the chosen damage type instead of
      whatever damage type they would normally deal, and are considered magical
      for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
      attacks and damage. Ammunition conjured in this way disappears at the end
      of the turn it was fired.</p></li><li><p>When you hit a target with a
      ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction and choose a spell of
      1st-level or higher, casting it through your ammunition. The spell must
      have a casting time of 1 action, and target a single creature or have a
      range of Touch. If a spell cast in this way requires an attack roll and
      targets the same target as the triggering ranged weapon attack, it also
      hits as part of that attack. You may choose not to deal damage with a
      ranged weapon attack used to cast a spell.</p></li></ul>
