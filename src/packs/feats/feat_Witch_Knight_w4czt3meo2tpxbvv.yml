      <p>Not all witches confine themselves to magic alone. &nbsp;Whether a
      witch that saw fit to train themselves in the use of arms and armor, or a
      herald who swore an oath on and to magic, witch-knights are armored
      martial casters of the highest degree, driven to their dual pursuits by
      the fervor of their oath. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You
      gain a +1 bonus to your Charisma score, to a maximum value of
      20.</li><li>If your witch spellcasting ability modifier is not charisma,
      you may change it to charisma.</li><li>You gain proficiency with the
      cutting omen combat tradition.</li><li>You gain the Hands of Healing
      magical mystery if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you do, you may
      choose a Magical Mystery or Divine Lesson of your choice. &nbsp;The points
      from this pool and your Lay on Hands pool are combined
      together.</li><li>Anytime you gain a divine lesson or magical mystery, you
      may gain one of the other instead, and may add your herald and witch
      levels together for the purpose of qualify for them.</li><li>You may
      expend a use of divine sense to cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect
      Magic}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.jlqrjd03lyl8zb3c]{Detect Evil
      and Good}, or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.4colmy0s3zjs0hy8]{Detect Poison and
      Disease} spells.</li><li>You may deliver your Lay on Hands or Hands of
      Healing effects through your familiar as if they were a touch
      spell.</li></ul>
