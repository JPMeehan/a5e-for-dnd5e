      <p dir="ltr">Your smite instead deals force damage, and you can cast a
      cantrip you know with a casting time of one action with no additional
      action required. If you drop the target to zero hit points, you can choose
      to recover a spent first- or second- level spell slot instead of casting a
      cantrip.</p>
