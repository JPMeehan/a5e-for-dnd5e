    description: >-
      <p>A bewildered creature is overwhelmed by trying to process a particular
      event. Its mind begins to play tricks, altering its perceptions. A
      bewildered creature has disadvantage on social-based ability checks as it
      struggles to engage with whatâ€™s happening. When a bewildered creature
      would succeed on an ability check, roll another d20. On a result of 15 or
      less the creature succeeds, but otherwise it fails the ability check
      instead. This could be caused by a temporary forgetfulness that leads the
      creature to forget what it was trying to achieve, or in some cases a brief
      hallucination that alters the circumstances in such a way that it is
      unable to succeed.</p>
