      <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c8cbce18-7fff-66e9-39a4-5b9629fde5b2">When
      you cast a spell that deals psychic damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point
      and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes psychic damage
      from the spell, it also suffers from the Bewildered mental stress effect
      and has disadvantage on Perception and Insight checks for a number of
      rounds equal to the level of the spell (minimum 1).</span></p>

      <p>A bewildered creature is overwhelmed by trying to process a particular
      event. Its mind begins to play tricks, altering its perceptions. A
      bewildered creature has disadvantage on social-based ability checks as it
      struggles to engage with whatâ€™s happening. When a bewildered creature
      would succeed on an ability check, roll another d20. On a result of 15 or
      less the creature succeeds, but otherwise it fails the ability check
      instead. This could be caused by a temporary forgetfulness that leads the
      creature to forget what it was trying to achieve, or in some cases a brief
      hallucination that alters the circumstances in such a way that it is
      unable to succeed.</p>
