      <p>Your magical scholarship continues apace, and while your progress is
      slower than those pursuing only a single discipline, you gain insights
      they do not.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You can
      attune to an additional magic item (for a total of 4), but at least two of
      the items must be a wand, staff, scroll (see below), or item that can be
      used as a spellcasting focus. This stacks with Technological Attunement,
      if applicable.</li><li>You have built your spellbook to last. It can be
      stolen or deliberately destroyed, but it cannot be incidentally damaged by
      fire, water, or the like.</li><li>When you perform the Spellcraft activity
      to research artificer or wizard spells during downtime, you gain an
      expertise die on the roll and the time and materials costs are reduced by
      25%.</li><li>You may attune to a spell scroll with a wizard or artificer
      spell of a level no higher than the highest-level artificer spell you can
      cast as a spell invention with a fizzle die of 1d4. When the scroll
      fizzles, it is destroyed.</li></ul>
