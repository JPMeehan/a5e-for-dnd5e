      <p>You are a skilled rider, especially adept at fighting from the back of
      a mount. While mounted, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You
      gain proficiency with the Lancer Strike maneuver and do not have to spend
      exertion to activate it.</p></li><li><p>When your mount is targeted by an
      attack, you can make yourself the attackâ€™s target
      instead.</p></li><li><p>When your mount makes a Dexterity saving throw
      against an effect that deals half damage on a success, it takes no damage
      on a success and half damage on a failure.</p></li></ul>
