      <p>At the end of the long road you have chosen to walk is power and
      purpose. You have seized the former in service to the latter and woe
      betide those who would oppose you. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Your Strength, Intelligence or Charisma score increases by 1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li>

      <li>Half your wizard levels count as herald levels for the purpose of
      gaining the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.b6bbf481xmj9mi6u]{Extra
      Attack} and
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.u220f22b3cpphtgb]{Empowered
      Smite} features.</li>

      <li>Half your herald levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of
      gaining the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.iojeid79x6ghgcw9]{Signature
      Spells} feature. Additionally, you can choose a herald or wizard spell as
      your signature spell choice.</li>

      <li>You gain proficiency with your choice of the Cutting Omen or
      Sanctified Steel combat traditions and a single maneuver from your chosen
      tradition of a level you can learn. It does not count against your
      maneuvers known.</li>

      <li>You gain the following additional Empowered Smite option:</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Arcane Smite</h2>

      <p>Your smite instead deals force damage, and you can cast a cantrip you
      know with a casting time of one action with no additional action required.
      If you drop the target to zero hit points, you can choose to recover a
      spent first- or second- level spell slot instead of casting a cantrip.</p>
