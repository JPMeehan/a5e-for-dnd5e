      a talent for inspirational communication, giving your commands and
      exhortations an artistic flair. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>

      <li>You gain proficiency with the Perform skill fi you don't already have
      it, and an expertise die if you do. Your maximum expertise die size for
      perform also increases to a d10.</li>

      <li>When you use Rallying Surge to heal a creature, you can also cast a
      bard spell with a singletarget and a casting time of one action on it as
      part of the same bonus action. Once you have used this feature, you can't
      do so again until you finish a long rest. If your Rallying Surge affects
      more than one creature, the spell's effects are replicated on each
      creature you targeted with Rallying Surge. Half of your marshal levels
      count as bard levels for the purpose of determining which Battle Hymns you
      can learn.</li>

      <li>Half of your bard levels count as marshal levels for the purpose of
      determining the range of your Commanding Presence feature.</li>
