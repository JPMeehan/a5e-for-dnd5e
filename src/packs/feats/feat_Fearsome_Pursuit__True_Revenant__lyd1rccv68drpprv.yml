    value: >-
      <p>You can spend 1 minute focusing on a creature that is part of your
      vendetta. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, you
      learn that. Otherwise, after focusing, you know the distance and direction
      to that creature, and so long as youâ€™re moving in pursuit of that
      creature, you and anyone traveling with you ignore difficult terrain. This
      effect ends if you take damage or end your turn without moving for any
      reason.</p>
