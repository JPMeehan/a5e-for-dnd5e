      <p>You have come to rely on the combination of survival training, combat
      skill, and psionic power that you have cultivated. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain access to the <em>Awakened Mind</em> combat
      tradition if you do not already have it, or a combat tradition available
      to the Ranger class if you do. You learn a maneuver from the <em>Awakened
      Mind</em> tradition of a level you could learn. It does not count against
      your maneuvers known.</li><li>The bonus damage from <em>Trained
      Accuracy</em> may be psychic damage if you wish. If you choose this option
      while your <em>Psychic Focus</em> is active, the dice increase to
      d8s.</li><li>Your <em>Esper</em> levels count as <em>Ranger</em> levels
      for the purpose of gaining the <em>Wilderness Mystique</em> feature, and
      when you do, you may select a second option.</li></ul>
