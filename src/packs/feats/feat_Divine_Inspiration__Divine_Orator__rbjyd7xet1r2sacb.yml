      <p>When an ally within 15 feet hits a creature with a melee weapon attack,
      your ally can deliver a Divine Smite just as if you had delivered it
      yourself using your Divine Smite feature (expending one of your uses). If
      you are able to empower your smites, you may choose to empower it as
      normal.</p>
