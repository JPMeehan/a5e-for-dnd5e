    value: >-
      <p>Your studies have allowed you to catch a glimpse, however brief, of the
      deeper cosmic truths your faith has to offer, broadening your awareness
      and granting the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to
      your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom score, to a maximum value of
      20.</li><li>You gain an additional specialty with religion, and the
      maximum size for an expertise die on religion checks for you is
      1d12.</li><li>You may spend a hit die or a use of channel divinity to
      replicate the effects of an
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.qsa7b22n3y1pbzf6]{Augury} or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.bs3wnsid88tbup6c]{Divination}
      spell. &nbsp;Alternatively you may expend a hit die and a use of channel
      divinity or either one and inspiration to replicate the effects of a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.h5ssew7apf5ofbhc]{Commune}
      spell. &nbsp;Similar to scholar abilities, this does not count as actually
      casting a spell. &nbsp;After replicating any of the above spells, you may
      make a DC 25 religion check. &nbsp;On a success, this replication does not
      count towards the daily failure chance of the spell in question.
      &nbsp;This only applies to replicating a spell through this feat, not if
      you cast it through any other means.</li></ul>
