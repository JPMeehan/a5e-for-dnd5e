      <p>Your skill at magical trickery has improved and you can use magical
      force to perform your clandestine skills at a distance. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You learn the mage hand cantrip if you
      do not already know it (if you do, you learn another wizard cantrip of
      your choosing in its place. The new cantrip does not count against your
      maximum cantrips known.</p></li><li><p>When cast by you, mage hand creates
      a pair of hands instead of one. The hands also have Strength and Dexterity
      scores equal to your Intelligence score. You may use the mage hands to do
      anything your normal hands could do, but you must spend actions as normal
      to do so. If the hands are out of view, you must have some means of seeing
      what they are doing in order to use them (the arcane eye spell is a
      popular means of doing so for mages who can cast it). You may make attacks
      and even cast spells with the hands, but doing so expends your action as
      normal.</p></li><li><p>You may have the bonus damage from your Sneak
      Attack deal the same type of damage as a cantrip you know would deal. Once
      you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence
      modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p></li></ul>
