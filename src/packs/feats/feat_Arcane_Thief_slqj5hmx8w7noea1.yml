      <p>Your skill at magical subterfuge is such that you can break the rules
      of magic itself. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>When you successfully save against a spell, if it is on the Wizard
      list, you can use your reaction to attempt to learn the spell. Make an
      Arcana check with a DC equal to the save DC of the spell + the
      spell&rsquo;s level. If you succeed, you can scribe the spell into your
      spellbook as if you had a scroll to work with, though the monetary cost of
      doing so is doubled. If you use this ability again before scribing the
      spell, you can choose to retain either the new spell or the previous one.
      The other fades from your memory and cannot be scribed by this means
      unless it is cast on you again.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>When you copy a spell into your spellbook from a scroll, roll a d4. On
      a 4, the scroll is not consumed in the process and may be used as
      normal.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You can attempt to cast spell scrolls with spells not on your class
      list. To do so, make an Arcana check with a DC of 12 + the spell&rsquo;s
      level as an action. If you succeed, you cast the spell from the scroll
      normally. If you fail, the scroll is destroyed and wasted.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>
