      <p>You have further honed your ability to merge elementalism and nature
      magic.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Half your
      elementalist levels count as druid levels for the purpose of determining
      the options granted by
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild
      Shape}.</li><li>Half of your druid levels count as elementalist levels for
      the purpose of determining the effects of your Elemental
      Defense.</li><li>Your wild shape forms gain a speed boost if you have an
      appropriate elemental affinity. The form must possess the appropriate
      movement speed already to use this benefit. If you have multiple elemental
      affinities, you still may only use one of these benefits each time you use
      wild shape:<ul><li><strong>Earth:</strong> +10 feet to burrow speed and
      you may always choose to leave a tunnel behind
      you.</li><li><strong>Air:</strong> +10 feet to flying speed and you may
      hover even if that is not a normal option for your
      form.</li><li><strong>Water:</strong> +15 feet to swimming
      speed.</li><li><strong>Fire:</strong> +10 feet to walking and flying
      speeds.</li></ul></li></ul>
