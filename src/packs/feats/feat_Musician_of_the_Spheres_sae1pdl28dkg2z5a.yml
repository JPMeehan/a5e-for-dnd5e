      <p>Your practice and studies have attuned you to the music of the spheres,
      the cosmic song that echoes throughout creation and beyond, painting all
      the riotous colors within in a never ending mystical dance. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>When you use a battle hymn by expending a
      spell slot, it lasts a number of rounds equal to your charisma modifier
      rather than one round. &nbsp;You may choose new targets for an ongoing
      battle hymn at the start of your turn or anytime before the start of your
      next turn, but once chosen for a round they cannot be changed.</li><li>You
      may cast one of the following spells once per long rest without expending
      a spell
      slot:@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.5ijl5b1goq9774l3]{Teleport},@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.l3lr6rwvw7csn6on]{Plane
      Shift}, or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.j6guc3gcg18fn8rz]{Planar Ally}.
      &nbsp;In the case of plane shift you do not require the listed material
      component when casting it in this way but must instead research a tune or
      note attuned to the plane you wish to shift to using the research downtime
      activity and the Arcana skill, which counts as secret knowledge. &nbsp;In
      the case of planar ally you may make either a performance or musical
      instrument check with a DC of 5+the creature's CR for tasks measured in
      minutes, 10+the creature's CR for tasks measured in hours, or 15+the
      creature's CR for tasks measured in days. &nbsp;If the check is
      successful, you may use it in place of the payment of the spell. &nbsp;The
      chosen check must be one connected to an Art Specialty you are currently
      benefiting from, and you may only replace payment in this way one time
      each for the three spans of time, and when doing so the service lasts for
      exactly 1 minute, 1 hour, or 1 day respectively.</li></ul>
