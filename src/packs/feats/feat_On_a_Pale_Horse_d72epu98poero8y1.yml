      <p>You have been gained a spectral, undying steed, either as a gift from
      your patron, or manifested from your own undying will.</p><ul><li>You know
      the @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.oqsv50k3glkbk7z2]{Find
      Steed} spell as a bonus warlock spell that does not count against your
      spells known. You may cast it once per short or long rest without
      expending spell points or a spell slot, and you cast it at 5th level when
      doing so. &nbsp;Its type is undead rather than fey, fiend, or celestial,
      it is resistant to necrotic damage and damage from non-magical weapons,
      and while riding it you gain resistance to necrotic damage or immunity if
      you are already resistant. &nbsp;If your steed makes an attack roll, it
      uses your spell attack bonus in place of it's normal attack bonus, and if
      it hits with an attack while you are mounted on it you may have it deliver
      a Divine Smite just as if you had delivered it yourself using your Divine
      Smite feature (expending one of your uses). If you are able to empower
      your smites, you may choose to empower it as normal. &nbsp;Your steed is
      immune to Turn Undead so long as you are riding it.</li><li>You may expend
      points from your Lay on Hands pool up to your proficiency bonus and touch
      your steed, and when doing so your steed gains temporary hit points equal
      to the number of points expended x your herald+warlock level. &nbsp;Once
      you have done so, you may not do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</li></ul>
