      <p>Psionics are, in many ways, the magic of the mind. &nbsp;Some witches,
      particularly those with an interest in dreams and the realms conjured
      within them, take to honing these abilities within themselves along with
      more traditional spellcasting, while some espers turn to magical practice
      in order to deepen their understanding of their abilities, and such
      mystics often find witches most welcoming. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your Intelligence score, to a
      maximum value of 20.</li><li>If your witch spellcasting ability modifier
      is not Intelligence, you may change it to Intelligence.</li><li>You add
      all spells from the psychic and telepathy spell schools to your witch
      spell list.</li><li>You may expend a psi die as a bonus action to regain a
      spell slot of 3rd level or lower. Such a die is automatically expended and
      not rolled. &nbsp;Once you have done so, you may not do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</li><li>You gain the Dreamwalker noetic if
      you do not already have it, or a different noetic if you do.</li></ul>
