      <p>It is nearly impossible to conceal something you are looking for from
      you, and your prowess at finding the true nature of supernatural threats
      is a potent reassurance to those you protect.&nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You no longer choose which enemy types your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.01szspr1nunp0lql]{Divine
      Sense} detects; it automatically detects all three sets by default. If you
      have some other benefit that grants you more than three choices, pick
      three times.</p></li><li><p>You gain the following additional
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.c6aiq8cd90fo3ry1]{Divine
      Smite} options:</p></li></ul><ul><li style="list-style-type:
      none;"><ul><li><strong>Purifying Smite.&nbsp;</strong>If a creature you
      strike with your smite is possessed by another creature or controlled by a
      parasite, the damage (including the weapon damage from this attack and
      your sneak attack, if applicable) is done directly to the controlling or
      possessing creature instead of to the host, which must make a Charisma
      save against a DC of your spell save DC or half the damage done by the
      attack (whichever is highest) to remain in the host. A creature that fails
      is immediately forced out of the host body and stunned until the end of
      its next turn. If the damage is enough to kill the possessing or
      controlling creature, it is first ejected and then
      dies.</li><li><strong>Lunar Smite. </strong>If the creature you strike
      with your smite is a shapeshifter, it must make a Constitution save
      against a DC of your spell save DC or half the damage done by the attack
      (whichever is highest) or revert to its true form. If the space it
      currently occupies is not large enough to hold its true form, the creature
      takes a number of d6s of force damage equal to your proficiency bonus and
      is stunned until the end of its next round.</li></ul></li></ul>
