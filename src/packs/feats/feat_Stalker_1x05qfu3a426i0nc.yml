      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum
      of 20.</p></li><li><p>If you are not proficient with the Stealth skill,
      you become proficient now, and you gain an expertise die in Stealth. Your
      expertise die in Stealth can be upgraded from a d8 to a d10 in this
      way.</p></li><li><p>You acquire the Stealth skill specialty of your
      choice.</p></li><li><p>You can use your Sneak Attack ability with any
      one-handed melee weapon, not only ones with the finesse
      property.</p></li><li><p>If you have been in a city for at least a week
      continuously, you gain the benefits of your Favored Terrain feature while
