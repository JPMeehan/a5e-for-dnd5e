      <p>If you possess the Sacred Aura or Improved Sacred Aura abilities, the
      radius of those auras is equal to your Commanding Presence aura. If you do
      not possess either ability, you may spend 4 exertion points to gain the
      benefit of one aura from the Sacred Aura herald ability. This aura lasts
      until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>The radius of your Commanding
      Presence increases by 10 feet.</p>
