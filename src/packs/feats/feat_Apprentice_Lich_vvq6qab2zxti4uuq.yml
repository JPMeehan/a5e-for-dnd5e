      <p>Your flesh withers, but your mind is sharper than ever. You have taken
      the first steps on the road to lichdom. You forsake your name and take on
      a title or honorific to refer to yourself with, and you construct a soul
      vessel.</p><ul><li>Your appearance becomes gaunt and wan, you need only
      half as much sleep and food as normal, and the duration you can hold your
      breath for doubles.</li><li>You gain resistance to necrotic damage (if you
      are already resistant to necrotic damage, you gain immunity
      instead).</li><li>You gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet if you do
      not have it, or add 30 feet to the range of existing
      darkvision.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><em>Soul Vessel. </em></strong>You gain
      a soul vessel, a small magical trinket that contains your soul. While your
      soul vessel is intact and you are within 100 feet of it, you gain
      advantage on death saving throws.</li><li>If your soul vessel (which has
      AC 15 and 40 hit points, regardless of its nature) is destroyed, you can
      create a new one in a ritual taking 8 hours and costing 250
      gp.</li><li><strong><em>Forbidden Knowledge. </em></strong>You learn a new
      cantrip, 1st-level spell, 2nd-level spell, and 3rd-level spell. The spells
      must be ones from the <em>necromancy</em>, <em>affliction</em>,
      <em>knowledge</em>, <em>necrotic</em>, <em>psychic</em>, or <em>scrying
      </em>schools.&nbsp;These spells do not count against the spells you know
      or can have prepared, and they always count as being prepared. These
      spells are added to your class's spell list for you; if you have more than
      one spellcasting class, you choose which list to add them to.</li></ul>
