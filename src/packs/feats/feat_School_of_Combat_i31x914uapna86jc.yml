      <p>Having reached the limit of what you can learn about your chosen
      weapon, you turn yourself instead to passing on what you have learned to
      eager students, and gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1
      bonus to your choice of your Intelligence, Strength, or Dexterity score,
      to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain the fighter's
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.vh4d1qw05cc4627a]{Martial
      Legacy} ability. &nbsp;The number of hours required to teach a maneuver to
      another creature is reduced to 8 - your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1),
      and the bonus maneuver you teach them does not count against their list of
      maneuvers known, though all other normal limits stand. &nbsp;You may also
      retrain them by spending the same amount of time to teach them a different
      maneuver, replacing the one you previously taught them. &nbsp;When a
      creature you can see uses a maneuver you taught them, you gain
      inspiration. &nbsp;You may only gain inspiration in this way once per long
      rest per creature you have taught, and to qualify if the maneuver involves
      one or more attacks they must hit with at least one, and if it does not
      involve any attack rolls but does force an opponent to make a saving
      throw, that creature must fail the save. &nbsp;You may spend inspiration
      along with a hit die to regain exertion, and when you do so it only takes
      a bonus action, not one minute, and you automatically roll the maximum for
      the amount of exertion regained.</li></ul>
