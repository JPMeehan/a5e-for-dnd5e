      <p>You are perhaps the rawest, purest expression of psionics fueled by
      pure, raw passion and emotions. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You may enter a Rage and a state of Unfettered
      Emotions as part of the same bonus action, expending uses of these
      abilities as normal. &nbsp;If you do so you gain the benefit of both
      abilities, and the temporary hit points granted by your Unfettered
      Emotions are rage hit points instead. You may also add half your esper
      level to your berserker level for the purpose of the maximum number of
      rage hit points you may have at one time, but only while in both a rage
      and a state of Unfettered Emotions, as well as the number of times you can
      rage per long rest.</li><li>If you have Infectious Fury you may choose to
      grant bonded creatures the benefits of Unfettered Emotions instead of
      rage, but only if you are entering both states yourself.</li><li>If you
      have Unfettered Influence, it lasts for the normal duration of 1 minute,
      but only if you are also raging.</li></ul>
