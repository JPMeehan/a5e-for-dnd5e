      <p>Your visions of the future are unclear, but by your word these omens
      can mean hope or despair.</p><p>You learn the Preach Despair and Preach
      Hope battle hymns. These special battle hymns can only be performed while
      you are using your voice Art Specialty as a spell
      focus.</p><p><strong><em>Preach Despair.</em></strong> A hostile creature
      within 60 feet of you suffers a level of strife. Creatures with an
      opposite alignment from yours or that worship a greater entity that has an
      opposite alignment suffer two levels of strife instead. A creature cannot
      suffer more than two levels of strife from Preach Despair in the same 24
      hours.</p><p><strong><em>Preach Hope. </em></strong>Ally creatures within
      60 feet gain advantage on saving throws. When the battle hymn ends, allies
      within 30 feet of you remove one level of strife. An ally that shares your
      alignment or worships a greater entity removes two levels of strife
      instead.</p>
