      <p>A pound of black powder inside a wooden shell with a fuse can make a
      simple but potent explosive. You can use an action to set and light one or
      more black powder charges which explode at the beginning of your next
      turn. Any creatures or objects within 10 feet of the exploding charge must
      make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage and 1d6 fire
      damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Increase the
      explosion’s damage by 1d6 force and 1d6 fire for each doubling of the
      number of charges set beyond the first. For example, 4 black powder
      charges deal 3d6 force and 3d6 fire damage, 8 black powder charges deal
      4d6 force and 4d6 fire damage, 32 black powder charges deal 6d6 force
      damage and 6d6 fire damage, and so on.</p><p>For each charge beyond the
      first, the area increases as follows: 2 charges—20-foot radius, 4
      charges—30-foot radius, 8 charges—40-foot radius, 16 charges—50-foot
      radius, 32 charges— 60-foot radius. Black powder charges become useless
      and are destroyed when submerged in water or left exposed to rain.</p>
