      <p>You have slipped over from half-living into truly undead, but that
      comes with additional power and resiliency. What you do with that is up to
      you.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your creature
      type is now Undead in addition to any others you
      possess.</p></li><li><p>Your wrappings only burn for a minute when
      ignited, regardless of action you or your allies take, and you can
      extinguish ongoing fire damage on yourself as a bonus
      action.</p></li><li><p>You no longer need to eat, breathe, or sleep at
      all.&nbsp;You must still finish a long rest to recharge limited use
      features and regain spell slots and hit dice.</p></li><li><p>You are
      immune to poison damage.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on saves to
      avoid the charmed, frightened, and paralyzed conditions and to avoid
      acquiring levels of fatigue.</p></li></ul>
