      <p>There are those who walk the line between life and death, bound by
      oaths that transcend even mortality. These are death knights. Some are
      blackguards of the foulest sort, those who betrayed their oaths in life
      and so were damned to eternal unlife as punishment. &nbsp;Others are
      solemn guardians or avenging revenants, those whose duties are so strong
      they persist beyond the end of their natural life, earning a reprieve from
      Death itself, and the power and knowledge to command the grave. &nbsp;You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice
      of your Strength or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>If
      your warlock spellcasting ability is not Charisma, you may change it to
      Charisma.</li><li>You divine smite ability deals necrotic damage rather
      than radiant, as does the Divine Warrior ability if you have
      it.</li><li>You may apply a Divine Smite to a successful attack with
      either Eldritch Scythe or Eldritch Ray in addition to a weapon
      attack.</li><li>Your Divine Sense ability always detects undead in
      addition to the other set creature types you have chosen, and if you
      choose aberrations and undead then undead have disadvantage on saving
      throws against your Divine Sense.</li><li>You gain the Turn Undead cleric
      feature with the Command Undead Empower Turning ability as an additional
      Channel Divinity option, except you may not turn undead, only command
      them.</li></ul>
