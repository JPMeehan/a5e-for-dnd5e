      <p>You have reached greater heights of both covert skill and physical
      prowess, and you may have become a figure of fearful legend along the way.
      Or perhaps you are so quiet and so thorough that no one even knows to be
      afraid. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>When you use <em>Long
      Step to Dash</em>, you can use the Hide action at the end of your
      movement.</li><li>When you would gain a <em>Skill Trick</em> or
      <em>Practiced Technique</em>, you can choose freely from either
      list.</li><li>Half your adept levels count as rogue levels for the purpose
      of determining the damage of your <em>Sneak Attack</em>
      feature.</li><li>Half your rogue levels count as adept levels for the
      purpose of gaining the <em>Extra Attack</em> feature.</li><li>When you
      make a ranged attack with a Throwing Dagger, you can draw another Throwing
      Dagger as part of the attack, allowing you to throw multiple daggers on
      your turn if you have <em>Extra Attack</em>.</li></ul>
