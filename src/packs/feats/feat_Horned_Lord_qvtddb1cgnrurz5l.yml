  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Horned Lords get their name from their distinctive helms, which
      normally feature horns or antlers from wild beasts. They are a bridge
      between the structures of power that make both the civilized world and the
      natural world run, and they can utilize these connections to call forth
      the armies of nature to aid their mortal forces. As one of these powerful
      figures, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You become
      proficient with metal, light, and medium armor, shields, and helms. You
      may wear these protective items without violating your druidic oaths or
      interfering with your druid class features.</p></li><li><p>You gain
      proficiency with one combat tradition from either Adamant Mountain or
      Tooth and Claw. For you it counts as a marshal combat
      tradition.</p></li><li><p>Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.sygit0xifd4lbg3g]{Natural
      Demeanor} class feature provides both the Leyline Awareness and A Way With
      Animals benefits. In addition, these benefits also extend to Plant
      creatures. A Beast or Plant creature encountering you for the first time
      begins with an attitude toward you one step higher than normal. (Hostile
      creatures are indifferent, indifferent creatures are friendly, friendly
      creatures remain friendly.)</p></li></ul>
