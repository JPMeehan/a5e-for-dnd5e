    value: >-
      <p>With a blade’s sweep you pull and spin the arcane power, surrounding
      yourself in a cyclone of arcane energy as your spell's power tries to
      match the speed of your sword.</p><p>Whenever you use your reaction to
      cast a spell through a melee weapon attack using bladechanting, you may
      choose up to a number of additional targets for that spell equal to the
      spell level of the spell slot used to cast it. These additional targets
      must all be within 10 feet of you and are each treated as if they were the
      spell’s original target.</p>
