      of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score, to a maximum value of
      20.</li><li>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a
      spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you regain an artifact
      charge.</li><li>You gain an additional benefit based on your Bonded
      Artifact type:<ul><li>If your Bonded Artifact is a weapon of power, it
      counts as being adamantine and so does any other weapon you wield while it
      is in your possession.</li><li>If your Bonded Artifact is an armor of
      power, choose radiant or necrotic damage when you take this feat. You are
      immune to the selected damage type when you are wearing your Bonded
      Artifact.</li><li>If your Bonded Artifact is a font of power, choose a
      6th-level spell from the cleric list. You can cast the spell once per long
      rest without using a spell slot.</li></ul></li><li>Your Wielder levels
      count as Cleric levels for the purpose of determining access to and the
      effects of the Providence feature.</li></ul>
