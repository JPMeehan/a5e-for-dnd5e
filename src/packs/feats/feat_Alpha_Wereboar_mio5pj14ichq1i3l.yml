      <p>You have completely mastered the boar within. You can transform one
      additional time without suffering a level of fatigue. When you choose to
      tame the beast in an involuntary transformation, roll 1d8; you gain
      control over that many hours. While you are transformed, you gain the
      following features.</p><p><strong>Deadly Tusks</strong>. The damage of
      your tusks increases to 1d8.</p><p><strong>Full Moon Defense</strong>. You
      gain immunity against slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage from
      weapons that are not magical or silvered.</p><p><strong>Full Moon
      Ferocity</strong>. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a tusks
      attack, you regain your use of the Relentless feature. Once you use this
      feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
