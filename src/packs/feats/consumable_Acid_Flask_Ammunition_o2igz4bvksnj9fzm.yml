      <p>You can use an action to splash the contents of this vial onto a target
      within 5 feet of you, or throw the vial up to 20 feet where it shatters on
      impact. In either case, make a ranged weapon attack against the target,
      treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d4
      ongoing acid damage. This damage persists for 3 rounds. A creature ends
      all ongoing damage from mundane acid by using its action to wipe away the
      corrosive liquid.</p>
