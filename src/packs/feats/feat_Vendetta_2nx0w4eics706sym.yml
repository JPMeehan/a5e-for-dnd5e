  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Something or someone has had a profound impact on your life—and earned
      your unending rancor. You are utterly dedicated to defeating the source of
      your vendetta, often an organization like a thieves’ guild, the minions of
      a dreadful foe like a dragon or lich, or the army of a powerful ruler like
      a tyrant king. You gain an expertise die on attack rolls and initiative
      checks made against creatures that are part of your vendetta, and when
      making a saving throw to resist an attack, feature, maneuver, spell, or
      trait from a creature that is part of your vendetta. Whether or not a
      creature is part of your vendetta is at the Narrator’s discretion.</p>
