    value: >-
      <p>You are capable of awe-inspiring leadership, and that leadership gives
      your allies strength. When you spend 10 minutes speaking inspirationally,
      you can choose up to 6 friendly creatures (including yourself) within 30
      feet that can hear and understand you. Each creature gains temporary hit
      points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier. A creature canâ€™t gain
      temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a short or
      long rest.</p>
