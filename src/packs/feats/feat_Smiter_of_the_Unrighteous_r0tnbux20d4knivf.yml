      <p>You channel all of your divinely inspired wrath into your blows to
      smite any who would dare stand against you. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You may spend 1 exertion point to apply an Empowered
      Smite effect to a Divine Smite, even if you do not have that ability. If
      you have the Greater Empowered Smite ability, you may apply one of those
      effects by spending 2 exertion points instead.</li><li>While raging, you
      gain the Aura of Smiting Improved Sacred Aura option, even if you do not
      have the Sacred Aura or Improved Sacred Aura abilities. &nbsp;If you do
      have the Improved Sacred Aura ability and chose a different option, both
      auras are active while raging, and if you chose Aura of Smiting as your
      Improved Sacred Aura option then while raging affected creatures other
      than you increase their critical hit range with weapons by 1 to a maximum
      of 17-20. &nbsp;For the purpose of Aura of Smiting, your effective herald
      level is your herald+berserker level.</li><li>Finally, if you reduce a
      creature with a CR of your level/3 or higher, minimum 4, to 0 hit points
      while raging, you regain a use of divine smite. &nbsp;You may only do so
      once per rage.</li></ul>
