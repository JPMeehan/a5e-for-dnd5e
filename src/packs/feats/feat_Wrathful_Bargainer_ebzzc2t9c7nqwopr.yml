      <p>You have paired focused anger with a powerful magical pact. These may
      be two sides of the same coin or from separate places, but you&rsquo;ve
      learned to combine them. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your Strength score or the ability score you chose
      as your warlock spellcasting ability increases by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</p></li><li><p>While you are raging, the range of your Eldritch Blast
      increases. The ranges of Eldritch Ray and Eldritch Disturbance increase by
      30 feet, and Eldritch Scythe and Eldritch Whip increase by
      5.</p></li><li><p>You gain proficiency with the Arcana skill if you do not
      already have it and gain an expertise die if you do. You make saves
      against effects that would inflict levels of Strife on you with
      advantage.</p></li><li><p>You learn the following Furious Critical option,
      which does not count against your Furious Critical options known:
