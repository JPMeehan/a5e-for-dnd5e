      <p>Your hard work, studies, and instruction have unlocked new depths
      within the magic that flows through your veins, giving an unparalleled
      ability to manipulate the raw underlying essence of magic. You gain one of
      the following manifestation options depending on which option you chose
      for your Witch Magic feature.</p><ul><li><strong>White Magic.</strong>
      Higher Arcanum (radiant): &nbsp;When you cast a spell that deals radiant
      damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see
      within 60 feet. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6
      &times; the spell&rsquo;s level, or half that amount and also cures any
      diseases they are suffering from and removes any of the following
      conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or
      poisoned.</li><li><strong>Black Magic.</strong> Lower Arcanum (necrotic):
      When you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, you may spend 2 sorcery
      points and choose one creature you can see. &nbsp;If the creature takes
      necrotic damage from the spell, they reduce their maximum hit points by an
      amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt and must make a constitution
      saving throw against your spell save DC. &nbsp;On a failure, they gain 1d4
      strife or fatigue levels (your choice). &nbsp;Once you successfully
      inflict fatigue or strife on a creature using this manifestation you may
      not do so again in a single 24 hour period, though you may apply both
      fatigue and strife to them on separate casts.</li><li><strong>Gray
      Magic.</strong> Balanced Arcanum (force): When you cast a spell that deals
      force damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points and choose one creature you
      can see. If the creature takes force damage from the spell it makes an
      Strength saving throw or is pushed 10ft directly away from you, knocked
      prone, or both. &nbsp;On a critical failure or a failure by 5 or more they
      are also stunned until the end of their next turn.</li></ul><p>You also
      upgrade one of your standard sorcerer manifestations to its evolved
      form.</p>
