      <p>You are so at home in the wilds and with the gifts of your divine
      patron that you have come to think of all the world as a temple. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom score increases by +1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li>You ignore the speed penalty from all forms of
      difficult terrain. If there is an additional effect such as damage or
      requiring a save to avoid falling prone, it affects you as
      normal.</li><li>When you acquire this feat, choose a creature type from
      the following list: <em>Aberrations</em>, <em>Celestials</em>,
      <em>Fey</em>, <em>Fiends</em>, or <em>Undead</em>. The chosen creature
      type always counts as your studied adversary in addition to your normal
      choice.</li><li>When you cast a cleric spell, if you have no spell slots
      remaining, you immediately gain 4 points of exertion and 2 uses of Trained
      Accuracy. Once you have used this benefit, you can&rsquo;t do so again
      until you finish a long rest.</li></ul>
