      <p>Your elemental power increases, seeping from your body and affecting
      your surrounding when rage takes you.&nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>While you are raging, you leave a trail of energized
      footprints behind when you move. Each space you move through gains an
      elemental charge. Creatures moving through the space must make a
      Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC or take 1d6 points of a
      type of damage your Elemental Blast can do. The effect then ends on the
      space. A space also loses its charge when your rage ends or if you move
      more than 30 feet away from it. A space can only hold one charge of this
      type at a time.</li><li>You can spend 3 spell points to enter a
      rage.</li><li>While you are raging, you can spend an additional use of
      your rage to erupt with elemental energies. Creatures within 10 feet of
      you must make a Dexterity save against your maneuver DC or take 2d10
      points of damage of a type your Elemental Blast can do and be pushed 10
      feet away from you. Creatures that succeed on their save take half damage
      and are not pushed.</li></ul>
