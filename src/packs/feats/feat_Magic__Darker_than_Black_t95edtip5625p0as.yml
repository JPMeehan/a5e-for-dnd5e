      <p>Your mastery of the blackest of magics is complete. &nbsp;It only
      remains to be seen if you can salvage and repurpose this rotten fruit, or
      if you will be infected and consumed by it. You gain the following
      abilities:</p><ul><li>Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level through
      5th-level from any of the sub schools listed under Black Magic, treat it
      as if it were one level higher than you cast it at. This stacks with any
      bonus gained from Blood Magic on Evil spells.</li><li>You may cast the
      <em>summon fiend</em> spell at 4th-level once per long rest without
      spending a spell slot or spell points. &nbsp;If your warlock level is 7 or
      higher you also treat it as a warlock spell known that does not count
      against your spells known, and if your witch level is 7 or higher you
      treat it as a witch spell that is always prepared and does not count
      against your prepared spells.</li></ul>
