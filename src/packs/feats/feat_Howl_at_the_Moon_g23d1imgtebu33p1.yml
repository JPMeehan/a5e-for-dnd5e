      <p>Increase your Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p><p>You can
      <em>speak with animals</em> (as the spell) of the same type as your curse
      (bears for a wereboar, boars for a wereboar, and so on). You can also cast
      <em>animal friendship</em> without spending material components, but are
      only able to target animals of the same type as your curse. Once you have
      used this feature to cast <em>animal friendship</em>, you canâ€™t use it
      again until you finish a long rest. In addition, you have advantage on
      Charisma checks made against animals when the moon is full.</p>
