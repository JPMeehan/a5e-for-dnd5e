      <p>You have learned to tame the boar rampaging within you since
      contracting lycanthropy. On full moon nights you involuntarily change into
      a boar or boar-humanoid hybrid. While you are transformed, you gain the
      following features.</p><p><strong><em>Fleet of Foot.</em></strong> Your
      Speed increases by 10 feet.</p><p><strong><em>Relentless.</em></strong>
      Once between long rests when you take damage that would reduce you to 0
      hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit
      point.</p><p><strong><em>Tusks.</em></strong> You gain tusk natural
      weapons you are proficient with. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength
      for the attack rolls of your tusks. On a hit, your tusks deal slashing
      damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier
      (whichever is highest).</p>
