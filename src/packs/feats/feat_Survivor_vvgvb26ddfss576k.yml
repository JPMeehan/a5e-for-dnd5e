      <p>You use every last ounce of energy to survive, even in the worst of
      circumstances.</p><ul><li><p>When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points, you can use your reaction to move up to your Speed before falling
      unconscious. Moving in this way doesn’t provoke opportunity
      attacks.</p></li><li><p>On the first turn that you start with 0 hit points
      and must make a death saving throw, you make that saving throw with
      advantage.</p></li><li><p>When you take massive damage that would kill you
      instantly, you can use your reaction to make a death saving throw. If the
      saving throw succeeds, you instead fall unconscious and are
      dying.</p></li><li><p>Medicine checks made to stabilize you have
      advantage.</p></li><li><p>When a creature successfully stabilizes you, at
      the start of your next turn you regain 1 hit point. Once you have used
      this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long
      rest.</p></li></ul>
