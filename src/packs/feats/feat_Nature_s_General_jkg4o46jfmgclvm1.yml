      <p>Your integration of military and natural skills has reached its
      pinnacle, and those around you benefit.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Certain types of followers become infused with the power of nature.
      When you take this feat, choose three of these benefits. Whenever your
      proficiency bonus increases, choose one more.

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>A Diviner follower, once they become seasoned, can also cast spells
      from the druid list.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>An Apothecary follower may treat a number of allies equal to half your
      proficiency bonus instead of just one.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>The first Sage follower you gain is proficient in Nature as well as
      their normal specialized skill of choice (which must be a skill other than
      nature).</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>If you have Footpad followers, they can use their first trait in
      natural surroundings. This represents finding rare or expensive things
      that occur naturally such as rare herbs, precious stones, gourmet
      mushrooms, and so on.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>If you have Teamster followers, they may affect up to 6 creatures
      instead of up to 4.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>If you have
      the@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.1tu6oun2uo9n9cer]{Lay of
      the Land} feature, its range extends to three miles and its exertion cost
      drops to 1.</p>

      </li>

      <li>Any Encampment, Menagerie, or Sacred Grove strongholds you build can
      be built at Average quality for the price of building them at Frugal
      quality.</li>

      </ul>
