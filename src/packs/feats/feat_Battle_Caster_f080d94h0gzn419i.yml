      <p>You have learned to wield magic effectively even in the chaos of
      combat. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain a 1d6
      expertise die on concentration checks to maintain spells you have
      cast.</p></li><li><p>You can perform the seen components of your spells
      while using a weapon or shield with your hands.</p></li><li><p>Instead of
      making an opportunity attack with a weapon, you may use your reaction to
      cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action at the creature instead. The
      spell must be one that only targets that creature.</p></li></ul>
