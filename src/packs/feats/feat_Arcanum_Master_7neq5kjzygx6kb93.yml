    value: >-
      <p>With a wellspring of magic flowing from their veins and a divine
      understanding of all magic, the mystic arcanist can reorder magic to suit
      their will. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you may choose
      the type of damage that spell deals and the appearance of the
      spell&rsquo;s effects. For example,
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.c9itysok7lr2ai51]{Scorching Rays}
      made to deal cold damage might look like icicle spears, a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.n7vv8e7phkfc513j]{Fireball} that deals
      radiant damage may appear to be an explosive host of warrior angels, and a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.idachh0qpbbyne7c]{Lightning Bolt} that
      deals psychic damage may be a strange color or accompanied by unnatural
      howls.</p>
