      <p>You have become a truly inspiring leader, resilient, inspirational, and
      deadly to your foes. You are almost certainly loved by your allies and a
      force of terror to your enemies. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You become proficient with either Wisdom or
      Dexterity saving throws.</p></li><li><p>When you use Mark Foe, you can
      spend a use of Bardic Inspiration to enhance it in one of the following
      ways:</p><ul><li><p>Its range increases to 120 feet for this
      use.</p></li><li><p>The target is outlined in a <em>faerie fire</em>
      effect until the start of your next turn.</p></li><li>The target takes an
      additional 1d4 psychic damage from weapon attacks or spells from you or
      your allies.</li></ul></li><li>Your Battle Hymn feature&rsquo;s range
      increases to the range of your Commanding Presence.</li><li><p>When you
      choose the targets for a Battle Hymn, you can cause all creatures affected
      by it to either heal a number of hit points equal to your bardic
      inspiration die or take an equal amount of psychic damage. Once you have
      used this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p></li></ul>
