      <p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">You have become a truly inspiring
      leader, resilient, inspirational, and deadly to your foes. You are almost
      certainly loved by your allies and a force of terror to your enemies.
      </span>You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>You become proficient with either Wisdom or Dexterity saving
      throws.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">When you use Mark Foe, you can spend a
      use of Bardic Inspiration to enhance it in one of the following
      ways:</span></p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>Its range increases to 120 feet for this use.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>The target is outlined in a <em>faerie fire</em> effect until the start
      of your next turn.</p>

      </li>

      <li>The target takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage from weapon attacks
      or spells from you or your allies.</li>

      </ul>

      </li>

      <li><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Your Battle Hymn feature&rsquo;s
      range increases to the range of your Commanding Presence.</span></li>

      <li>

      <p>When you choose the targets for a Battle Hymn, you can cause all
      creatures affected by it to either heal a number of hit points equal to
      your bardic inspiration die or take an equal amount of psychic damage.
      Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>
