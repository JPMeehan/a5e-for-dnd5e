      <p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">You become even harder to find, able
      to slip unseen into even well-guarded locations. You gain the following
      benefits:</span></p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>You gain an expertise die to Stealth. Your expertise die in Stealth can
      be upgraded from a d8 to a d10 or from a d10 to a d12 in this way.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You acquire an additional Stealth skill specialty of your choice.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You may switch weapons without spending an action as long as both
      weapons are ranged or lack the two-handed property.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You leave virtually no trace of your passage. Attempts to detect your
      presence in an area you have visited with Investigation or Perception
      checks are made at disadvantage, as are attempts to track you with
      Survival.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>When you apply Hunter&rsquo;s Target, you become invisible until the
      beginning of your next turn. When you use Swift Feet, you become immune to
      non-magical difficult terrain for the duration of the ability.</p>

      </li>
