    value: >-
      <p>You gain a ritual book containing spells that you can cast as rituals
      while holding it.</p><p>Choose one of the following classes: bard, cleric,
      druid, herald, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. When you acquire this feat,
      you create a ritual book holding two 1st-level spells of your choice from
      that class’ spell list. These spells must have the ritual tag. The class
      you choose also determines your spellcasting ability for these spells:
      Intelligence for wizard, Wisdom for cleric or druid, Charisma for bard,
      herald, or sorcerer, or your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      for warlock.</p><p>If you come across a spell with the ritual tag in
      written form (like on a <em>spell scroll</em> or in a wizard’s spellbook),
      you can add it to your ritual book if the spell is on the spell list for
      the class you chose and its level is no higher than half your level
      (rounded up). Copying the spell into your ritual book costs 50 gold per
      level of the spell and takes 2 hours per spell level.</p>
