      <p>You have learned to further combine your elemental prowess with the use
      of your bonded artifact.&nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Half of your elementalist levels count as wielder
      levels for the purpose of gaining access to the Extra Attack and
      Spellsword features.</li><li>Half of your wielder levels count as
      elementalist levels for the purpose of determining the damage done by your
      elemental blast.</li><li>You can use an element you have affinity for to
      recharge your Artifact of power in an emergency. If you are out of both
      artifact charges and spell points, you can rest your bonded artifact in an
      element you have affinity with for one minute to regain artifact charges
      equal to your proficiency bonus (air or water must be in motion; the
      artifact must be held aloft in high winds or submerged in running water to
      recharge). Once you have used this benefit, you can&rsquo;t do so again
      until you finish a short or long rest.</li></ul>
