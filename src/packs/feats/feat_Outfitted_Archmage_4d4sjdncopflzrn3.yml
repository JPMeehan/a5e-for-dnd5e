      <p>You have become exceptionally powerful from your mixing of artifice and
      traditional magical scholarship.&nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Intelligence increases by +1, to a maximum of
      20.</li><li>Half of your Wizard levels count as Artificer levels for the
      purpose of determining your infusion limit.</li><li>You can deactivate an
      infusion you have active during a short rest to gain an additional use of
      Arcane Recovery. When you deactivate an infusion this way, your infusion
      limit decreases by 1 until you finish a long rest.</li><li>The costs (time
      and materials) for both scribing spells into your spellbook and creating
      spell inventions are halved.</li></ul>
