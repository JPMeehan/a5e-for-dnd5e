    value: >-
      <p>Your wrath bursts the dams of even your connection with nature,
      outpouring from you and your stampede like a plague of fury.</p><p>While
      raging, you and any creatures benefiting from your Living Stampede emit
      5-foot auras of fury. When a creature other than you or your allies enters
      a fury aura or starts its turn there it makes a Wisdom saving throw
      against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature becomes
      confused, except instead of rolling to determine their actions as normal
      for the confused condition, they are always considered to have rolled the
      7 or 8 result. At the end of each of a confused creatureâ€™s turns it
      repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a
      creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to it for
      the remainder of your rage.</p>
