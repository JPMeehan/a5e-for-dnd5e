      <p>You have studied both the workings of traditional magic and magic items
      and can sometimes combine them.&nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Intelligence increases by +1, to a maximum of
      20.</li><li>Choose a number of Artificer spells equal to your Intelligence
      modifier. You learn them as Wizard spells and add them to your spellbook,
      even if they aren&rsquo;t normally on the Wizard list. If they are not on
      the normal Wizard list, other Wizards cannot copy them from your
      spellbook.</li><li>When you use Arcane Recovery, you can choose to repair
      a spell invention at the cost of a spell slot of the level of spell tied
      to it. For example, repairing a spell invention that casts blur would
      count as recovering a 2nd-level spell slot. You may only repair one spell
      invention this way per use of Arcane Recovery.</li></ul>
