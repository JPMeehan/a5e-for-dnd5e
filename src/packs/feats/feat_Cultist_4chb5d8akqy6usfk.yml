      <p>You have walked your own unconventional path for so long that you are
      now entirely outside of traditional structures.</p><p>You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your Pact Boon
      improves.</p></li><li><p>If you have <strong style="font-size:
      10.5pt;"><em>Pact of the Blade</em></strong>, your weapon attacks with
      your pact weapon deal bonus radiant or necrotic damage (choose when you
      use this ability) equal to your proficiency bonus.</p></li><li><p>If you
      have <strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Pact of the
      Chain</em></strong>, you may have any spell with a range of self that you
      cast originate from your familiar instead of from you.</p></li><li><p>If
      you have <strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Pact of the
      Tome</em></strong>, you may transform your Book of Shadows into a copy of
      any other non-magical book you have read as a bonus action. In addition,
      choose 3 spells of 3rd level or lower from classes you do not have levels
      in. Each spell must be from a different class&rsquo;s list. While you have
      your book of shadows, these spells count as warlock spells for you and do
      not count against your spells known.</p></li><li><p>You gain an additional
      secret of arcana and an additional sign of faith. Neither counts against
      the maximum number of its respective type you can know.</p></li></ul>
