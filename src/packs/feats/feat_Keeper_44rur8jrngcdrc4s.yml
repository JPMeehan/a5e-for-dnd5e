      <p>Warlocks are perhaps best known, or at least best stereotyped, for
      their willingness to engage in dangerous bargains in exchange for power.
      &nbsp;But for some, a different more subtle call is far more alluring: not
      forbidden power, but forbidden knowledge. &nbsp;Keepers are those who seek
      out to know all there is to know about dark, dangerous, or forbidden
      topics, some for personal gain, some to keep such knowledge safe from the
      unwise, or the innocent safe from that knowledge. &nbsp;All enter into
      dealings with powerful supernatural beings, gambling their souls to
      satiate their curiosity. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You may change your warlock spellcasting modifier to
      intelligence if it isn't already.</li><li>You gain the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.2dp9b4a11fuxjwbc]{Pact of the
      Tome} if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you do you gain the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.tguawbanmxly12iz]{Book of
      Ancient Secrets} secret of arcana instead.</li><li>While you possess and
      can reference your pact tome, you gain an expertise die on all
      intelligence based skill checks. &nbsp;Furthermore you may study your tome
      when taking a short or long rest. &nbsp;At the end of the rest you gain
      proficiency with a skill of your choice from the warlock or scholar list,
      and may always use intelligence on checks with the chosen skill.</li></ul>
