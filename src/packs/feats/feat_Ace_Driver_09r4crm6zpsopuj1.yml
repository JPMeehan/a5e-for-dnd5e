      <p>You are a virtuoso of driving and piloting vehicles, able to push them
      beyond their normal limits and maneuver them with fluid grace through
      hazardous situations. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>You gain an expertise die on ability checks made to drive or pilot a
      vehicle.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>While piloting a vehicle, you can use your reaction to take the brake
      or maneuver vehicle actions.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>A vehicle you load can carry 25% more cargo than normal.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Vehicles you are piloting only suffer a malfunction when reduced to 25%
      of their hit points, not 50%. In addition, when the vehicle does suffer a
      malfunction, you roll twice on the maneuver table and choose which die to
      use for the result.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Vehicles you are piloting gain a bonus to their Armor Class equal to
      half your proficiency bonus.</p>

      </li>

      <li>When you Brake, you can choose to immediately stop the vehicle without
      traveling half of its movement speed directly forward.</li>
