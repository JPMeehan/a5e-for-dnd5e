      <p>You have learned to draw upon the power of your bonded artifact to aid
      in your own creations.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>When one of your spell inventions would fizzle, you can spend artifact
      charges sufficient to cast the level of spell it contains. The spell
      invention does nothing this turn, but does not stop working and can be
      used normally without needing to be repaired.</li>

      <li>When you use
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.f2syblzgm6at7i7q]{Tactical
      Chemistry}, you can spend an artifact charge to stabilize the item for a
      number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus before it loses
      potency.</li>

      <li>Half of your artificer levels count as wielder levels for the purpose
      of gaining access to the Extra Attack and Spellsword features.</li>

      </ul>
