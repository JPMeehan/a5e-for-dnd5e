      <p>When you rage, you seethe with elemental energies, and woe betide those
      who would challenge you.&nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Half your berserker levels count as elementalist
      levels for the purpose of what Elemental Defense options you have access
      to.</li><li>When you rage, choose a damage type your Elemental Blast can
      deal. While you are raging, you emit an aura of elemental energy around
      yourself. Creatures that enter or begin their turns within 5 feet of you
      must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC or take 2d6
      points of the chosen damage type, or half as much on a successful
      save.</li><li>While you are raging, your berserker levels count as
      elementalist levels for the purpose of determining how much damage your
      Elemental Blast does.</li></ul>
