      have honed this weapon to a razor edge. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain an additional adept dance Focus Feature, or
      a Focus Feature that requires dances.</li><li>You may add 1/2 your bard
      level to your adept level for the purpose of the extra attack feature, as
      well as qualifying for the Additional Attack Focus Feature.<br>While in
      your war dance, your unarmed strikes and adept weapon attacks deal
      additional damage equal to your charisma modifier. &nbsp;</li><li>When you
      reduce a creature to 0 hit points while in your War Dance, you may use
      your reaction to regain a use of bardic inspiration. &nbsp;Once you have
      done so, you may not do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</li></ul>
