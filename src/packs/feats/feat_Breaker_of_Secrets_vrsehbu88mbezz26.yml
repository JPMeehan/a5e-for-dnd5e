      <p>Your skill at ferreting out supernatural threats grows, allowing you to

      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have advantage on all saving throws against
      spells of the Illusion and Enchantment schools.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.01szspr1nunp0lql]{Divine
      Sense} now detects the presence of any creature with an alignment trait
      and reveals that alignment to you.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The range of your
      Divine Sense increases to 50 feet.</p></li><li><p>You gain an expertise
      die on Insight, Investigation, Arcana, Medicine, and Perception checks to
      determine if a creature&rsquo;s actions are being controlled by another
      creature (such as via a parasite, possession, or a dominating spell or
      effect). The same applies when assessing the remains of a dead creature,
      up to 48 hours after death. The maximum expertise die size for such checks

      alive, but does not affect you. It emits a magical aura that can be
      detected
      with&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect
      Magic} and similar effects, and can be suppressed by an antimagic
      field.</p></li></ul>
