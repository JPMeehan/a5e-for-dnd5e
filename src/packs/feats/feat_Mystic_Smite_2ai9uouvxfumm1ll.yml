      divine smite, you may expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. &nbsp;If
      you do so, you increase the damage by 1d8 per spell level to maximum of
      the smite damage of a herald of your herald+witch level.</li><li>You may
      apply an Empowered Smite effect to a divine smite even if you do not have
      that ability by expending a spell of first level or higher.</li><li>You
      also gain the following additional empowered smite
      options:<ul><li>Bewitching Smite- Your smite instead deals psychic damage,
      and on hit the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you
      for 1 minute. This ends early if you or an ally deals damage to
      them.</li><li>Bewildering Smite- Your smite instead deals psychic damage,
      and on hit the target must make a Charisma saving throw or be confused for
