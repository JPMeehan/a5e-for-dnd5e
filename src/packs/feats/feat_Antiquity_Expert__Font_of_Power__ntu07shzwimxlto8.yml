      dir="ltr">Your scholarship of magic items has progressed, as has your
      mastery with your bonded artifact, and you have begun to learn the deep
      lore of enchanted items. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li
      dir="ltr">You learn
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.dgms08g84zdlbr81]{Identify} as
      a wielder spell. It does not count against your spells
      known.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can attune to a
      magic item in 1 minute instead of an hour. Once you have used this
      benefit, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can end your attunement to
      a magic item other than your bonded artifact as an action to gain artifact
      charges equal to your Intelligence modifier.&nbsp; Once you have used this
      benefit, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li><li
      dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain an additional benefit based on the
      nature of your bonded artifact:<ul><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">If it
      is a weapon of power, you learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.7mwrwjjj3mn4yzxr]{Altered
      Strike} cantrip.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">If it is
      armor of power, you can spend an artifact charge as a bonus action to give
      it one of the following properties for one minute: feybane, fortified, or
      lightweight.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">If it is a font of
      power, you learn two ritual spells of a level you could cast from any
      spell list. They count as wielder spells for you and do not count against
      your spells known.</li></ul></li></ul>
