      <p>As a mystic arcanist studies and meditates, they come closer and closer
      to an understanding of the pure magic from which all other arcanum stems.
      You gain the following special manifestations:</p><p><strong><em>Divine
      (Radiant).</em></strong> When you cast a spell that deals radiant damage,
      you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see within
      60 feet. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 × the
      spell’s level.</p><p><strong><em>Pure Arcanum (Force). </em></strong>When
      you cast a spell that deals force damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points
      and choose one creature you can see. After the spell’s damage is resolved,
      if the creature was damaged by the spell it makes an Intelligence saving
      throw or becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
