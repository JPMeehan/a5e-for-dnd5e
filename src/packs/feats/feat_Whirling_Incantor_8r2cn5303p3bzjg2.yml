      <p>You train to move by thought and incant with your bodyâ€™s flowing
      motion, becoming nearly unassailable as you whirl and dance, escaping
      fatal blows and seamlessly blending the lines between mind and body. While
      bladechanting you gain the following additional benefits:
      </p><ul><li><p>Your Speed increases by 10 feet.</p></li><li><p>You gain a
      bonus to Dexterity checks and saving throws equal to your Intelligence
      modifier.</p></li><li><p>You gain a bonus to Intelligence checks and
      saving throws equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p></li><li><p>When you
      are targeted by an attack but before the attack is rolled, you may expend
      a spell slot to attempt a whirling arcane evasion. If you do, make a
      Dexterity saving throw and add a +2 bonus for every spell slot level above
      1st spent this way. If this Dexterity saving throw exceeds the triggering
      attack roll the attack becomes a miss, and you may immediately move up to
      10 feet in any direction. This movement does not provoke opportunity
      attacks.</p></li></ul>
