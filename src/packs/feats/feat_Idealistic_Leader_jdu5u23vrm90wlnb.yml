      <p>The strength of your principles inspires others to follow you with
      impressive dedication that makes up for whatever your stronghold lacks.
      You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Any stronghold you have or
      buy that is of frugal quality is automatically upgraded to average quality
      at no additional cost.</p></li><li><p>You gain a new follower for every 50
      staff you have in your stronghold, rather than every 100
      staff.</p></li><li><p>When you fulfill your destiny, choose a number of
      followers equal to your proficiency bonus. Each is upgraded to their most
      expensive version.</p></li></ul>
