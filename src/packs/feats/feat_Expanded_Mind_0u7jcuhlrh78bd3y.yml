      <p>You studies have granted you even greater knowledge of psionic secrets,
      granting the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your
      Intelligence score to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You immediately learn
      an additional psionic power of your choice. &nbsp;You must qualify for
      this power as normal.</li><li>Half your scholar levels count as esper
      levels for the purpose of your psionic reservoir.<br>Whenever a scholar
      ability requires you to expend a hit die, you may expend a psi die
      instead. &nbsp;Unlike normal such a psi die is always lost on being
      used.</li><li>When activating an augment on a psionic power, you may
      expend a hit die instead of a psi die. &nbsp;If an augment requires more
      than one psi die, only one of them may be replaced by a hit die.</li></ul>
