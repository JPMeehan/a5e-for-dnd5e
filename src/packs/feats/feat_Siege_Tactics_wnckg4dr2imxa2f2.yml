      <p>Your time studying how best to implement your destructive innovations
      has given you a near savant like mastery of the tactics of sieges and the
      ability to adapt them to other combat scenarios, granting the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.d71mc2057x7y6c08]{Commanding
      Presence} area is calculated using your marshal level + 1/2 your scholar
      level.</li><li>When attacking with a siege weapon, other creatures can
      spot for you, and vice versa. &nbsp;If you are making the attack, you may
      select another creature within your Commanding Presence range, and treat
      the attack as originating from there for line of sight and range purposes.
      &nbsp;Likewise an allied creature attacking with a siege weapon within
      that range may use you for this purpose.</li><li>When using one of your
      personal siege weapons, you have half cover. &nbsp;In addition, whenever
      an ally within your Commanding Presence has cover or you have cover from a
      source other than your personal siege weapon, the degree of cover is
      increased by one step, half cover becoming three quarters and
      three-quarters becoming full.</li></ul>
