      <p>Your self-mastery and elemental mastery are now one and the same. You
      channel your element with the ease and frequency of breathing. You gain
      the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Your Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by
      1, to a maximum of 20.</li>

      <li>Your elementalist levels count as adept levels for the purpose of
      determining what Focus Feature options you can select. You must have the
      Extra Attack feature to select Additional Attack, however.</li>

      <li>You can use exertion points interchangeably with spell points when
      casting elementalist spells. You cannot use spell points as a substitute
      for exertion, however.</li>

      <li>Your attacks with unarmed strikes and adept weapons deal an additional
      d4 damage of a type your Elemental Blast can deal. If you can deal
      multiple types of damage with Elemental Blast, you can choose the type of
      damage each attack deals when it hits.</li>

      </ul>
