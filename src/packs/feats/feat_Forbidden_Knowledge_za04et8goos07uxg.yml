      <p>You studies and dealings have begun t o uncover the knowledge others
      would keep from you, granting you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You
      gain a +1 bonus to your Intelligence score, to a maximum value of
      20.</li><li>Whenever you gain a new scholarly discovery, you may choose to
      learn an eldritch invocation or secret of arcana instead, and anytime you
      would gain an eldritch invocation you may gain a scholarly discovery
      instead. &nbsp;You may add your warlock and scholar levels together to
      qualify for either eldritch invocations or scholarly discoveries other
      than sixth, seventh, eighth, or penultimate arcana and for the level of
      ritual you may add to
      your@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.tguawbanmxly12iz]{Book
      of Ancient Secrets} if you have one.</li><li>If you have access to your
      pact tome you may cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.59she20yqbp2giqq]{Contact Other
      Plane} as a ritual. This is true even if you do not normally have the
      ability to ritually cast or your level would not normally be high enough
      to do so, and the casting time does not increase when doing so as normal
      for ritual casting.</li></ul>
