      <p>Your enemies never see you coming, and the few who you allow to survive
      never see you leave, either. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Dexterity or Wisdom score increases by 1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li>You gain Blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you
      already have blindsight from another source, its range increases by 10
      feet instead.</li><li>When you are in dim light or darkness, your
      <em>Sneak Attack</em> die increases by one step to a maximum die size of
      1d10. You may also choose to have the bonus damage dealt by your sneak
      attack be necrotic damage.</li><li>If you have a smoke bomb, you can spend
      a point of exertion as a bonus action to throw it at your own feet and
      teleport to an unoccupied space you could reach by taking your move
      followed by the Dash action.</li></ul>
