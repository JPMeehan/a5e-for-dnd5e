      <p>Your mastery of your chosen elemental energies comes not from a place
      of serenity and balance, but one of unbridled fury and wrath. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma
      score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>Your elementalist levels
      count as berserker levels for the purpose of gaining access to the Extra
      Attack feature.</li><li>You gain the Elemental Wrath Furious Critical
      option, which does not count against your maximum number of Furious
      Critical options known. If you already know it, it no longer counts
      against your Furious Critical options known and you may select
      another.</li></ul>
