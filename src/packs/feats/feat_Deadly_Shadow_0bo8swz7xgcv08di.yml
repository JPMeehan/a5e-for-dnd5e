      <p>You are an unquestioned master of stealth. Your enemies would doubt
      your existence if not for the number of them you had laid low. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your Sneak Attack die increases by
      one step against your Studied Adversaries to a maximum of
      d10.</p></li><li><p>While you are hidden, you may teleport up to your
      movement speed to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you have used this
      ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, you
      can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p></li></ul>
