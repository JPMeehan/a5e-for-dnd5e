      <p>It is very difficult for foes to get by you without paying for it. You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>A creature that takes the
      Disengage action still provokes opportunity attacks from
      you.</p></li><li><p>You gain proficiency with the Warning Strike maneuver
      and do not have to spend exertion to activate it.</p></li><li><p>You can
      use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against a creature within
      5 feet when it makes an attack against a target other than you if the
      target does not also have this feat.</p></li></ul>
