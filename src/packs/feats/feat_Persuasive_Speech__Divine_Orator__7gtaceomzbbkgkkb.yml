      <p>Hostile creatures within 60 feet take a â€“1d4 penalty on attack rolls.
      You can sustain this battle hymn for up to 3 rounds without expending
      additional uses of Bardic Inspiration. When a hostile creature begins its
      third consecutive turn within range of this battle hymn it becomes charmed
      by you and will not attack you or your allies. If this causes combat to
      end early, the creatures remain charmed by you for up to 1 minute
      afterward or until one of them is damaged by you or an ally. </p><p>For
      the next 24 hours after the battle hymn ends, you gain an expertise die on
      Charisma checks made against creatures that were charmed in this way. A
      creature that either shares your alignment or worships a deity that has
      your alignment becomes charmed on its second consecutive turn instead.
      Creatures that have an opposite alignment or worship a greater entity that
      has an opposite alignment cannot be charmed in this way.</p>
