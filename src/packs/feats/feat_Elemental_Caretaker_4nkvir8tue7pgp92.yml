      <p>You have a stronger-than-normal focus on the elements than a normal
      druid (or perhaps a stronger focus on the natural world than a typical
      elementalist) but the two traditions are fundamentally
      complimentary.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You gain a +1 bonus to your Wisdom score, to a maximum value of 20.
      You may change your Elementalist spellcasting ability to Wisdom if it is
      something else. Once made, this choice is permanent.</li>

      <li>You learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.tn41akceteoog5c2]{Elemental
      Manipulation} cantrip, which does not count against your druid cantrips
      known. If you already know it, you may select another druid cantrip from
      the <em>air</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>earth</em>, <em>fire</em>,
      <em>lightning</em>, or <em>water</em> school instead.</li>

      <li>Half of your druid levels count as elementalist levels for the purpose
      of determining how much damage your Elemental Blast does.</li>

      </ul>
