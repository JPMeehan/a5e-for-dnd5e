      <p>The depths of your martial studies allow the development of heretofore
      unheard of styles of combat, particularly when using your chosen weapon.
      &nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain proficiency in
      another combat tradition of your choice, and you learn one maneuver from
      it that does not count against your maneuvers known. &nbsp;If this bonus
      maneuver requires you to make one or more attacks with a weapon, it must
      be one you could use with your Mastered Weapon.
      &nbsp;</li><li>Furthermore, you may count half your scholar levels as
      fighter levels for the purpose of determining if you have extra attack and
      how many attacks you can make with it, and half your fighter levels count
      as scholar levels for the purpose of how much bonus damage is dealt when
      using
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.v4pkjilh484jph6i]{Precision
      Strikes}. &nbsp;These benefits only apply when attacking with your
      Mastered Weapon.</li></ul>
