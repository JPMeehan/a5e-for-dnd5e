      dir="ltr">Your bonded artifact and innate magical abilities have fully
      merged into a fearsome unified whole. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Your Charisma or wielder spellcasting
      ability increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">Half your wielder levels count as sorcerer levels for
      the purpose of gaining the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.q3gqqfr37rumjbf6]{Rapturous
      Presence} feature.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Half your
      sorcerer levels count as wielder levels for the purpose of gaining the
      Artifact Incarnate feature.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can
      spend a sorcery point as a bonus action to summon your bonded artifact to
      you if it is on the same plane. It appears in your hand (if it is a weapon
      or font of power) or equipped on your body (if it is an armor of power).
      If it would displace something else (a suit of armor you are already
      wearing, for example) you can either have it trade places with the other
      object or the other object can appear at your feet. At the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, certain effects may be able to block this
      feature.&nbsp;</li></ul>
