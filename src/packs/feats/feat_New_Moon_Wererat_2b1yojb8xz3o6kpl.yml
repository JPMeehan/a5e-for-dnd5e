      <p>You have learned to tame the rat within and gained some control over
      the curse of lycanthropy. On full moon nights you involuntarily change
      into a rat or rat-humanoid hybrid. While you are transformed, you gain the
      following features.</p><p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> You gain a bite
      natural weapon you are proficient with. You can use Dexterity instead of
      Strength for the attack rolls of your bite. On a hit your bite deals
      piercing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier or Dexterity
      modifier (whichever is
      highest).</p><p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim
      light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
      if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30
      feet.</p><p><strong><em>Keen Smell.</em></strong> You have advantage on
      Perception checks that rely on smell.</p>
