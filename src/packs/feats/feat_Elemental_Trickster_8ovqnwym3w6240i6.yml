      <p>In your studies, you have learned to disable the expected traits of
      your chosen element to aid your friends and confound your foes. You gain
      the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Your Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by
      1, to a maximum of 20.</li>

      <li>When you would gain a Skill Trick or an Elemental Adaptation, you can
      choose freely from either list.</li>

      <li>You can use your chosen element like a set of thieves&rsquo; tools,
      allowing you to make thieves&rsquo; tools checks without actually having
      them to hand by such as by making skeleton keys out of stone or ice,
      melting lock components with fire or cutting tripwires with focused blasts
      of shearing air. Doing this leaves obvious signs of magical tinkering
      behind, whether your check succeeds or fails.</li>

      <li>As an action you can spend 1 point of exertion to
      &ldquo;denature&rdquo; a 10-foot cube of an element you have affinity with
      and can see within 60 feet of you.

      <ul>

      <li>Earthen or stone ground crumbles into quicksand and loses its
      fertility; plants cannot be grown in the soil and it becomes difficult
      terrain.</li>

      <li>Fire continues to burn, but no longer gives off any heat, consuming
      its fuel at the same ambient temperature as the surrounding
      environment.</li>

      <li>Water becomes non-potable and normally-buoyant objects sink to the
      bottom of it.</li>

      <li>Air becomes still and loses its oxygen content. A creature in the cube
      must hold its breath or begin suffocating. This also extinguishes any open
      flames.<br><br>These changes have no fixed duration, but mixing the
      denatured element with unaffected elements of its type dissipates the
      denatured element harmlessly. For example, a 5-foot section of a larger
      fire will slowly return to heat as the surrounding fire warms it (though
      if the entire fire is contained in the cube, it will not), barren sand can
      be harmlessly mixed into fertile soil, and air and water currents will
      harmlessly dissipate denatured elements of their type. Left unattended, a
      denatured area is absorbed by the surrounding environment and vanishes
      after 1d4 hours unless sealed in a container or otherwise prevented from
      co-mingling with the normal element of its type.</li>

      </ul>

      </li>

      </ul>
