      <p>Nightstalkers can move with such swiftness that it takes a trained eye
      to see the motion at all. On your turn you can use a reaction and spend 2
      exertion to move up to 30 feet with such incredible speed that you seem to
      disappear, and after moving this way may immediately take the Hide
      action.</p>
