      <p>It is no longer just your rage that is infectious. Even as you send out
      waves of passionate emotion to your allies, you also allow them to borrow
      your other psionic abilities. &nbsp;You gain the following
      abilities:</p><ul><li>If an ally is bonded to you via the Infectious Fury
      ability or has temporary hit points from your Raging Projection, they may
      use any of your psionic powers as if they possessed them. If they wish to
      augment one of these powers, they may draw from either their psi dice if
      they have any or yours. If another creature uses one of your psi dice to
      augment a power used in this way, the die is lost on a roll equal to or
      less than half the maximum on the die, and you do not regain a die on a
      roll of maximum.</li><li>You may concentrate on any Mind Spike attack
      modes or psionic powers while raging.</li></ul>
