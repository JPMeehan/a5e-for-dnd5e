      <p>Choose a class: bard, cleric, druid, herald, sorcerer, warlock, or
      wizard. From your choice, you gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the
      spell list of your chosen class.</p></li><li><p>Choose one 1st-level spell
      to learn from that same spell list. You can cast this spell without
      expending a spell slot. Once you cast the spell in this way, you must
      finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also
      cast this spell using a spell slot of the appropriate level (or the
      appropriate number of spell points if you have warlock
      levels).</p></li><li><p>Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends
      on the class you chose: Intelligence for wizard, Wisdom for cleric or
      druid, Charisma for bard, herald, or sorcerer, or your choice of
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for warlock.</p></li></ul>
