      <p>Magic is used by all sorts of creatures across the planes, fiends no
      less than any other. Fiends tend to be more willing than most to share
      their magical power and knowledge with others, the better to lure un
      unwary souls. &nbsp;Malefica, the source of many of the darkest and most
      sordid tales of evil witches, are not inherently evil, but they are
      willing to deal with and accept guidance and gifts from evil forces. Such
      practice often leads to whispered accusations of warlock among their
      fellow witches, but they will insist that they are not selling themselves
      out to fiends, merely studying them to incorporate that knowledge into
      their own magical practice. Whether that is actually the case, whether
      they actually toe that razor thin line they placed themselves on or going
      tumbling over into temptation, is another matter entirely. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>If your witch and warlock spellcasting
      modifiers are not the same, you may change one of them to the
      other.</li><li>Choose two schools from the Black Magic list of witch
      spells. &nbsp;All spells of those schools are added to your witch and
      warlock spell lists.</li><li>You gain whichever Sanguine Contract option
      you did not choose previously.</li><li>Finally, you gain the Pact of the
      Chain if you do not already have it, or the Voice of the Chain Master
      invocation if you do. &nbsp;Your familiar must take the form of an imp or
      quasit, and it gains all the benefits of your Witch's Familiar. You may
      add your warlock levels to your witch levels for the purpose of your
      Witch's Familiar ability.</li><li>You may not gain the Good alignment
      trait by any means.</li></ul>
