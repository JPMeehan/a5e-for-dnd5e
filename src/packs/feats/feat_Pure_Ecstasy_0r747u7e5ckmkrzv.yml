      <p>You have truly mastered your trancing draughts, and giant the following
      additional benefits:</p><ul><li>While in an ecstatic rage you gain the
      following additional benefits:<ul><li>You add your witch spellcasting
      ability modifier to concentration saves.</li><li>You add your witch
      spellcasting ability modifier to your furious critical DC.</li><li>When
      entering an ecstatic rage, you may choose one spell of 1st-level or higher
      that targets one or more creatures with a casting time of one action and a
      duration of 1 minute and cast it as part of the bonus action you use to
      rage. &nbsp;If you do so, you must choose yourself as one of the targets,
      and if your rage ends this spell ends as well.</li><li>If you have
      temporary hit points from a spell you cast when you enter an ecstatic rage
      or would gain them from a spell you cast during an ecstatic rage, those
      temporary hit points are instead converted to and treated as rage hit
      points.</li><li>If you reduce a creature of higher than CR 0 to 0 hit
      points you may use your reaction to regain a spell slot of a level equal
      to or less than half the CR of the creature, minimum 1, maximum 5.
      &nbsp;You may only do so once per rage.</li></ul></li><li>You add 1/2 your
      witch levels to your berserker level to determine the number of times per
      day you can rage.</li></ul>
