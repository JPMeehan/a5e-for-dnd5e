      <p>You have become particularly adept at conveying the lessons of the
      chronicles you carry to others in practical ways and gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your
      Intelligence or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain
      the following additional battle hymn:<ul><li><strong>Oral
      Instruction.</strong> If you or one of your allies within 30ft. fail a
      charisma ability check or saving throw, they may use their reaction to add
      your intelligence modifier to the result. &nbsp;If they fail an
      intelligence ability check or saving throw, they may use their reaction to
      add your charisma modifier. &nbsp;You may sustain this battle hymn for a
      number of rounds equal to your intelligence + charisma modifier without
      spending further bardic inspiration. &nbsp;A creature using the benefit of
      this battle hymn does not cause it to end. &nbsp;This battle hymn ends
      early if you are incapacitated, silenced, or otherwise unable to
      speak.</li></ul></li></ul>
