      <p>The smite damage becomes force damage and the target must make a
      Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be teleported to an
      open space of your choice within 10 feet and stunned until the end of its
      next turn. A creature that succeeds is slowed until the end of its next
      turn, but is not teleported or stunned.</p>
