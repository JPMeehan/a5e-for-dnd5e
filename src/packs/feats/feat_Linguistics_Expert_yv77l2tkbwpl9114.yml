      <p>Youâ€™re well-versed in a variety of languages and codes, gaining the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your Intelligence score increases by 1,
      to a maximum of 20.</p></li><li><p>You learn three languages of your
      choice.</p></li><li><p>You can invent ciphers and are able to teach a
      cipher you create to others. Anyone who knows the cipher can encode and
      read hidden messages made with it; the apparent text must be at least four
      times longer than the hidden message. Other creatures can detect the
      presence of the cipher if they spend a minute examining it and succeed on
      an Investigation check against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, they can
      read the hidden message.</p></li></ul>
