      <p>You regain a spent use of Divine Smite. In order to use this feature,
      you must have scored a critical hit against a creature with a CR equal to
      at least half your character level. Once you have used this a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus, it does not function again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
