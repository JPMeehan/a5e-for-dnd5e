      <p>Many, when confronted with supernatural horror, turn to the divine for
      comfort and protection. Though you may like to think of yourself as above
      superstition, you cannot doubt the efficacy of such practices, and in the
      blackest darkness even you will seek the aid of faith, gaining the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain access to the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.zhuf06durl8bnmh3]{Turn
      Undead} ability of a cleric. Use your combined Ranger and Scholar levels
      as your effective cleric level to determine how many times you can use it
      per short rest. &nbsp;Your DC for this ability is 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier. &nbsp;By expending a hit die
      when doing so, you may apply an
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.zezsezm2e0azb3ty]{Empowered
      Turning} effect along with it, and when doing so with
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.1il31a6es33x2grt]{Turn
      Supernatural} you may also select aberrations as the creature type.
      &nbsp;If you expend a hit die and inspiration, you may instead apply two
      empowered turning effects.</li><li>You may also expend a hit die to
      replicate the effects of a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.wa2nd43b9dvkh1yu]{Protection
      from Evil and Good} spell as well as the <em>backcountry elder sign</em>
      rare spell. &nbsp;Similar to scholar abilities, this does not count as
      actually casting a spell. &nbsp;If you have the Hedge Mage or Wildborn
      archetype, you know and may also cast this spell using spell slots if you
      have slots of a high enough level, treating it as a Ranger and/or Scholar
      spell.</li></ul>
