      <p>You can use an action to target the focus of your Fearsome Pursuit if
      it is within 30 feet. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 +
      your proficiency bonus + your highest mental ability score modifier). On a
      failure, it takes psychic damage equal to 1d6 × your proficiency bonus and
      is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half
      damage and is rattled until the end of its next turn. Once you have used
      this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t
      use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p></p><p><em>(A5E Foundry
