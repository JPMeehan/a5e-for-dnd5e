      <p>With the string drawn taught, your rings of eldritch symbols form
      arrows of pure magic able to assail a whole platoon at
      once.</p><p>Whenever you cast a spell with a Cone area, you may
      additionally make ranged weapon attacks with a ranged weapon you are
      wielding against targets within that conical area. You may make up to a
      number of attacks equal to the level of the spell cast, each against a
      different target. Ranged attacks made in this way ignore the loading
      quality of weapons and use your conjured magical ammunition.</p>
