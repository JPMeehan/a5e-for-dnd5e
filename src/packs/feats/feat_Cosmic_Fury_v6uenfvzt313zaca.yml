      <p>You have reached the apex of blending your aggression and patron-fueled
      power. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>When you select this
      feat, choose a damage type from necrotic, psychic, or radiant. It is added
      to the list of options for Ferocious Blast.</p></li><li><p>While you are
      raging, the first time on you hit with an attack on your turn, you can
      spend spell points to bolster your damage. Each point spent does two
      points of damage of one of the types tied to Ferocious Blast. You may only
      spend a number of spell points less than or equal to your proficiency
      bonus on any individual attack.</p></li><li><p>Your pact boon
      improves:</p><p>If you have Pact of the Blade, whenever you hit with your
      pact weapon, if you are not raging, it deals an additional 1d4 points of
      force damage. If you are raging, you can choose to have it deal 1d4 points
      of force damage or 1d6 points of damage of one of the types tied to your
      Ferocious Blast.</p><p>If you have Pact of the Chain, your familiar can
      share in your fury. While you are raging, it gains rage hit points at half
      the rate you do and also gains a single natural weapon attack appropriate
      to its form (claw, bite, stinger, etc.) with an attack bonus of your
      proficiency score + your spellcasting modifier that deals 1d6 points of
      non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage + 1d4 points of a
      damage type available with your Ferocious Blast.</p><p>If you have Pact of
      the Tome, add 3 spells from any list to your warlock spells known. None
      may be greater than level 2, and each must deal a type of damage available
      with your Ferocious Blast. They do not count against your maximum spells
      known and cannot be replaced with other spells. You may also choose a
      cantrip that deals one of the selected damage types instead of a leveled
      spell. In this case, it does not count against your maximum cantrips known
      and cannot be replaced.</p></li></ul>
