      <p>You have learned to merge your mastery of the elements and your mastery
      of yourself into a harmonious and powerful whole. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>You can change your
      elementalist spellcasting ability to Wisdom if you desire. Once made, this
      choice is permanent.</li><li>When you use your <em>Long Step</em> to dash,
      you can spend a spell point to leave behind a damaging trail of an element
      you have elemental affinity with in each space you move through. The
      effect deals a number of d6s of damage of a type your elemental blast can
      deal equal to your proficiency bonus to creatures that enter an affected
      space for the first time on their turn or who start their turn there. The
      trail extends 5 feet up from the surface you moved across and persists
      until the beginning of your next turn.</li></ul>
