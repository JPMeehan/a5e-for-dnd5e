      <p>You have come to fully embody your mystical oath, and for your
      dedication magic answers your call. &nbsp;You gain the following
      additional benefits:</p><ul><li>You may prepare witch or herald spells of
      any level you have spell slots for, even if they are higher spell level
      than your current level allows as long as they are of a level the class
      preparing them could potentially cast. &nbsp;Such higher level spells must
      be from your herald archetype bonus spell school(s), your witch's magic
      bonus spell schools, or any bonus spell schools or individual bonus spells
      from your witch archetype. &nbsp;A class may still only prepare spells
      from its own list.</li><li>You may add half your witch levels to your
      herald level for the purpose of what spell slots you may use to gain a
      temporary exertion pool.</li><li>You gain the herald Divine Recovery
      feature if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you do, you may use it
      proficiency bonus times per long rest.</li></ul>
