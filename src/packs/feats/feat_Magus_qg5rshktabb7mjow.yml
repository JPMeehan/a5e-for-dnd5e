      <p>Sometimes, wizards find they have reached the limits of their arcane
      studies, but sense there is more to know, more mysteries to unravel, and
      then turn their attentions beyond the normal limits of their discipline,
      the need to learn and study itself becoming a form of reverence and
      worship for that which they study. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your Wisdom score, to a
      maximum value of 20.</li><li>If your witch spellcasting ability modifier
      is not intelligence, you may change it to intelligence.</li><li>When
      scribing a spell into your wizard spellbook that is on both the witch and
      wizard spell lists, half the time and gold required to do so. This is
      applied after the benefit from Broad Magic.</li><li>You may apply Flexible
      Thinking to prepared witch spells as well, but only for spells on both the
      witch and wizard spell lists. &nbsp;You may use this ability twice per
      short or long rest, once each for wizard and witch prepared
      spells.</li><li>You may freely take any wizard elective study whenever you
      would gain a magical mystery, or a magical mystery anytime you would gain
      an elective study, and add half your wizard level to your witch level for
      the purpose of magical mysteries.</li><li>If you have the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find
      Familiar} spell in your wizard spellbook, you may add your wizard level to
      your witch level for the purpose of your witch's familiar
      ability.</li></ul>
