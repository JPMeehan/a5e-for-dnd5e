      <p>Your connection to true lichdom improves with&mdash;what
      else&mdash;practice and study.</p><ul><li>You are now immune to poison
      (and the poisoned condition) and fatigue.</li><li>You have advantage on
      saving throws to avoid becoming charmed, frightened, or
      paralyzed.</li><li><strong><em>Improved Soul Vessel. </em></strong>The
      magic of your soul vessel strengthens. You now are proficient in death
      saving throws, and if you die, if your soul vessel is intact, you return
      to life 2d6 weeks after your death.</li><li>Your soul vessel itself also
      becomes more durable. Its AC increases to 18, its hit points increase to
      60, and it now has resistance to damage from nonmagical
      weapons.</li><li><strong><em>Improved Forbidden Knowledge.
      </em></strong>You learn a new 4th-level spell, 5th-level spell, and
      6th-level spell. The spells must be ones from the <em>necromancy</em>,
      <em>affliction</em>, <em>knowledge</em>, <em>necrotic</em>,
      <em>psychic</em>, or <em>scrying </em>schools.&nbsp;These spells do not
      count against the spells you know or can have prepared, and they always
      count as being prepared. These spells are added to your class's spell list
      for you; if you have more than one spellcasting class, you choose which
      list to add them to.</li></ul>
