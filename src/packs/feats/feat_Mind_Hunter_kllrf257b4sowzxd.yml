      <p>Your psionic capabilities and wilderness skills have combined to make
      you into a fearsome apex predator. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom score or your Intelligence score
      increases by +1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>While your <em>Psychic
      Focus</em> is active, you may spend an exertion point to teleport up to 50
      feet instead of moving as normal.</li><li>Creatures that take psychic
      damage from your weapon attacks must make a Constitution saving throw
      against your maneuver DC or be psychically poisoned for one minute. While
      a creature is poisoned this way, it suffers the poisoned condition and
      takes 1d4 ongoing poison damage at the beginning of each of its turns. A
      creature may attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns,
      ending the effect on a success.</li></ul>
