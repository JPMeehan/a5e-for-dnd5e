      <p>You have accepted power from two different sources. In some cases, they
      may be different sides of the same entity, but often this represents a
      conflict of interest and a tightrope of devotion to walk and frequently a
      double life you must conceal.</p><p>You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</p></li><li><p>You may change your warlock spellcasting ability to
      Wisdom if you desire. Once made, this choice is
      permanent.</p></li><li><p>You gain proficiency with the Deception skill if
      you do not already have it and gain an expertise die if you do. You also
      make saves against effects that would force you to be truthful, prevent
      you from lying, or reveal your lies as the falsehoods they are at
      advantage.</p></li><li><p>You may spend a use of Channel Divinity to gain
      3 spell points.</p></li></ul>
