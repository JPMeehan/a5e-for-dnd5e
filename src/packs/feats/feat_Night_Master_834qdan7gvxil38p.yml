      <p>As an experienced nightstalker you have learned complicated and
      fiercely guarded traditions that channel your mental energy through
      demanding techniques which unlock magic by manipulating the physical
      world.</p><p>You can spend exertion to cast any spells from the air,
      earth, fear, fire, movement, obscurement, plants, poison, senses, shadow,
      transformation, unarmed, or water schools at the cost of 2 exertion per
      spell level. You use your focus save DC for spells cast this way, and your
      spell attack modifier is equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
