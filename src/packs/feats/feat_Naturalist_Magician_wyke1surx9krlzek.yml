      <p>Magic isn&rsquo;t just something found in dusty libraries of arcane
      tomes, hallowed temples, or alien far off planes. &nbsp;It permeates the
      very earth you stand on, the air you breathe. Nature has a magic all
      it&rsquo;s own, and some immerse themselves in this magic body and spirt,
      blurring the line between witch and druid. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your Wisdom score, to a
      maximum value of 20.</li><li>If your witch spellcasting ability modifier
      is not Wisdom, you may change it to Wisdom.</li><li>You may add half your
      witch level to your druid level for the purpose of your wildshape
      feature.</li><li>You gain the Scholar of Old Ways Natural Demeanor option
      if you do not already have it, or a different option if you
      do.</li><li>You may freely take any druid secret of nature whenever you
      would gain a magical mystery, or a magical mystery anytime you would gain
      a secret of nature, and add half your druid level to your witch level for
      the purpose of magical mysteries.</li></ul>
