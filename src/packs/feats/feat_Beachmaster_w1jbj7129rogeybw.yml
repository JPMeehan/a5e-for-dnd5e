      <p>You descend from a long line of fearsome selkies and your seal form is
      mighty to behold, (although you may have taken some time to grow into it).
      If you originally chose the sea lion stat block for seal form, it is
      replaced with your choice of either a walrus or a stellar sea lion. If you
      originally chose the seal stat block, it is replaced with your choice of
      either an elephant seal or a leopard seal stat block. You cannot later
      change your choice.</p>

      <p>You may also choose to take this feat in place of a heritage gift. If
      you do so, you may later choose to gain a selkie heritage gift as though
      it were a feat.</p>
