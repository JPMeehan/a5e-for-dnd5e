      <p>Many scholars have, in the course of their studies, uncovered far more
      knowledge of the terrifying monsters that haunt this world than any
      ordinary person would care to know. Many monster hunters are keenly aware
      that when battling true horrors, knowledge is a more valuable weapon than
      mere blades. &nbsp;Monster slayers understand these truths and dedicate
      themselves to arming themselves well with this weapon to eradicate
      monsters wherever they threaten the innocent. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your
      Intelligence or Wisdom score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain
      an additional
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.t7ujv9cc4us40fj9]{Studied
      Adversary}, which is always active. &nbsp;This additional adversary must
      be of the following types: aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or
      undead. You also gain an additional number of uses of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.8qhg7efkuie3fwh2]{Accuracy
      Bonus} equal to your intelligence modifier. &nbsp;These bonus uses may
      only be used against a studied adversary. &nbsp;</li><li>You gain your
      choice of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.v4pkjilh484jph6i]{Precision
      Strikes} or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.okthtwyohmh0eoa5]{Mystic
      Apprentice} scholar abilities. &nbsp;If you choose Precision Strikes, you
      may make an Nature, History, Arcana, or Religion check using intelligence
      (the specific skill used must be one that could be used to recall
      knowledge about the creature in question) with a DC of 10+the CR of the
      creature when targeting a favored adversary and, if successful, the
      benefits last for 1 minute rather than until the end of your next turn.
      &nbsp;If you choose Mystic Apprentice, you gain
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.7mwrwjjj3mn4yzxr]{Altered
      Strike} as a bonus cantrip, in addition to the other two you would
      normally gain.</li></ul>
