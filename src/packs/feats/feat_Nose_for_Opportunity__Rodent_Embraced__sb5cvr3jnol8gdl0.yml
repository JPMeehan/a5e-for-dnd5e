    value: >-
      <p>When an ally strikes a creature you can see with a melee attack, you
      can use your reaction to move up to your Speed, ending your move adjacent
      to that creature and making a melee weapon attack against it. If the
      creature is bloodied and the attack hits, you score a critical hit. Once
      you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>
