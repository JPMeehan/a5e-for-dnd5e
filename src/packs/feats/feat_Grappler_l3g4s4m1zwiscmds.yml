      <p>Youâ€™ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in
      close-quarters grappling. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have advantage on attack rolls against a
      creature you are grappling.</p></li><li><p>You can use your action to try
      to pin a creature grappled by you. The creature makes a Strength or
      Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you and the
      creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.</p></li></ul>
