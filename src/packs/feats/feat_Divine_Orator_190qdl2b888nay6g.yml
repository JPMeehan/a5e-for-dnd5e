      <p>Proclaimers can use their oration skills to spread their version of
      ultimate truth into even the most stubborn of acolytes.</p><p>You learn
      the Divine Inspiration and Persuasive Speech battle hymns. These special
      battle hymns can only be performed while you are using your voice Art
      Specialty as a spell focus.</p><p><strong><em>Divine Inspiration.</em>
      </strong>When an ally within 15 feet hits a creature with a melee weapon
      attack, your ally can deliver a Divine Smite just as if you had delivered
      it yourself using your Divine Smite feature (expending one of your uses).
      If you are able to empower your smites, you may choose to empower it as
      normal.</p><p><strong><em>Persuasive Speech.</em></strong>&nbsp;Hostile
      creatures within 60 feet take a â€“1d4 penalty on attack rolls. You can
      sustain this battle hymn for up to 3 rounds without expending additional
      uses of Bardic Inspiration. When a hostile creature begins its third
      consecutive turn within range of this battle hymn it becomes charmed by
      you and will not attack you or your allies. If this causes combat to end
      early, the creatures remain charmed by you for up to 1 minute afterward or
      until one of them is damaged by you or an ally. For the next 24 hours
      after the battle hymn ends, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks
      made against creatures that were charmed in this way. A creature that
      either shares your alignment or worships a deity that has your alignment
      becomes charmed on its second consecutive turn instead. Creatures that
      have an opposite alignment or worship a greater entity that has an
      opposite alignment cannot be charmed in this way.</p>
