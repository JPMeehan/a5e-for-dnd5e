      hit, deal an additional 1d6 damage, and are considered magical for the
      purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
      damage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">If you have a selkie heritage gift or chose to take the
      Beachmaster feat in place of a heritage gift, you may instead choose to
      take this feat in place of a paragon gift.</p>
