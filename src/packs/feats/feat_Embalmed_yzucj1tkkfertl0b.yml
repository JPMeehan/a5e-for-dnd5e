    value: >-
      <p>You have been through the process of living embalming, which is a
      painful and traumatic process that leaves you in a half-living state
      regardless of whether you agreed to it. However, the process is not
      without its advantages.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits and
      drawbacks:</p><ul><li><p>Whenever you take fire damage, your flammable,
      solvent-soaked wrappings and papery flesh catch fire dealing 1d10 ongoing
      fire damage to you until you or another creature spends an action to
      extinguish the flames. This damage continues indefinitely unless halted as
      an action.</p></li><li><p>You can hold your breath for a number of minutes
      equal to your Constitution score, you only need 1 supply per week to
      survive, and you do not suffer from exposure to environmental extreme heat
      and extreme cold.</p></li><li><p>You have resistance to necrotic and
      poison damage.</p></li><li><p>You gain an exertion pool with 3 points of
      exertion in it if you do not have one or your existing exertion pool
      increases by 3 points.</p></li><li><p>When you hit with a melee attack,
      you may spend a point of exertion to deal an additional 1d6 necrotic
      damage to the target. You may only use this benefit once per
      attack.</p></li></ul>
