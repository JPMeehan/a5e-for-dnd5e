      <p>Your tactical expertise gives your allies an edge in
      combat.</p><ul><li><p>When using the Help action to aid an ally in
      attacking a creature, the targeted creature can be up to 30 feet away
      instead of 5 feet.</p></li><li><p>If an ally benefiting from your Help
      action scores a critical hit on the targeted creature, you can use your
      reaction to make a single weapon attack against that creature. Your attack
      scores a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. If you already have a feature
      that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range
      for that attack is increased by 1 (maximum 17–20).</p></li><li><p>When a
      creature is damaged by an attack that was aided by the use of your Help
      action, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the
      end of your next turn.</p></li></ul>
