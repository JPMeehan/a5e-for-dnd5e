      <p>Many are the secrets nature hides, and much knowledge is there for the
      taking for those with the patients or aptitude to learn it. &nbsp;Whether
      scholars who choose to abandon dusty library, lecture halls, and
      laboratories for the much more verdant classroom of nature, or druids who
      dedicate themselves to the pursuit of all the knowledge the world has to
      offer, wild hermits often know lost or hidden truths unknown to others,
      some jealously guarding these treasures, others freely sharing them. You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice
      of your Intelligence or Wisdom score, to a maximum value of
      20.</li><li>You gain an expertise die on nature and survival checks.
      &nbsp;You may always choose to use either intelligence or wisdom for
      nature or checks, your choice. &nbsp;You also gain an additional specialty
      in nature checks.</li><li>You gain your choice of additional
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.sygit0xifd4lbg3g]{Natural
      Demeanor} option.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, any time a scholar ability
      requires you to expend a hit die, you may spend a use of wild shape
      instead.</li></ul>
