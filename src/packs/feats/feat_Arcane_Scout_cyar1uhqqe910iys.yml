      <p>You are trained in both magic and woodcraft, making you more
      self-reliant than most mages and more knowledgeable of the supernatural
      than most rangers. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your
      Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p></li><li><p>When
      you finish a short rest in natural surroundings, you may un-prepare a
      number of wizard spells up to your ranger level and prepare an equal
      number of different wizard spells in their place.</p></li><li><p>With an
      hour of searching in natural surroundings, you can find
      naturally-occurring items that carry the same magical resonance as a
      single spell component costing up to 5gp x your character level and may
      use them as a substitute for the material component of a single casting of
      that spell. This consumes the natural items, even if the spell component
      is not normally consumed.</p></li><li><p>Your spellbook is immune to fire
      damage and is not damaged by immersion in water.</p></li><li><p>You gain
      proficiency with your choice of the bookbinder&rsquo;s kit,
      alchemist&rsquo;s tools, or the herbalism kit.</p></li></ul>
