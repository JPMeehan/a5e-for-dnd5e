      <p>Your insight into all matters arcane reaches well beyond the limits of
      normal wizards, as does your dedication to it. &nbsp;You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain the Bestow Magic ability if you do
      not already have it, but may only bestow spells on both the witch and
      wizard spell lists. &nbsp;Alternatively, if you would normally have the
      Bestow Magic feature you may use it on any witch or wizard spell you have
      prepared and may imbue a number of spells at a time equal to 1/2 your
      proficiency bonus, rounded down.</li><li>You add your witch and wizard
      levels together for the purpose of the Signature Spells ability. You may
      only choose spells on both the wizard and witch spell lists for signature
      spells higher level than your wizard level alone would qualify for, but
      may choose any spell in your wizard spell book or on the witch spell list
      for those your wizard level alone would qualify for.</li><li>You gain one
      option from the wizard Spell Intensity ability.</li></ul>
