      <p>Your attempts to reach across the divide have led to a deeper
      understanding of how the bestowed power of warlocks fits into the tapestry
      of magic, and of just how much the warlock brings of to that equation
      themself. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a magical
      mystery and Eldritch Invocation of your choice.</li><li>Anytime you would
      gain a magical mystery you may gain an eldritch invocation or secret of
      arcana, and if you would gain an eldritch invocation you may gain a
      magical mystery instead. &nbsp;You may add half your witch levels to your
      warlock level for the purpose of qualifying for eldritch invocations or
      secrets of arcana and half your warlock level to your witch levels for the
      purpose of magical mysteries. &nbsp;If you take the sixth, seventh,
      eighth, or penultimate arcanum invocations and your warlock level is not
      high enough to qualify on its own, you must choose a spell that is on both
      the witch and warlock spell lists.</li></ul>
