      <p>Your psionic development offers further permanent enhancements to your
      already mentally empowered physical abilities, granting the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>When using your Flurry of Blows, you may expend a psi
      die and roll it in order to make use your Mind Strike as part of the same
      bonus action.</li><li>When you use Long Step, you may roll a psi die and
      increase the bonus movement speed by an amount equal to 5 x the result of
      the roll. &nbsp;Similar to the bonus from Mind over Matter, this is added
      after all other modifications to movement speed and multiplied by dashing,
      the haste spell, or other similar effects.</li><li>When you would take
      damage while under the effect of Patient Defence, you use your reaction
      and roll a psi die and reduce the damage by an amount equal to the roll +
      your Intelligence Modifier.</li><li>In the case of all the above
      abilities, on a roll of 1 or 2 on the psi die the die is expended. On a
      roll of the maximum value on the die you instead regain one, if any, lost
      die.</li></ul>
