      <p>As your psychic rage lashes out, you have learned to instinctually
      direct the bodies of those affected to heal and repair themselves. You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>When you use Raging Projection to
      grant a creature temporary or rage hit points, instead of Mind Strike you
      may also use your Chirurgury power on the same target.</li><li>If you
      would be reduced to 0 hit points while raging, you may immediately use a
      reaction to target yourself with the Chirurgury power.</li></ul>
