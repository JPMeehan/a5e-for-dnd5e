      <p>The psychic blasts you use to lash out at your foes strike harder than
      ever, fueled by the raw power of your rage. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>The minimum DC for concentration saves against your
      Mind Spike damage is increased by 5, generally DC 15.</li><li>You may
      increase the damage dealt by your Mind Strike by an amount equal to your
      Constitution modifier, and while raging you may apply Range, Harm, and
      Split basic augments to your Mind Strike as if they were a psionic power.
      You may only apply these basic augments to your mind strike one time each,
      you may only do so when using attack modes that target only a single
      creature, and a psi die expended on the Harm augment is always expended
      and cannot regain a die, regardless of roll.</li></ul>
