      <p>You learn the Sing as you Slay additional battle hymn.</p>

      <h2>Sing as you Slay.</h2>

      <p>You can target a number of allied creatures with this battle hymn equal
      to your charisma modifier and may not target yourself. An allied creature
      has a critical hit range with melee weapon attacks equal to that granted
      by your crushing blows ability. If they already have an equal or greater
      critical hit range with melee weapon attacks, they instead increase their
      critical hit range by 1 to a maximum of 17-20. When a creature under the
      effects of this battle hymn critically hits with a melee weapon, they may
      apply one of your Furious Critical effects. If you start your turn raging,
      you may sustain this battle hymn without expending any additional uses of
      Bardic Inspiration.</p>

      <p>In addition, if you critically hit with a melee weapon attack while
      raging, you regain an expended use of bardic inspiration.</p>
