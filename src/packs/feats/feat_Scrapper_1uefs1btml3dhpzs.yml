      <li>

      <p>You gain proficiency with a combat tradition of your choice.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Your fighter levels count as adept levels for the purpose of the Extra
      Attack feature.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Your fighter levels count as adept levels for the purpose of
      determining which Focus Feature options you can take.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Half of your adept levels count as fighter levels for the purpose of
      acquiring instances of the fighter&rsquo;s Maneuver Specialization
