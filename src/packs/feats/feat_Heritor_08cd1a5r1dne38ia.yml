      born with innate magical abilities, but you also have acquired an
      artifact, and through experimentation, you have begun to forging both into
      a unified whole. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li
      dir="ltr">Your Charisma or wielder spellcasting ability increases by 1, to
      a maximum of 20.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Your bonded
      artifact functions as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer
      spells.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain proficiency with
      History or an expertise die if you are already proficient. You also gain
      the legends skill specialty, or a different History skill specialty if you
      already have it.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can spend a
      sorcery point and an artifact charge as a bonus action to empower your
      weapon. For the rest of your turn, the weapon deals additional force
      damage equal to your proficiency bonus and if you score a critical hit,
      you can recover an artifact charge or sorcery point (your choice). You can
      only recover a single point this way each turn, regardless of how many
      critical hits you score.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain
      the following minor metamagic option. It doesn&rsquo;t count against your
      metamagic options known: <strong>Wielded Spell</strong></li></ul>
