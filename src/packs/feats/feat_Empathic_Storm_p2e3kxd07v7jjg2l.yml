      <p>Some berserkers have their emotions burn wild, reaching beyond them
      when they rage to drive allies forth and assault the minds of enemies.
      Some of these take this even further, honing this latent talent beyond
      their rage into real psionic ability, though they never forget where their
      power truly comes from. &nbsp;You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Strength
      or Intelligence score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>While raging, you
      may choose to use Raging Projection and Mind Strike as part of the same
      bonus action. &nbsp;If you use Raging Projection to grant an ally
      temporary or rage hit hit points they function independently, but if you
      use it to damage a creature, you add psychic damage equal to the damage of
      your Raging Projection to the damage of your Mind Strike as a single
      source of damage, affecting any of the same creatures. If your Mind Strike
      misses or the target saves and they would normally take no damage, they
      instead still take damage equal to your Raging Projection.</li></ul>
