    value: >-
      <p>Skilled eldritch archers can subvert their arcane power to enchant the
      conjured arrows with rings of eldritch symbols and energy that form around
      their weapons as they fire.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever you make a ranged weapon
      attack, you may choose to expend a 1st-level spell slot or higher to
      enhance the attack to be empowered or unerring. You cannot enhance more
      than one attack in a turn in this way.</p><p><strong><em>Empowered.</em>
      </strong>An empowered shot deals an additional 2d6 force damage, and an
      additional 1d6 force damage for each spell slot level above
      1st.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Unerring.</em></strong> An unerring shot
      gains a +2 bonus to the attack roll, and an additional +2 bonus for each
      spell slot level above 1st.</p>
