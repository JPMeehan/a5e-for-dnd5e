    value: >-
      <p>When using the Voice art specialty as your spell focus, you can expend
      a bardic inspiration die when you start a rage. You can cast bard spells
      during that rage, but the total number of spell levels you can cast over
      the course of that particular rage cannot exceed maximum value of your
      bardic inspiration die (6 for a d6, 8 for a d8, etc.) You still cannot
      concentrate on spells, nor may you cast non-bard spells.</p>
