      <p>Whenever you would use your Divine Smite feature and the triggering
      attack was made with your pact weapon, you can choose one of the following
      effects. Once you have used this feature you can&rsquo;t do so again until
      you finish a long rest . Alternatively, you can use this feature by
      expending a spell slot of 1st-level or higher.</p><h3><strong>Traumatizing
      Smite</strong></h3><p>The smite damage is psychic damage and the target
      must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be both
      frightened of you and confused for one minute. An affected creature may
      repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the confused
      condition on the first successful save and the frightened one on the
      second. A creature that successfully saves on the initial save is not
      confused or frightened.</p><h3><strong>Displacing
      Smite</strong></h3><p>The smite damage becomes force damage and the target
      must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be
      teleported to an open space of your choice within 10 feet and stunned
      until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is slowed until
      the end of its next turn, but is not teleported or stunned.</p>
