      <p>You have learned to combine the power granted by your elemental
      abilities and bonded artifact in ways few can fathom, much less
      emulate.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20.</li>

      <li>If a spell appears on both the elemental and wielder lists, you may
      treat your elementalist levels as wielder levels for the purpose of
      learning and casting it. For example, if a 4th-level spell appears on both
      your elementalist and wielder lists, you may learn it if your combined
      wielder and elementalist levels total at least 13.</li>

      <li>Half your wielder levels count as elementalist levels for the purpose
      of what Elemental Defense options you have access to.</li>

      <li>While wielding your Bonded Artifact, your elemental blast&rsquo;s
      range increases by 30 feet.</li>

      </ul>
