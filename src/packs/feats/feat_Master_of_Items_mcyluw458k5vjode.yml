      <p>Your studies have unlocked further capabilities for your bonded
      artifact.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1
      bonus to your choice of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score, to a
      maximum value of 20.</li><li>Half your artificer levels count as wielder
      levels for the purpose of determining your access to artifact
      whispers.</li><li>Half your wielder levels count as artificer levels for
      the purpose of determining your infusion limit.</li><li>You may apply a
      second infusion to your bonded artifact. It observes the same rules as
      described in Artifact Whisperer, but if both infusions require attunement,
      it counts against your attunement limit as if it were a single
      item.</li></ul>
