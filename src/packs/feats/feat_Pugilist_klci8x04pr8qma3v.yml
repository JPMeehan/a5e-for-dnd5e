      <p>Some train for years developing the skills to turn their bodies into
      living weapons. Some just don't give a rats hindquarters and throw
      themselves into fights unarmed because they can't be bothered to find a
      weapon. When you combine both effects into one, you get a Pugilist. These
      fighters meld discipline and fury into a maelstrom of blows with whatever
      lies at hand, or even nothing at all, while a combination of grace and
      power make them wildly unpredictable.</p><p>Whenever you enter a rage, you
      gain a temporary pool of exertion points equal to a roll of your martial
      arts die + the number of rage hit points you would gain each round. These
      bonus exertion points disappear at the end of your rage, and can only be
      used for Flurry of Blows, Unorthodox Arsenal, or to activate maneuvers or
      focus features that involve making an attack with an unarmed strike or
      improvised weapon or using a basic manuever. You may also use any of your
      Furious Critical abilities with unarmed strikes and improvised
      weapons.</p>
