      <p>Fate seems to smile on you when you need it most.&nbsp;</p><p>You gain
      3 fate points. Whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving
      throw and do not have disadvantage, you may spend a fate point to roll an
      additional d20 and choose whichever result you wish. You may do this after
      the initial roll has occurred, but before the outcome is known. If you
      have disadvantage, you may instead spend a fate point to choose one of the
      d20 rolls and reroll it.</p><p>Alternatively, when you are attacked, you
      may choose to spend a fate point to force the attacking creature to reroll
      the attack. The creature resolves the attack with the result you
      choose.</p><p>You regain all expended fate points when you finish a long
      rest.</p>
