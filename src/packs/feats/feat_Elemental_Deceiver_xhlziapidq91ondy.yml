      <p>In your presence, your chosen element behaves how you say it does,
      regardless of what others may expect&mdash;to their peril. You gain the
      following benefits.</p><ul><li>Your Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>The area of
      your elements you can denature increases from a 10-foot cube to a 30-foot
      one.</li><li>If you have multiple elemental affinities, you can spend an
      action and 4 spell points to make a 30-foot cube of one of your elements
      appear as another, disguising stone pillars as open air, bodies of water
      or empty holes as solid ground, a roaring fire as unburnt stone,
      etc.</li><li>When you deal sneak attack damage, you regain a spell point.
      Once you have used this benefit a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long
      rest.&nbsp;</li></ul>
