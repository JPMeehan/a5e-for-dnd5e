      <p>You create a map with yourself at the center, or update a map
      previously created with this spell. When creating a map, you choose its
      scale, from 100 by 100 feet to 100 by 100 miles. As part of the spell, you
      can make notes or other annotations on the map. The map only includes
      locations that you&rsquo;ve seen and traveled through. The map
      doesn&rsquo;t show areas at a significantly different elevation from your
      current location. If you cast the spell while you are lost, the spell
      fails.</p>

      <p>At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, some magical areas can&rsquo;t be
      mapped with this spell.</p>
