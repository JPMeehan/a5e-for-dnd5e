      <p>You impart sentience in the target, granting it an Intelligence of 10
      and proficiency in a language you know. A plant targeted by this spell
      gains the ability to move, as well as senses identical to those of a
      human. The Narrator assigns awakened plant statistics (such as an awakened
      shrub or awakened tree).</p><p>The target is charmed by you for 30 days or
      until you or your companions harm it. Depending on how you treated the
      target while it was charmed, when the condition ends the awakened creature
      may choose to remain friendly to you.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> Target an additional creature for each slot level
      above 5th. Each target requires its own material component.</p>
