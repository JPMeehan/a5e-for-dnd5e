    value: >-
      <p>You briefly transform your weapon or fist into another material and
      strike with it, making a melee weapon attack against a target within your
      reach.</p><p>You use your spellcasting ability for your attack and damage
      rolls, and your melee weapon attack counts as if it were made with a
      different material for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity
      to nonmagical attacks and damage: either bone, bronze, cold iron, steel,
      stone, or wood.</p><p>When you reach 5th level, you can choose silver or
      mithral as the material.</p><p>When you reach 11th level, if you have the
      Extra Attack feature you make two melee weapon attacks as part of the
      casting of this spell instead of one. In addition, you can choose
      adamantine as the material.</p><p>When you reach 17th level, your attacks
      with this spell deal an extra 1d6 damage.</p>
