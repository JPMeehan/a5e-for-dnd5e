      <p>The target's spirit is bolstered. Until the spell ends, the target
      gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at
      the start of each of its turns and it cannot be frightened. Any temporary
      hit points remaining are lost when the spell ends.</p><p><strong><em>Cast
      at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Target one additional creature for each
      slot level above 1st.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare:
      Glowing Heroism.</strong> The target glows with bright light in a 10-foot
      radius and dim light an additional 5 feet. When a creature within the
      targetâ€™s glow regains hit points, it regains 1d4 additional hit
      points.</p>
