You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Damage dealt by the wall increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p>",
