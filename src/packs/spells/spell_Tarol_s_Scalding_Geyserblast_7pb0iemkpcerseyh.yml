    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">A high-pressure stream of water blasts forth from your
      outstretched hand. Creatures must make a Strength saving throw or take 6d6
      points of bludgeoning damage, be pushed 20 feet away from you and knocked
      prone. A creature that succeeds takes half damage and is not pushed or
      knocked prone.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, the water douses any unattended flames and
      scours any clinging substances such as slime, oil, or contact poisons from
      the surface of every creature in the stream.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> The damage increases
      by 1d6 for every spell slot level above 3rd. The push distance increases
      by an additional 5 feet for every two spell slot levels above 3rd.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong

      Tarol&rsquo;s Scalding Geyserblast.</strong> The stream is made of
      pressurized, superheated steam and deals 4d6 bludgeoning and 4d6 fire
      damage. It lacks the pushing effect, and creatures in the path make a
      Dexterity save to take half damage instead of a Strength save.</p>
