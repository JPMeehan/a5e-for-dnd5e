If you are in territory depicted on the map, your position is marked by a small glowing spot on the map. The spot continues to move with your position on it, updating once per minute. If you enter territory not marked on the map, the spell ends. While your position is marked this way, you cannot become lost by mundane means and gain a 1d6 expertise die on all checks against becoming lost by magical means.</p>\n<p>The spell depicts your position as accurately as the map will allow, but poorly-drawn maps may lengthen the duration of your travel or cause you to make checks to avoid hazards at disadvantage at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n</div>",
