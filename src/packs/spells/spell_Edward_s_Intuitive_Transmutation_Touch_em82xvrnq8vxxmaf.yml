  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You draw a transmutation circle around the target, invoking its
      alchemical composition and envisioning what it could become. You reshape
      the target into a new form made of the same substance, conserving mass.
      For example, you can reshape clothing into rope, electrum coins into gold
      and silver bars, bricks into a clay jar, or scrap metal into a
      weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>The quality of objects made by the spell is
      commensurate with the quality of the raw materials. Items requiring a high
      degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor) can only be
      created if you have proficiency with the type of tools used to craft such
      objects. Creatures and magic items canâ€™t be created or transmuted by this
      spell. Material which is part of a larger object (such as 2 cubic feet of
      bricks in a wall or the hinges of a locked door) cannot be targeted by
      this spell.</p><p><strong><em>Edward's Intuitive Transmutation
      Touch.</em></strong> The casting time of this spell is 1 action and it
      requires no material component. The target is an object up to Small-size,
      or up to 5 cubic feet of unattended raw material.</p>
