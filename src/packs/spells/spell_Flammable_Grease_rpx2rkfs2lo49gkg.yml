  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Grease erupts from a point that you can see within range and coats the
      ground in the area, turning it into difficult terrain until the spell
      ends.</p><p>When the grease appears, each creature within the area must
      succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters
      or ends its turn in the area must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
      or fall prone.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Flammable
      Grease.</strong> Until the spell ends, a creature that has made a saving
      throw against it gets grease on itself and becomes flammable. When the
      creature takes fire damage, it takes 1d6 ongoing fire damage until it uses
      an action to douse the flames.</p>
