      <p dir="ltr">You create a deep hole in a horizontal space you can see
      within range. The hole drops down 30 feet onto a floor of solid stone. If
      the surface the hole is created on isn&rsquo;t 30 feet thick (such as a
      floor over a basement), it simply bores a hole of the same size through
      the surface instead. Creatures on one of the spaces of the newly-created
      hole must make a Dexterity save or fall in, taking falling damage as
      usual. A creature that succeeds on its save is relocated to a space of its
      choice adjacent to the hole.</p>

      Higher Levels.</strong> For each spell slot level above 3rd, you may
      select one of the following enhancements: you may widen the hole by 5
      feet. You may deepen the hole by 10 feet. You may grease the sides of the
      hole, imposing disadvantage on checks to climb out of the hole. You may
      place acid, fire, and/or spikes (1 spell slot level for each) at the
      bottom, doing an additional 1d6 acid, fire, or piercing damage to
      creatures that fall into the hole.</p>
