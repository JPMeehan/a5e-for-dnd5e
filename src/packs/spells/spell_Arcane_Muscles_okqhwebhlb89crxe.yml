      <p>Your muscles swell with arcane power. They're too clumsy to effectively
      wield weapons but certainly strong enough for a powerful punch. Until the
      spell ends, you can choose to use your spellcasting ability score for
      Athletics checks, and for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes.
      In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and count as
      magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
      nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
