      <p dir="ltr">You summon up a set of heavy, spiked chains made of hellish
      metal to bind and constrict your foe.</p><p dir="ltr">When you cast this
      spell, a set of heavy metal chains covered in barbs wrap around the
      target, which must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the
      chains deal 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 psychic damage to the target. The
      creature is also grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC).&nbsp; A
      creature that succeeds on its save takes half damage and is still
      grappled, but rolls its attempts to escape with advantage.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Each time the target begins its turn grappled this way, the
      creature takes 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 psychic damage as the chains
      constrict them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-4d03dbe3-7fff-ca81-dc22-3206396c9449">Cast At
      Higher Levels. </strong>The initial damage increases by 1d6 piercing and
      1d6 psychic damage for each spell slot level above 3rd.</p><p
      dir="ltr"><strong>Rare: Chains of Heaven.</strong> The spell does radiant
      damage instead of psychic, is part of the Good school instead of the Evil
      school, and you may choose to have the chains do no damage.</p>
