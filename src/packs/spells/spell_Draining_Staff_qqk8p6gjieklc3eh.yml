      <p>A black magical quarterstaff appears in your hands, lasting for the
      duration of the spell. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you
      are proficient, and it has the <strong>Two-Handed</strong> property. It
      disappears if you drop it, but you can use a bonus action to recall
      it.</p>

      <p>You can also use this weapon normally as you would use any weapon, such
      as taking the attack action, use any eligible combat maneuver you would
      know, or use your reaction to make an opportunity attack.</p>

      <p>You can use an action to make a melee spell attack within the staff's
      reach. On a hit, you deal 2d6 necrotic damage, and you gain half as many
      temporary hit points as the damage dealt.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases
      by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p>
