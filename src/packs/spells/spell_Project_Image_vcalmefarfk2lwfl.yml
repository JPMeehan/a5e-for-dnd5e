  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that looks and sounds like
      you but is intangible. The duplicate can appear anywhere within range as
      long as you have seen the space before (it ignores any obstacles in the
      way).</p><p>You can use an action to move this duplicate up to twice your
      Speed and make it speak and behave in whatever way you choose, mimicking
      your mannerism with perfect accuracy. You can use a bonus action to see
      through your duplicate's eyes and hear through its ears until the
      beginning of your next turn. During this time, you are blind and deaf to
      your body's surroundings.</p><p>A creature can use an action to attempt an
      Investigation check against your spell save DC to reveal the spell's
      illusory nature. Physical interactions reveal the illusion for what it is
      as things can pass through it with ease. A creature aware of the illusion
      perceives the image as transparent and the sounds it generates hollow.</p>
