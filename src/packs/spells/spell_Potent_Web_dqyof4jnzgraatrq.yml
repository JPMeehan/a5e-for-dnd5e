    value: >-
      <p>Thick, sticky webs fill the area, lightly obscuring it and making it
      difficult terrain.</p><p>You must anchor the webs between two solid masses
      (such as walls or trees) or layer them across a flat surface. If you don't
      the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell
      ends.&nbsp;Webs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.</p><p>Each
      creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its
      turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained as long as it
      remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).</p><p>A creature
      restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength
      check against your spell save DC.</p><p>Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to
      fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that
      starts its turn in the fire.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When using a 4th-level spell slot, you also summon
      a@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.w7dd81so55c4is2n]{Giant Wolf
      Spider} in an unoccupied space within the web's area. When using a
      6th-level spell slot, you summon up to two spiders. When using a 7th-level
      spell slot, you summon up to three spiders. The spiders are friendly to
      you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spiders as a group, which
      have their own turns. The spiders obey your verbal commands, but they
      disappear when the spell ends or when they leave the web's
      area.</p><p><em><strong>Rare:</strong></em><strong>
      </strong><strong>Potent Web. </strong>Checks made by&nbsp;restrained
      creatures to escape the web have&nbsp;disadvantage.</p>
