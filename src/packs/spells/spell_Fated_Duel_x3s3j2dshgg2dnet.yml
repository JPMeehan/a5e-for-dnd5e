      <p dir="ltr">As you sing or play a rousing and recognizable leitmotif,
      your targets feel themselves drawn to one another, and they feel compelled
      to battle. Attacks made against the fated pair by other creatures are made
      with disadvantage. And the fated pair has disadvantage to strike anyone
      other than the other target of this spell. However, both members of the
      fated pair land a critical hit on an 18, 19, or 20 on any target so long
      as your concentration is maintained. Either target may choose to end this
      effect by surrendering to the other, and the effect also ends when one of
      the targets reaches 0 hit points or is otherwise incapacitated.</p><p

      Higher Levels.</strong> When cast at 4th, 6th, or 8th level you may
      designate an additional fated pair to battle.</p>
