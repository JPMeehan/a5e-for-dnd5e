  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A corpse explodes in a poisonous cloud. Each creature in a 10-foot
      radius of the corpse must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
      takes 3d6 thunder damage and is poisoned for 1 minute on a failed save, or
      it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned on a successful one. A
      poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, ending the effect for itself on a success.</p><p><strong><em>Cast
      at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You target an additional corpse for every
      2 slot levels above 1st.</p>
