  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A meteor ripped from diabolical skies streaks through the air and
      explodes at a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The spell
      fails if you can't see the point where the meteor explodes.</p><p>Each
      creature within range that can see the meteor (other than you) makes a
      Dexterity saving throw or is blinded until the end of your next turn.
      Fiery chunks of the meteor then plummet to the ground at different areas
      you choose within range. Each creature in an area makes a Dexterity saving
      throw, taking 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or
      half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in more than one area
      is affected only once.</p><p>The spell damages objects in the area and
      ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
