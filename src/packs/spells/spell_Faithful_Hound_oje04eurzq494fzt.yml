  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a phantasmal watchdog. Until the spell ends, the hound
      remains in the area unless you spend an action to dismiss it or you move
      more than 100 feet away from it.</p><p>The hound is invisible except to
      you and can't be harmed. When a Small or larger creature enters the area
      without speaking a password you specify when casting the spell, the hound
      starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures, can see into
      the Ethereal Plane, and is immune to illusions.</p><p>At the start of each
      of your turns, the hound makes a bite attack against a hostile creature of
      your choice that is within the area, using your spell attack bonus and
      dealing 4d8 piercing damage on a hit.</p>
