      <p>The spell summons forth a sumptuous feast with a cuisine of your
      choosing that provides 1 Supply for a number of creatures equal to twice
      your proficiency bonus. Consuming the food takes 1 hour and leaves a
      creature feeling nourished—it immediately makes a saving throw with
      advantage against any disease or poison it is suffering from, and it is
      cured of any effect that frightens it.</p><p>For up to 24 hours afterward
      the feast's participants have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, advantage
      on saving throws made against disease and poison, resistance against
      damage from poison and disease, and each increases its hit point maximum
      by 2d10.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Fantabulous
