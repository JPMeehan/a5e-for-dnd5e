      <p dir="ltr">You conjure a cloud of soap bubbles to obscure yourself.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The cloud of bubbles fills a 10-foot square and remains
      there, drifting peacefully, for one minute unless dispersed by a strong
      wind. While the bubbles are present, objects within the square or objects
      with the square between them and the viewer are lightly obscured. A
      creature with eyes that enters a square of bubbles or begins its turn in
      one square must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save
      DC or&nbsp; suffer disadvantage on Perception checks and ranged attacks
      until the beginning of its next turn. Beginning at 5th level, the bubbles
      become caustic, and a creature that fails its save also takes 1d4 acid
      damage. This increases to 2d4 at level 11 and 3d4 at level 17. Moving to a
      separate square of bubbles from the same caster does not impose a new
      save.</p>
