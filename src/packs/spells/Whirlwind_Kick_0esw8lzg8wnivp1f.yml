    value: >-
      <p>You must be able to move in order to cast this spell. You leap into the
      air and spin like a tornado, striking foes all around you with
      supernatural force as you fly up to 60 feet in a straight line. Your
      movement (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity) must end on a
      surface that can support your weight or you fall as normal.</p><p>As part
      of the casting of this spell, make a melee spell attack against any number
      of creatures in the area. On a hit, you deal your unarmed strike damage
      plus 2d6 thunder damage. In addition, creatures in the area make a
      Dexterity saving throw or are either pulled 10 feet closer to you or
      pushed 10 feet away (your choice).</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The extra thunder damage increases by 1d6 for each
      slot level above 3rd.</p>
