  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You throw a mushroom at a point within range and detonate it, creating
      a cloud of spores that fills the area. The cloud of spores travels around
      corners, and the area is considered lightly obscured for everyone except
      you. Creatures and objects within the area are covered in
      spores.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you know the exact location of all
      affected objects and creatures. Any attack roll you make against an
      affected creature or object has advantage, and the affected creatures and
      objects can't benefit from being
      invisible.</p><p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Poisonous
      Sporesight.&nbsp;</strong>Choose a&nbsp;number of creatures in the area
      equal to your&nbsp;proficiency bonus. Any other creature that
      starts&nbsp;its turn in the area or first enters into the area on&nbsp;a
      turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking&nbsp;2d6 poison damage on a
      failed save.</p>
