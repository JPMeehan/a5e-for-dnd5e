    value: >-
      <p>You magically transmute a mundane, harmless household item such as a
      rolling pin, wooden spoon, or broom into a weapon. For the duration, the
      item becomes metal and takes on the weapon properties of a club. You are
      considered proficient with clubs so long as you wield this weapon, it is
      considered to be a magic weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage
      resistances, and you may choose to use your Wisdom modifier for
      calculating your attack and damage rolls with it. The spell automatically
      ends if you let go of the target or are disarmed.</p>
