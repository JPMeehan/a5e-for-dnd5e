  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a sphere of poisonous, sickly green fog, which can spread
      around corners but not change shape. The area is heavily obscured. A
      strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell early.</p><p>Until the
      spell ends, when a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn
      or starts its turn there, it takes 5d8 poison damage.</p><p>The fog moves
      away from you 10 feet at the start of each of your turns, flowing along
      the ground. The fog is thicker than air, sinks to the lowest level in the
      land, and can even flow down openings and pits.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot
      level above 5th.</p>
