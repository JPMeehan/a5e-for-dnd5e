  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A weapon formed from the essence of Hell appears in your hands. You
      must use two hands to wield the weapon. If you let go of the weapon, it
      disappears and the spell ends.</p><p>When you cast the spell, choose
      either a flame fork or ice spear. While the spell lasts, you can use an
      action to make a melee spell attack with the weapon against a creature
      within 10 feet of you.</p><p>On a hit, you deal 5d8 damage of a type
      determined by the weapon's form. On a critical hit, you inflict an
      additional effect.</p><p>In addition, on a hit with the infernal weapon,
      you can end the spell early to inflict an automatic critical
      hit.</p><p><strong>Flame Fork.</strong> The weapon deals fire
      damage.</p><p>On a critical hit, the target catches fire, taking 2d6
      ongoing fire damage.</p><p><strong>Ice Spear. </strong>The weapon deals
      cold damage. On a critical hit, for 1 minute the target is
      slowed.</p><p>At the end of each of its turns a slowed creature can make a
      Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p><p>A creature reduced to 0 hit points by an infernal weapon
      immediately dies in a gruesome fashion.</p><p>For example, a creature
      killed by an ice spear might freeze solid, then shatter into a thousand
      pieces. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of the creature and
      who can see it when it dies must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure,
      a creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next
      turn.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Malevolent Infernal
      Weapon.</strong> The spell may take a third form.
      </p><p><strong>Malevolent Maul.</strong> The weapon deals psychic damage.
      On a critical hit, the target is confused. At the end of each of its
      turns, a confused creature can make an Intelligence saving throw, ending
      the effect on itself on a success.</p>
