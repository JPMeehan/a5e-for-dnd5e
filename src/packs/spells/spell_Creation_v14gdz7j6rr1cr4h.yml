  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You weave raw magic into a mundane physical object no larger than a
      5-foot cube. The object must be of a form and material you have seen
      before. Using the object as a material component for another spell causes
      that spell to fail.</p><p>The spell's duration is determined by the
      object's material. An object composed of multiple materials uses the
      shortest duration.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong>
      The size of the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above
      5th.</p>
