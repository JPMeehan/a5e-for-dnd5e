    value: >-
      <p>You instantly learn the ingredients list and preparation method for the
      item of food or drink targeted by this spell. For one hour after you cast
      the spell you retain perfect, detailed knowledge sufficient to perfectly
      recreate the serving of food or drink, including an accurate awareness of
      any contaminants (including vermin and poisons, but not disease) in the
      fare. Identifying such contaminants as harmful usually requires a DC 10
      Perception check, but the Narrator may use DC 15 for those that are
      uncommon, DC 20 for rare, or DC 25 for those that are truly unique. If
      preparing the food requires specialized expertise (such as intricate
      decorating skills or master-level knife work) you do not acquire these
      abilities, merely the knowledge that, if you had them, you could reproduce
      the food item. If you have a medium to write on, you can create an
      accurate recipe during the hour you retain knowledge of the food or
      drink.</p>
