  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can see and hear a specific creature that you choose. The
      difficulty of the saving throw for this spell is modified by your
      knowledge of the target and whether you possess a physical item with a
      connection to the target.</p><p>On a failed save, you can see and hear the
      target through an invisible sensor that appears within 10 feet of it and
      moves with the target. Any creature who can see invisibility or rolls a
      critical success on its saving throw perceives the sensor as a fist-sized
      glowing orb hovering in the air. Creatures cannot see or hear you through
      the sensor.</p><p>If you choose to target a location, the sensor appears
      at that location and is immobile.</p>
