    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You mark a creature outside your own power structure as one
      possessing extraordinary virtue or merit.</p><p dir="ltr">The marked
      creature gains a small glowing mark that sheds dim light in a 5-foot
      radius and gains an expertise die on Wisdom and Charisma ability checks
      for the duration as long as it behaves in accordance with the tenets of
      your faith, order, higher power, or similar while the mark is visible.
      While the mark persists, members of your faith, order, or similar can
      automatically perceive the mark, even through disguises or concealment,
      and will know its significance, causing the target to be treated with the
      same trust and regard as a full member of the organization. Its effective
      prestige also increases by +1 with sympathetic individuals and
      institutions for the duration of the spell.</p><p dir="ltr">If you attempt
      to cast this spell on a member of the same organization you belong to such
      as your religious order, knightly order, or a closely-allied one, it
      automatically fails and you suffer a level of strife. If you attempt to
      cast this spell on yourself, it fails and you gain 2 levels of strife.</p>
