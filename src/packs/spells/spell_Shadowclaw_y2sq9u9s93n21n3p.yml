      <p dir="ltr">With a snarl of anger you cast out a claw of darkness that
      grips your target&rsquo;s throat with ruthless talons.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">As a reaction to a creature within range casting a spell you
      attempt to interrupt the spell before it is cast. Make a ranged spell
      attack against your target to deal 2d6 necrotic damage. On a successful
      hit, the target must succeed at a concentration check in order to complete
      the spell that they are currently casting. If they fail, the spell slot is
      not expended, and they may choose to do something with the same action
      cost as the spell.</p>
