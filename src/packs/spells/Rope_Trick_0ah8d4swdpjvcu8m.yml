  description:
    value: >-
      <p>One end of the target rope rises into the air until it hangs
      perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end, a nearly imperceptible
      entrance opens to an extradimensional space that can fit up to 8 Medium or
      smaller creatures. The entrance can be reached by climbing the rope. Once
      inside, the rope can be pulled into the extradimensional space.</p><p>No
      spells or attacks can cross into or out of the extradimensional space.
      Creatures inside the extradimensional space can see out of a 3-foot-by-
      5-foot window centered on its entrance. Creatures outside the space can
      spot the entrance with a Perception check against your spell save DC. If
      they can reach it, creatures can pass in and out of the space.</p><p>When
      the spell ends, anything inside the extradimensional space falls to the
      ground.</p>
