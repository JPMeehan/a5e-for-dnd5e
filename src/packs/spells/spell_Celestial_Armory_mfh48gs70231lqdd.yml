      <p>You reach through a portal to a demiplane of infinite weaponry, and the
      armaments you pull arc forth like shooting stars. When you cast this
      spell, make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 30 feet. This
      attack produces a melee weapon of your choice made of magical energy from
      that dimension which hurtles at the target. On a hit, the target takes
      force damage equal to 1d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>

      <p>Until this spell ends, you can repeat this attack as a bonus action.
      Each weapon produced is considered an artifact for the purpose of
      bypassing various magical defenses. Weapons produced by this spell
      disappear after hitting or missing their target.</p>

      <p><strong>Cast At Higher Levels.</strong>&nbsp;If you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12
      for each slot level above 5th.</p>
