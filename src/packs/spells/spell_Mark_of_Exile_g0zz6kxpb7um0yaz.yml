    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You brand the target (which takes 1d4 points of fire damage)
      with a mark indicating they are forbidden from a place you specify. The
      specified location can be as small as a 5&rsquo; square or as large as a
      city. You must have the divine or legal authority to ban the creature from
      the location you specify or the spell fails.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Thereafter, whenever the creature enters the forbidden
      location, it feels a creeping sense of dread and very badly wants to
      leave. It is rattled for the first minute in the location. Thereafter, it
      must make a Wisdom saving throw every 10 minutes, becoming frightened of
      the location. If the creature manages to stay in the location for 30
      minutes, it must make a Charisma saving throw every 10 minutes thereafter
      (in addition to the Wisdom saving throw) or suffer 1d6 points of psychic
      damage. If it manages to stay for an hour or more, it must make an
      Intelligence saving throw (in addition to the Wisdom and Charisma saving
      throws) every 10 minutes or gain a level of strife.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">None of these penalties beyond the initial rattling effect
      persist if you or your allies prevent the creature from leaving.</p>
