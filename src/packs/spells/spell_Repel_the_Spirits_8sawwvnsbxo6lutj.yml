      <p>During the casting time of this spell, you perform a rite in order to
      keep spirits from bothering mortals. When you cast the spell, you choose
      one of the following effects, any targets of which must be within range
      during the entire casting.</p><ul><li><strong>Appease Spirits:</strong>
      You target one acre of land, filling it with scents, sights, and sounds
      pleasing to spirit kind. One Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead
      creature inhabiting the target area improves its disposition towards
      mortals. Such a hostile spirit must make a Wisdom save at disadvantage or
      it becomes indifferent, and such an indifferent spirit becomes friendly.
      The same parcel of land cannot benefit from this spell again until the
      next new moon, and the same spirit cannot be affected by this spell again
      for 1 year.</li><li><strong>Disguise from Spirits:</strong> You target one
      creature, anointing them with aromatic ointments to disguise them from the
      spirits. For the next week, the target gains an expertise die on
      Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, and disguise kit checks made against
      Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead
      creatures.</li><li><strong>Feed Spirits:</strong> You target one creature
      and provide a meal to sate the spirits which have influence over the
      target. For the next week, the target cannot be possessed or have their
      dreams adversely affected by any means short of a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.pe52jryde7ljobzq]{Wish} spell.
      The target can refresh the one week duration for themself for up to one
      year by ritually offering 1 Supply to the spirits (such as through
      burning, throwing into a river, or leaving in the woods on a
      platter).</li><li><strong>Frighten Spirits:</strong> You target one acre
      of land, filling it with scents, sights, and sounds frightful to spirit
      kind (garlic, drums, sacred iconography, prayers, etc.). For the next 24
      hours, whenever a Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead creature or
      a creature with the Etherealness trait attempts to enter 120 feet of the
      target, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
      of the target. This fear effect lasts until for 24 hours, during which
      time the affected creature can attempt its saving throw again each hour to
      end the effect early. Once a creature saves against this effect, it cannot
      be affected by this casting of it
      again.</li></ul><p><strong>Special.</strong> Druids can cast this spell as
      a ritual even if they do not have it prepared.</p>
