  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target becomes oven hot. Any creature touching the target takes 2d8
      fire damage when the spell is cast. Until the spell ends, on subsequent
      turns you can use a bonus action to inflict the same damage. If a creature
      is holding or wearing the target and suffers damage, it makes a
      Constitution saving throw or it drops the target. If a creature does not
      or cannot drop the target, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
      checks until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
      above 2nd.</p>
