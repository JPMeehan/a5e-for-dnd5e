  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an illusion that invokes the target's deepest fears. Only
      the target can see this illusion.</p><p>When the spell is cast and at the
      end of each of its turns, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw or takes
      4d10 psychic damage and becomes frightened.</p><p>The spell ends early
      when the target succeeds on its saving throw. A target that succeeds on
      its initial saving throw takes half damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot
      level above the 4th.</p>
