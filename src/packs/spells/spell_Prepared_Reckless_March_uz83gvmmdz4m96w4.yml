    value: >-
      <p>You suppress exhaustion in your traveling companions. Choose any number
      of creatures within range when you finish casting this spell. For the
      duration, they do not roll Constitution saving throws for a forced
      march.</p>

      <p>When this spell ends, the target creatures must roll a single
      Constitution saving throw against a difficulty of 10 + the number of hours
      of forced march undertaken during the spell. On a failure, they suffer
      levels of fatigue equal to half the number of hours of the forced march
      (minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> You target an additional
      creature for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><strong>Rare: Prepared Reckless March.<em> </em></strong>If you cast
      this spell with a slot of 4th level or higher, all targets have advantage
      on the Constitution saving throw when the spell ends. If the creature
      already has advantage on this check from another source, it instead gains
      an expertise die to the Constitution saving throw.</p>
