  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A transparent sphere of force encloses the target.</p>

      <p>The sphere is weightless and just large enough for the target to fit
      inside. The sphere can be destroyed without harming anyone inside by
      dispel magic cast using a spell slot of at least 4th-level or by being
      dealt at least 15 force damage in one round by a single attack or from a
      single effect. The sphere is immune to all other damage, and no spell
      effects, physical objects, or anything else can pass through, though a
      target can breathe while inside it. The target cannot be damaged by any
      attacks or effects originating from outside the sphere, and the target
      cannot damage anything outside of it.</p>

      <p>The target can use an action to roll the sphere at half its Speed.
      Similarly, the sphere can be picked up and moved by other creatures.</p>
