  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends or you use an action to end it, you step into the
      border regions of the Ethereal Plane where it overlaps with your current
      plane. While on the Ethereal Plane, you can move in any direction, but
      vertical movement is considered difficult terrain. You can see and hear
      the plane you originated from, but everything looks desaturated and you
      can see no further than 60 feet.</p><p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you
      can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane.
      Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you unless some special
      ability or magic explicitly allows them to.</p><p>When the spell ends, you
      immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you
      currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or
      creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest
      unoccupied space and you take force damage equal to twice the number of
      feet you are moved.</p><p>The spell has no effect if you cast it while you
      are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as an
      Outer Plane.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You
      can target up to 3 willing creatures within 10 feet (including you) for
      each slot level above 7th.</p>
