  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is transformed until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell
      ends. You can make the transformation permanent by concentrating on the
      spell for the full duration.</p>

      <p>Creature into Creature: The target's body is transformed into a
      creature with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the
      target doesn't have a Challenge Rating, use its level.</p>

      <p>The target's game statistics (including its hit points and mental
      ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature. The
      target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and
      it can&rsquo;t speak or cast spells, though its personality remains
      unchanged. If the target is changed into a creature with an alignment
      trait, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it gains that
      alignment trait for the duration of the spell. Otherwise, it keeps its own
      alignment trait. The target's gear melds into the new form. Equipment that
      merges with a target's form has no effect until it leaves the form.</p>

      <p>When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of
      hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell's effects on the
      target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries
      over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it
      to 0 hit points.</p>

      <p>Object into Creature: The target is transformed into any kind of
      creature, as long as the creature's size isn't larger than the object's
      size and it has a Challenge Rating of 9 or less. The creature is friendly
      to you and your allies and acts on each of your turns. You decide what
      action it takes and how it moves. The Narrator has the creature's
      statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.</p>

      <p>If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It
      might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.</p>

      <p>Creature into Object: You turn the target and whatever it is wearing
      and carrying into an object. The target's game statistics are replaced by
      the statistics of the chosen object. The target has no memory of time
      spent in this form, and when the spell ends it returns to its normal
      form.</p>
