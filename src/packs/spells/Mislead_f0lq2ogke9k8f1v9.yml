  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You become invisible. At the same time, an illusory copy of you appears
      where you're standing.</p><p>This invisibility ends when you cast a spell
      but the copy lasts until the spell ends.</p><p>You can use an action to
      move your copy up to twice your Speed, have it speak, make gestures, or
      behave however you'd like.</p><p>You may see and hear through your copy.
      Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to switch between your
      copy's senses and your own, or back again. While using your copy's senses
      you are blind and deaf to your body's surroundings.</p><p>The copy is
      revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects
      and creatures pass through it.</p>
