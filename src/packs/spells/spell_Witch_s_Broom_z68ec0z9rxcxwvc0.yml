      dir="ltr">You touch a broom and bring it to life. The broom stands and
      moves on its own, and will follow you unless commanded to stay in place.
      You may issue basic commands to the broom, such as instructing it on a
      specific spot that needs cleaning. If no commands are issued, the broom
      will start to idly clean the immediate area. An animated broom can
      completely sweep a 10-foot by 10-foot space in 1 minute, thoroughly
      removing dust, debris, and signs of foot traffic, such as tracks.</p>
