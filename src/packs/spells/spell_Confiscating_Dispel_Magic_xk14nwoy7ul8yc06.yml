      <p>You scour the magic from your target. Any spell cast on the target ends
      if it was cast with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower. For spells using a
      spell slot of 4th-level or higher, make an ability check with a DC equal
      to 10 + the spell's level for each one, ending the effect on a
      success.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You
      automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the level of the
      spell slot used to cast it is equal to or less than the level of the spell
      slot used to cast dispel magic.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Confiscating Dispel Magic.</strong> When you
      dispel a spell that was cast using a spell slot at least 2 levels lower
      than the one used for this spell, you can use your reaction to expend a
      spell slot of equal level to the dispelled spell and immediately cast it
      at a new target.</p>
