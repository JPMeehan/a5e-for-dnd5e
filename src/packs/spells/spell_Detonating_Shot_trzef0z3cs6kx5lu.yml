      <p>You charge a piece of ammunition with unstable energies. It will make
      quite the impression when it arrives…</p><p>As part of the action used to
      cast this spell, make a ranged weapon attack against a target within range
      of the weapon you are wielding. If you hit, the target takes normal weapon
      damage and the ammunition explodes on impact, dealing 2d6 piercing and 2d6
      thunder damage to each creature and unattended objects in the spell’s
      area. This detonation can be heard up to 300 feet from the point of
      impact.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> The thunder damage
      increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
