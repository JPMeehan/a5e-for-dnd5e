      <p dir="ltr">Your magic is just another tool like any other, and you use
      it constantly in your work. Choose one:</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You learn the accurate dimensions (to the
      nearest .1 inches) of an object that fits entirely within range.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You learn the accurate weight of an
      object (to the nearest .1 pounds) within range.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You learn the accurate (to the nearest
      degree) temperature of a surface you can see within range, a liquid you
      can see within range, or the ambient environment.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You learn if a substance within range is
      one or more of the following: toxic, flammable, and/or
      corrosive.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You learn where a manufactured object was
      made and by whom. This provides only the name of the place and the person
      who made it (or assembled it, in the case of an object made of multiple
      parts for different sources), not how to find either the location or
      person.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You convert up to a square foot of a
      matte surface to a polished one or vice versa. This can, among other
      things, render clear glass frosted and render frosted glass clear or
      polish metal to a mirror sheen.</p>
