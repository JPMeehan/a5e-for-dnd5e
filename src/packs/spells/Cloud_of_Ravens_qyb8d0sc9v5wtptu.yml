    value: >-
      <p>You transform yourself into a swarm of ravens for the duration. All
      items carried by you and equipment wielded by you merge into the swarm.
      While transformed, you retain your hit points and your Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma scores, but otherwise your consciousness is
      distributed among the ravens. The swarm may speak, but each word comes
      from a different raven or ravens, and if the communication is
      time-sensitive or there are distractions, a DC 5 Intelligence check is
      required to understand what you say. If the swarm disperses or you are
      reduced to 0 hit points, you immediately return to your normal form. You
      can also return to your normal form as a bonus action, ending the spell
      early.</p>
