    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">Your weapon reverberates with powerful magic, ready to strike
      with deafening power.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack after you
      cast this spell the sound of a massive&nbsp; bell fills the air and the
      blow deals an additional 3d6 points of Thunder damage and all creatures
      within 20 feet of the target of your attack must make a Constitution
      saving throw or be deafened for a minute. The target makes this saving
      throw with disadvantage. The clang is so loud, it can be heard a mile away
      with no check required and can be heard up to 5 miles away with a DC 10
      Perception check. The spell then ends.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-9d1f1404-7fff-f008-dd5c-c078ada69a57">Cast at
      Higher Levels</strong>. If you cast this spell with at least a 2nd-level
      spell slot, creatures that fail their save against the deafening effect
      also take 1d6 points of Thunder damage. If you cast this spell with at
      least a 3rd-level spell slot, the initial attack and area damage both
      increase by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2nd.</p>
