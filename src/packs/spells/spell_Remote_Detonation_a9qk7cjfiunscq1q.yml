      <p dir="ltr">You point to a triggerable item and set it off with a small
      magical boost.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">This spell causes an item that would normally need to be
      thrown, smashed, or ignited to go off on its own. Examples of items that
      can be triggered include acid flasks, alchemist&rsquo;s fire, black powder
      charges, flash bombs, holy water, oil, paint pots, smoke bombs, tanglefoot
      bags, unstable arcanum, and other similar items at the Narrator&rsquo;s
      discretion. The item has its usual effects, but the damage (if any)
      increases by 1d6, the saves imposed by it (if any) rise to match your
      spell save DC, and the affected area becomes a 10-foot circle if it would
      normally be smaller. If the item is carried or worn by another creature,
      the creature can stop the item from detonating with a successful
      Intelligence saving throw.</p>
