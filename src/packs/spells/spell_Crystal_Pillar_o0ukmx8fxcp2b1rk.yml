  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Choose an unoccupied space between you and the source of the attack
      which triggers the spell. You call forth a pillar of earth or stone (3
      feet diameter, 20 feet tall, AC 10, 20 hit points) in that space that
      provides you with three-quarters cover (+5 to AC, Dexterity saving throws,
      and ability checks made to hide).</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Crystal Pillar.</strong> The pillar summoned by
      this spell is made of translucent crystal. If this spell causes an attack
      to miss, the attack hits the pillar instead. If this pillar is destroyed,
      every creature within 5 feet of it takes 2d6 piercing damage.</p>
