      <p dir="ltr">You sacrifice your own life force to heal another. When you
      cast this spell, you suffer 4d8 points of necrotic damage that cannot be
      reduced or negated by any means and your maximum hit points are reduced by
      an equal amount until you finish a long rest. The target recovers a number
      of hit points equal to twice the damage taken. If this damage drops you to
      zero hit points, you begin with a failed death save. If this reduces your
      maximum hit points to zero, you die immediately.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You may also optionally choose to purge a disease or poison
      from the creature at the cost of taking it on yourself at the same time
      you heal the target. When you cast this spell, you may remove a disease or
      poison from the target, which immediately affects you as if you had just
      failed a saving throw against it.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-b38150bf-7fff-310b-0d55-9e21545e7618">Cast at
      Higher Levels.</strong> For each spell slot level above 3rd, increase the
      damage by 1d8 and increase the number of diseases or poisons you can
      absorb by 1.</p>
