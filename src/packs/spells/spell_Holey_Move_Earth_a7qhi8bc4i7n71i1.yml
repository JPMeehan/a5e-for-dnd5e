    value: >-
      <p>You reshape the area, changing its elevation or creating and
      eliminating holes, walls, and pillars.&nbsp;The only limitation is that
      the elevation change may not exceed half the area's horizontal
      dimensions.&nbsp;For example, affecting a 40-by-40 area allows you to
      include 20 foot high pillars, holes 20 feet deep, and changes in terrain
      elevation of 20 feet or less.&nbsp;Changes that result in unstable terrain
      are subject to collapse.</p><p>Changes take 10 minutes to complete, after
      which you can choose another area to affect. Due to the slow speed of
      transformation, it is nearly impossible for creatures to be hurt or
      captured by the spell.</p><p>This spell has no effect on stone, objects
      crafted from stone, or plants, though these objects will shift based on
      changes in the
      area.</p><p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Holey Move
      Earth.&nbsp;</strong>The spell&rsquo;s&nbsp;duration is instantaneous and
      it no longer requires&nbsp;your concentration. You affect up to 4 areas
      but&nbsp;only make caverns or holes (determined at the&nbsp;time of
      casting), each of which must be 20-foot&nbsp;cubes or smaller.</p>
