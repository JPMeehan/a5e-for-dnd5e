  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A cloud of burning embers, smoke, and roiling flame appears within
      range. The cloud heavily obscures its area, spreading around corners and
      through cracks. When the cloud appears and a creature is in it, when a
      creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn, or when a creature
      ends its turn within the cloud it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking
      10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful
      one.</p><p>The cloud can be dispelled by a wind of at least 10 miles per
      hour. After it is cast, the cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a
      direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.</p><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Clinging Incendiary
      Cloud.</strong> Until the spell ends, burning embers stick to any
      creatures caught within the cloud. A creature that fails a saving throw
      against the spell takes 1d8 ongoing fire damage. A creature outside of the
      cloud can use an action to brush the embers off.</p>
