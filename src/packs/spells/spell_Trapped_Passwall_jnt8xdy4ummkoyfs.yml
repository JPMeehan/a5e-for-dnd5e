    value: >-
      <p><em><strong>Target:&nbsp;</strong>Plaster, stone, or wooden
      surface</em></p><p>Until the spell ends, you create a passage extending
      into the target surface. When creating the passage you define its
      dimensions, as long as they do not exceed 5 feet in width, 8 feet in
      height, or 20 feet in depth.&nbsp;The appearance of the passage has no
      effect on the stability of the surrounding environment.</p><p>Any
      creatures or objects within the passage when the spell ends are expelled
      without harm into unoccupied spaces near where the spell was
      cast.</p><p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Trapped
      Passwall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Within a&nbsp;number of rounds equal to your
      proficiency&nbsp;bonus, the passage left by this spell (which can&nbsp;be
      as minimal as an inch depression) becomes&nbsp;trapped. Choose one of the
      following:</p><p><em><strong>Slippy.</strong></em> One side of the passage
      is covered in slippery soap. When a creature enters the passage&rsquo;s
      area or first moves through the area on a turn it must make a Dexterity
      saving throw or fall prone.</p><p><em><strong>Sticky.</strong></em> Goo
      covers one side of the passage, making it difficult
      terrain.</p><p><em><strong>Subtle.</strong> </em>An illusion covers the
      passage making it appear as if nothing has happened to the target surface.
      The illusion does not hold up to physical inspection. A creature that
      tries to push against the illusion, for example, instead passes straight
      through the figment. To see through your illusion without such an
      inspection, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check
      against your spell save DC.</p>
