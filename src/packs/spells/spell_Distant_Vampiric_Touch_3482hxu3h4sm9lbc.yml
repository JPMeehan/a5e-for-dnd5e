    value: >-
      <p>Shadows roil about your hand and heal you by siphoning away the life
      force from others. On the round you cast it, and as an action on
      subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can make a melee spell attack
      against a creature within your reach.</p>

      <p>On a hit, you deal 3d6 necrotic damage and regain hit points equal to
      half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases
      by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Distant Vampiric
      Touch.&nbsp;</strong>Instead of&nbsp;making melee spell attacks, you make
      ranged spell&nbsp;attacks (range 10/20 ft.) in the form of
      shadowy&nbsp;lines that streak from your hand.</p>
