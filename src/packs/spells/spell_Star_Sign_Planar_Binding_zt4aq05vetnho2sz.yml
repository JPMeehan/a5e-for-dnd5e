  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em><strong>Target:</strong> One aberration, celestial, elemental, fey,
      or fiend</em></p>

      <p>The target must remain within range for the entire casting of the spell
      (usually by means of a magic circle spell). Until the spell ends, you
      force the target to serve you. If the target was summoned through some
      other means, like a spell, the duration of the original spell is extended
      to match this spell's duration.</p>

      <p>Once it is bound to you the target serves as best it can and follows
      your orders, but only to the letter of the instruction. A hostile or
      malevolent target actively seeks to take any advantage of errant phrasing
      to suit its nature. When a target completes a task you've assigned to it,
      if you are on the same plane of existence the target travels back to you
      to report it has done so. Otherwise, it returns to where it was bound and
      remains there until the spell ends.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a 6th-level
      spell slot, its duration increases to 10 days. When using a 7th-level
      spell slot, its duration increases to 30 days. When using an 8th-level
      spell slot, its duration increases to 180 days. When using a 9th-level
      spell slot, its duration increases to a year and a day.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Star Sign Planar
      Binding.&nbsp;</strong>The spell can&nbsp;also target an aberration.</p>
