    value: >-
      <p>If any creature used teleportation or plane shift magic, such as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.c9j5g49kht85ek3u]{Dimension Door}
      or<em> @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.xy18ntmvnsrgsor4]{Teleportation
      Circle}</em>, to leave the spell&rsquo;s area within the past 24 hours, a
      glowing rift appears in the space from which they left. If multiple spells
      have been cast within this period, only the most recent rift
      materializes.</p>

      <p>A rift resembles a glowing, opaque circle of light through which its
      destination can&rsquo;t be seen. The rift remains open until the end of
      your next turn. During this time, any creature can pass through the rift.
      When they enter the rift, they are teleported to the destination of the
      original teleportation effect that was used to leave the area. If the
      destination is currently occupied, the creature takes 16 (3d10) force
      damage and appears in the closest unoccupied space to the destination.
      Creatures that enter the rift cannot use it to return, though as long as
      it is within 24 hours of the target spell&rsquo;s casting you can choose
      to cast this spell a second time to reopen your last rift instead of
      opening a new one, regardless of what other teleportation effects have
      been used in the area in the meantime.</p>
