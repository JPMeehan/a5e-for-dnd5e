  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an illusory Large creature with an appearance determined by
      you that comes into being with all the necessary equipment needed to use
      it as a mount. This equipment vanishes when more than 10 feet away from
      the creature.</p>

      <p>You or any creature you allow may ride the steed, which uses the
      statistics for a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.24s1s7jliagjldpg]{Riding Horse}
      but has a Speed of 100 feet and travels at 10 miles per hour at a steady
      pace (13 miles per hour at a fast pace).</p>

      <p>The steed vanishes if it takes damage (disappearing instantly) or you
      use an action to dismiss it (fading away, giving the rider 1 minute to
      dismount).</p>

      <p><strong><em>Rare:&nbsp;</em>Carting Phantom
      Steed.&nbsp;</strong>Instead of&nbsp;conjuring a mount, you conjure a
      Large vehicle&nbsp;such as a boat, wagon, or cart. You decide on&nbsp;its
      appearance. If the vehicle normally requires&nbsp;horses, quasi-real
      beasts with an appearance of&nbsp;your choosing are conjured along with
      it. The&nbsp;vehicle can transport up to 6 Medium creatures.</p>
