      <p dir="ltr">You enhance the properties of your weapon, making it deadlier
      to your foes.</p><p dir="ltr">If the weapon deals piercing damage, it
      deals an additional 1d6 poison damage for the duration. If it deals
      slashing damage, the weapon deals 1d4 ongoing damage for one minute on a
      hit until an action is spent to stanch the bleeding or the target receives
      magical healing (a creature can only have one instance of this ongoing
      damage at a time). If the weapon normally deals bludgeoning damage, it
      deals force damage instead. In all cases, the damage done by the weapon is
      considered magical.</p>
