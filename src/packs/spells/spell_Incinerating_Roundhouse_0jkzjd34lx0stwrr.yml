      <p dir="ltr">You must be able to move in order to cast this spell. You
      lash out with a kick so terrible in its decisiveness that it sets the very
      air ablaze. As part of casting the spell, make a melee spell attack
      against a creature within reach of your unarmed strike. If you hit, you
      deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting modifier plus 3d6
      fire damage. If your unarmed strike normally uses a larger die, use that
      instead of a d6.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-4df88659-7fff-c4a3-f906-2555f9b29893">Cast At
      Higher Levels.&nbsp;</strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot
      of 3rd level or higher, the spell does an extra 1d6 fire damage for each
      spell level above 2nd. If you cast the spell with a spell slot of 5th
      level or higher, a creature you damage also catches fire and takes 1d6
      ongoing fire damage at the start of each of its turns until an action is
      taken to extinguish the flames.</p>
