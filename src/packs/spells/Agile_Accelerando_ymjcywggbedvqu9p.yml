      <p>You play a complex and quick up-tempo piece that gradually gets faster
      and more complex, instilling the targets with its speed. You cannot cast
      another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this
      spell.</p><p>Until the spell ends, targets gain cumulative benefits the
      longer you maintain concentration on this spell (including the turn you
      cast it).</p><ul><li><p><strong>1 Round:</strong> Double

      weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object
