      <p dir="ltr">You create a pair of stilts under your feet and grants you
      supernatural balance to use them.</p><p dir="ltr">While the stilts are in
      place, you can walk through hazardous liquid up to 10 feet deep without
      suffering ill effects, your height is 10 feet taller (and so you can reach
      or see over things further off the ground), you have disadvantage on
      Stealth checks, and you gain a vicious kick that functions as melee spell
      attack which deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage + your spellcasting modifier
      and has a reach of 10 feet.</p><p dir="ltr">Your stilts have hit points
      equal to your proficiency bonus + your caster level and an AC equal to
      your spell save DC. If your stilts are destroyed or dispelled, you fall.
      If you attempt to cast this spell in a location which would not
      accommodate your new height, it fails.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-c249d3a2-7fff-9f83-1846-eaf106ebf190">Cast at
      Higher Levels.</strong> The height of the stilts increases by 5 feet for
      every spell slot level above 1st, as does the reach of the kick attack. If
      you cast this spell with at least a 3rd-level spell slot, your movement
      speed increases by 10 feet. This increase occurs again at spell slot
      levels 5, 7, and 9. If you use at least a 4th-level spell slot to cast the
      spell, your stilts become spectral and can no longer be damaged, though
      the can still be dispelled. They also deal force damage instead of
      bludgeoning, and creatures on the ground must be at least Large size or
      use a reach weapon in order to target you with melee attacks. If you cast
      this spell with at least a 6th level spell slot, the attack damage
      increases to 2d10 and creatures on the ground must be at least Huge size
      or use a reach weapon in order to target you with melee attacks.</p>
