      <p>Upon casting the spell, you instantly freeze the area, coating
      everything in a layer of ice. Creatures in the area take 6d6 damage and
      are restrained. Creatures that make their Constitution save take half
      damage and are not restrained. The area becomes difficult terrain until
      the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>On the beginning of your next turn,
      the area erupts with intense flames, rapidly expanding the super chilled
      air. Creatures in the area take 6d6 fire damage and are pushed 30 feet
      away from the center of the sphere. Creatures that make their dexterity
      save take half damage and are not pushed. If a pushed creature&rsquo;s
      movement is interrupted by a solid object, the creature and object take
      3d6 damage.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> Increase each
      instance of damage by 1d6 for every slot level above 8th.</p>
