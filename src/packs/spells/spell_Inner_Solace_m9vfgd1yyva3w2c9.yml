      <p>You turn a creature's exhaustion into a well of inner strength. While
      under the effect of this spell, the target gains a number of temporary hit
      points equal to 1d6 &times; its combined levels of fatigue and strife at
      the start of each of its turns. Any temporary hit points remaining are
      lost when the spell ends.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if its total levels of fatigue and strife are 3 or more,
      the target gains advantage on its first attack roll each turn.</p>
