    value: >-
      <p>You create a gate of swirling flame and step through, pulling the
      flames in behind you. You reappear on any space you can see in range and
      creatures within 10 feet of your arrival location must make a Dexterity
      save or suffer 3d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 ongoing fire damage for
      the next minute unless an action is spent to douse the flames. Creatures
      that succeed on their save take half damage and do not suffer ongoing
      damage.</p>
