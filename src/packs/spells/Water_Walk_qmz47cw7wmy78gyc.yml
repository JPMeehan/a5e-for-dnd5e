  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, the targets are able to move across any liquid
      surface (such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava) as if it was
      solid ground.</p><p>Creatures can still take damage from surfaces that
      would deliver damage from corrosion or extreme temperatures, but they do
      not sink while moving across it.</p><p>A target submerged in a liquid is
      moved to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per
      round.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The duration
      increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
