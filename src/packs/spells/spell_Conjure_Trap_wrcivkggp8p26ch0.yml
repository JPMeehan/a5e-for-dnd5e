    value: >-
      <p>You ward a 5-foot square of non-magical ground within range with a
      magical trap, chosen from the list below. Once after this spell is cast,
      when a creature you can see enters or begins its turn within the warded
      area, you can use your reaction to spring the trap. The effect on the
      creature depends on the trap you chose.</p><ul><li><p><em>Explosion</em>:
      This spell creates a trap of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.4t0m2ttaca5hg2vi]{Alchemist's
      Fire} that falls on or launches at the creature, which must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire on a failed save, or half as
      much on a successful one.</p></li><li><p><em>Pitfall</em>: This spell
      creates a 5 feet-wide and 15 feet deep pitfall trap beneath the creature,
      which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the
      creature falls into the pitfall. On a success, the creature falls prone
      adjacent to the pitfall. This pitfall cannot be created through material
      harder than earth (such as wood and stone).. Otherwise the hole is
      well-constructed and lasts even after the spell's duration. Flying
      creatures are unaffected by this trap.</p></li><li><p><em>Snare</em>: This
      spell creates a snare of rope, wire, vine, or webs that entangle the
      creature, which make a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature
      has advantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
      1d6 slashing damage and is restrained until the start of its next turn. On
      a success, the creature takes half as much damage and ends its
      movement.</p></li></ul><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the effects
      increase, based on effect.</p><ul><li><p><em>Explosion</em>. The damage
      increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 1st. If cast using a
      spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, this spell targets creatures in a
      sphere within range, the radius of which is 5 feet for every two spell
      slot levels above 1st.</p></li><li><p><em>Pitfall</em>. The depth of the
      pitfall increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 1st. If cast
      using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the pit is 5 feet wider for
      each two spell slot levels above 1st. This spell affects wooden material
      if cast using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, and stone with
      4th-level or higher.</p></li><li><p><em>Snare</em>. The damage increases
      by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1st. If cast using a spell of 3rd
      level or higher, Large creatures no longer have advantage on their saving
      throw. This size category increases for every two spell levels above
      1st.</p></li></ul>
