  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You inscribe a potent glyph on the target, setting a magical trap for
      your enemies. If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original
      position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have
      cast, the spell ends. Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Investigation
      check against your spell save DC.</p><p>Describe the actions a creature
      must perform to trigger the spell, such as approaching within a certain
      distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or
      seeing or reading the glyph. The creature must have a clear path to the
      glyph to trigger it. You can specify certain creatures which don't trigger
      the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a
      certain phrase. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.</p><p>When
      triggered, the glyph sheds dim light in a 60-foot radius for 10 minutes,
      after which the spell ends. Each creature within the sphere's area is
      targeted by the glyph, as are creatures that enter the sphere for the
      first time on a turn.</p><p>When you cast the spell, choose one of the
      following effects.</p><p>Death: Creatures in the area make a Constitution
      saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
      much on a successful save.</p><p>Discord: Creatures in the area make a
      Constitution saving throw or bicker and argue with other creatures for 1
      minute. While bickering, a creature cannot meaningfully communicate and it
      has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p><p>Confused:
      Creatures in the area make an Intelligence saving throw or become confused
      for 1 minute.</p><p>Fear: Creatures in the area make a Wisdom saving throw
      or are frightened for 1 minute.</p><p>While frightened, a creature drops
      whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph
      on each of its turns.</p><p>Hopelessness: Creatures in the area make a
      Charisma saving throw or become overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute.
      While despairing, a creature can't attack or target any creature with
      harmful features, spells, traits, or other magical effects.</p><p>Pain:
      Creatures in the area make a Constitution saving throw or become
      incapacitated for 1 minute.</p><p>Sleep: Creatures in the area make a
      Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes.</p><p>A sleeping
      creature awakens if it takes damage or an action is used to wake
      it.</p><p>Stunning: Creatures in the area make a Wisdom saving throw or
      become stunned for 1 minute.</p>
