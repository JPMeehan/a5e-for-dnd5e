      <p dir="ltr">With a wave of your hand, your targets become the absolute
      -height- of fashion and taste within the community you are standing in.
      Nothing about them changes visibly, but the tastes of the area suddenly
      focus on whatever sartorial style they possess, their accents, and their
      favored music and foods. Mystical rumors spread across the community about
      your targets. Choose one of the following skills for each target:
      Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, or Persuasion. So long as
      the spell is in effect, your targets have expertise in their chosen skill,
      and their prestige is treated as 2 points higher.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, no permanent
      resident of the community is aware that magic was used, and goes about
      their business as normal. Visitors, however, may notice the strange
      deference given.</p>
