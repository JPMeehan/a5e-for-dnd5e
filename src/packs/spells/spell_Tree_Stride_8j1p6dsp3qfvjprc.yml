      <p>Until the spell ends, once per round you can use 5 feet of movement to
      enter a living tree and move to inside another living tree of the same
      kind within 500 feet so long as you end your turn outside of a tree. Both
      trees must be at least your size. You instantly know the location of all
      other trees of the same kind within 500 feet. You may step back outside of
      the original tree or spend 5 more feet of movement to appear within a spot
      of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree. If you have no
      movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.</p>
