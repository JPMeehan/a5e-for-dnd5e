      dir="ltr">You magically flood the area with honey, jam, or some other
      sticky substance. For the duration of the spell, this area counts as
      difficult terrain and any creature entering the area for the first time
      must make a Strength saving throw versus your spell save DC or be knocked
      prone as they slip and fall. While a creature is knocked prone in this
      way, they are also restrained. Creatures knocked prone may repeat their
      saving throw at the beginning of their turn and are no longer prone or
      restrained on a success.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Creatures that succeed on their Strength saving throw still
      have whatever limbs that came into contact with the sticky surface covered
      in the substance. On their turn they may make an Athletics check to adhere
      themselves to vertical surfaces and climb them, as per the spider climb
      spell. This effect lasts so long as you are able to maintain
      concentration. If a creature is adhered to a surface when the spell ends,
      they immediately fall.</p>
