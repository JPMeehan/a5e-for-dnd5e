      <p><em><strong>Association:</strong> Fighter class</em></p><p>The harder
      you fight, the tougher it is to keep you down.</p><p>While this spell is
      active, keep a running total of the exertion you spend. Until the spell
      ends, the first death saving throw you make after falling
      unconscious&nbsp; gains a bonus equal to your total exertion spent. If the
      result of this death save is 20 or more, treat the result as if you had
      rolled a 20.&nbsp;</p>
