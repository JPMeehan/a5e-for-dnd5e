  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is imbued with a spoken message of 25 words or fewer which
      it speaks when a trigger condition you choose is met. The message may take
      up to 10 minutes to convey.</p><p>When your trigger condition is met, a
      magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in the same
      voice and volume as you used when instructing it. If the object chosen has
      a mouth (for example, a painted portrait) this is where the mouth
      appears.</p><p>You may choose upon casting whether the message is a single
      event, or whether it repeats every time the trigger condition is
      met.</p><p>The trigger condition must be based upon audio or visual cues
      within 30 feet of the object, and may be highly detailed or as broad as
      you choose.</p><p>For example, the trigger could be when any attack action
      is made within range, or when the first spring shoot breaks ground within
      range.</p>
