    value: >-
      <p>You surround yourself with a dampening magical field and collect the
      energy of a foe's attack to use against them. When you take damage from a
      weapon attack, you can end the spell to halve the attack's damage against
      you, gaining a retribution charge that lasts until the end of your next
      turn. By expending the retribution charge when you hit with a melee
      attack, you deal an additional 2d10 force damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast
      at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You may use your reaction to halve the
      damage of an attack against you up to a number of times equal to the level
      of the spell slot used, gaining a retribution charge each time that lasts
      until 1 round after the spell ends.</p><p>You must still make Constitution
      saving throws to maintain your concentration on this spell, but you do so
      with advantage, or if you already have advantage, you automatically
      succeed.</p>
