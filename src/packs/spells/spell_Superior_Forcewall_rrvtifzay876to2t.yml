  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an invisible wall of force at a point you choose. The wall
      is a horizontal or vertical barrier, or at an angle. It can be free
      floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a
      hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You
      may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of
      ten 10-foot square sections. The wall is 1/4 inch thick.</p>

      <p>If the wall enters a creature's space when it appears, the creature is
      pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be
      surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid
      surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move
      up to its Speed to escape. Any creature without a special sense like
      blindsight has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>

      <p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall.&nbsp;It can be destroyed
      with @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel
      Magic} cast using a spell slot of at least 5th-level or by being dealt at
      least 25 force damage at once. It is otherwise immune to damage. The wall
      also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through
      it.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Superior
      Forcewall.&nbsp;</strong>Creatures pushed&nbsp;to one side of the wall are
      knocked prone. The&nbsp;wall can be destroyed with a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel Magic} cast
      using a spell slot of at least 6th-level or by being&nbsp;dealt at least
      50 force damage at once. It is otherwise&nbsp;immune to damage.</p>
