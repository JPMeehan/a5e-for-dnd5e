  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, the targets leave their material bodies
      (unconscious and in a state of suspended animation, not aging or requiring
      food or air) and project astral forms that resemble their mortal forms in
      nearly all ways, keeping their game statistics and
      possessions.</p><p>While in this astral form you trail a tether, a
      silvery-white cord that sprouts from between your shoulder blades and
      fades into immateriality a foot behind you. As long as the tether remains
      intact you can find your way back to your material body. When it is
      cut&mdash;which requires an effect specifically stating that it cuts your
      tether &mdash;your soul and body are separated and you immediately die.
      Damage against and other effects on your astral form have no effect on
      your material body either during this spell or after its duration ends.
      Your astral form travels freely through the Astral Plane and can pass
      through interplanar portals on the Astral Plane leading to any other
      plane. When you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when
      casting this spell, your material body and possessions are transported
      along the tether, allowing you to return fully intact with all your gear
      as you enter the new plane.</p><p>The spell ends for all targets when you
      use an action to dismiss it, for an individual target when a successful
      dispel magic is cast upon its astral form or material body, or when either
      its material body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points. When the spell
      ends for a target and the tether is intact, the tether pulls the target's
      astral form back to its material body, ending the suspended
      animation.</p><p>If the spell ends for you prematurely, other targets
      remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their
      bodies (usually by dropping to 0 hit points).</p>
