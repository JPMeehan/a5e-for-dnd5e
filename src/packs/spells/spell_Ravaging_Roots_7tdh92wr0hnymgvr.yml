    value: >-
      <p>Roots erupt out of an earth or stone surface that you can see within
      range, swelling as they smash stone and displace earth. When the spell
      ends, the roots wither away, but the damage remains.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Creatures</strong></em>: A creature that starts its turn in
      the area makes a Dexterity saving throw or is restrained by the roots,
      taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature already restrained by the roots
      automatically fails this saving throw. A creature can use its action to
      make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself or
      another creature on a success.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Ground</strong></em>: Ground and floors in the area (and
      underneath ceilings in the area, if you cast the spell on a ceiling)
      become difficult terrain.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Walls and Ceilings</strong></em>: Constructed walls and
      ceilings in the area take 5d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of
      your turns while the spell lasts. A structure reduced to 0 hit points by
      this spell collapses. Most structures of worked stone have around 27
      (5d10) hit points per 10-foot-square section, while natural walls and
      ceilings have half as many hit points.</p>

      <p>When a wall or ceiling collapses, the spell ends early. Each creature
      in or directly beneath the spell&rsquo;s area makes a Dexterity saving
      throw. On a failure, it takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone,
      and is buried by rubble. A creature buried by rubble that is underground
      is also unable to breathe. A creature can use its action to make a
      Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself or another
      creature on a success.</p>
