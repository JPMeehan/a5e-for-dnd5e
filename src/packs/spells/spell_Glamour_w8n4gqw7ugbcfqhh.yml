    value: >-
      <p>You distort light and colors around yourself so that you are subtly
      more appealing, masking any untoward marks and blemishes. Until the spell
      ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you are glamored by an illusion
      that can slightly alter your appearance. These minor changes include hair
      style and length, eye coloration, sex, signs of age or tiredness such as
      crows feet and bags under the eyes, concealing or adding tattoos or other
      marks or blemishes, and general signs of hygiene and cleanliness. You
      cannot change the perception of your height or heritage with this spell or
      disguise yourself as a creature of a different size category, and your
      limb structure remains the same; for example if you&rsquo;re bipedal, you
      can&rsquo;t use this spell to appear as a quadruped.</p>

      <p>The glamour does not hold up to physical inspection. A creature that
      tries to grab illusory hair, for example, finds its hand passes straight
      through the figment. To see through your glamour without such an
      inspection, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check
      against your&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">spell save</span> DC.</p>

      <p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> The duration of this spell
      increases when you reach 5th level (30 minutes) and 11th level (1
      hour).</p>
