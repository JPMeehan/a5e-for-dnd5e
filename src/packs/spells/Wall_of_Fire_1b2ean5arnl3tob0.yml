  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of fire on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60
      feet long (it does not have to be a straight line; sections of the wall
      can angle as long as they are contiguous), 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick,
      or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot
      thick. The wall blocks sight.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature
      within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>One side
      of the wall (chosen when the spell is cast) deals 5d8 fire damage to each
      creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the
      wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall itself for
      the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the
      wall deals no damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
      above 4th.</p>
