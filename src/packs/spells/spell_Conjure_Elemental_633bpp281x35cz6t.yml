  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a creature from the Elemental Planes. This creature uses the
      statistics of a conjured elemental creature with certain traits determined
      by your choice of its type:
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.zle9dpkdefj82yjx]{Conjured
      Elemental (Air)},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.qexbhk95fhowavm9]{Conjured
      Elemental (Earth)},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.u89w4shtjno3ohgw]{Conjured
      Elemental (Fire)}, or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.xt61pukm4rzhc2tz]{Conjured
      Elemental (Water)}.</p>

      <p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn
      immediately after yours.</p>

      <p>It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only
      defends itself.</p>

      <p>The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your
      concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the
      elemental creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your
      companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned
      it.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level
      above 5th the elemental creature's AC increases by 1, its hit points
      increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra
      damage.</p>
