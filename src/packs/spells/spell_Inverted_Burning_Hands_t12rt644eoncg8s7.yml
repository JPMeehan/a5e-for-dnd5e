  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched hands. Each
      creature in the area takes 3d6 fire damage. The fire ignites any flammable
      unattended objects in the area.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
      above 1st.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Inverted
      Burning Hands.</strong> The spell deals cold damage instead of fire
      damage, creatures in the area make a Constitution saving throw instead of
      a Dexterity saving throw, and the area becomes difficult terrain for 1
      minute as it is covered in hoarfrost.</p>
