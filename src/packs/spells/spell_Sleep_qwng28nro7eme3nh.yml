    value: >-
      <p>You send your enemies into a magical slumber.</p><p>Starting with the
      target with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures),
      targets within the area fall unconscious in ascending order according to
      their hit points. Slumbering creatures stay asleep until the spell ends,
      they take damage, or someone uses an action to physically wake
      them.</p><p>As each target falls asleep, subtract its hit points from the
      total before moving on to the next target.</p><p>A target's hit points
      must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have
      any effect.</p><p>If the spell puts no creatures to sleep, the creature in
      the area with the lowest hit point total is rattled until the beginning of
      its next turn.</p><p>Constructs and undead are not affected by this
      spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The spell
      affects an additional 2d10 hit points worth of creatures for each slot
      level above 1st.</p>
