  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A metallic disc made of force, 3 feet in diameter and hovering 3 feet
      off the ground, appears within range. It can support up to 500 pounds. If
      it is overloaded, or if you move more than 100 feet away from it, the
      spell ends. You can end the spell as an action. While it is not carrying
      anything, you can use a bonus action to teleport the disk to an unoccupied
      space within range.</p><p>While you are within 20 feet of the disk, it is
      immobile. If you move more than 20 feet away, it tries to follow you,
      remaining 20 feet away. It can traverse stairs, slopes, and obstacles up
      to 3 feet high.</p><p>Additionally, you can ride the disc, spending your
      movement on your turn to move the disc up to 30 feet (following the
      movement rules above).</p><p>Moving the disk in this way is just as tiring
      as walking for the same amount of time.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When you use a 3rd-level spell slot, either the
      spell's duration increases to 8 hours or the disk's diameter is 10 feet,
      it can support up to 2, 000 pounds, and it can traverse obstacles up to 10
      feet high. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the disk's diameter is 20
      feet, it can support up to 16, 000 pounds, and it can traverse obstacles
      up to 20 feet high.</p>
