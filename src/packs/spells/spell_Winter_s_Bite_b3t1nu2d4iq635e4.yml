      <p dir="ltr">The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack during
      this spell&rsquo;s duration, your weapon encrusts with frost, and the
      attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to the target. The target must make
      a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, its speed is reduced by
      half for the remainder of this spell&rsquo;s duration, or until it
      succeeds on a Constitution saving throw made at the start of each of its
      turns.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Casting At Higher Levels:</strong> If you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
      increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
