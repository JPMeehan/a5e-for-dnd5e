      <p dir="ltr">As the material component burns, melts, or freezes and
      shatters in the palm of your hand, you turn your ire upon your target and
      the primordial energy rises up within you. You exhale dragon breath upon
      your targets.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You may choose to breathe out in a 20ft cone or a 30ft line.
      But you must also choose to either deal 3d6 damage, or use a special
      metallic breath weapon.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You may choose the damage type of this breath weapon from the
      following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison,
      radiant, or thunder. If you choose to deal damage, enemies in the area
      must make a dexterity save for half damage. This breath weapon is treated
      as true dragon breath for special effects or magical considerations.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">If you choose to use a special breath weapon, you may select
      from the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Brass:</strong> You breathe out
      sleep gas. This forces your targets to make a constitution save or fall
      into slumber for up to 1 minute. Loud noises, damage, or a creature
      spending their action can awaken the target.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Bronze:</strong> You breathe out
      a blast of ocean water. In addition to putting out nonmagical fires in the
      area, any creature hit must make a strength save or be knocked back 5ft
      and knocked prone.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Copper: </strong>You breathe out
      a cloud of slowing gas that creeps upon your enemies. Creatures in the
      area must make a constitution save or halve their movement rate for 3
      rounds and they must choose between an action or bonus action on their
      next turn, but not both.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Gold: </strong>You breathe out a
      weakening gas. Creatures in the area must make a constitution save or have
      disadvantage on weapon attacks for 3 rounds.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Silver:</strong> You breathe out
      an insidious paralytic vapor. Creatures in the area must make a
      constitution save or be stunned until the start of your next turn.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-cc791c8c-7fff-2c23-8eb6-9f22f4078e18">Cast at
      Higher Levels.</strong> When cast at a higher level you may deal an
      additional 1d8 damage per spell slot above 2nd. If cast at 6th level or
      higher, all creatures who witness the spell must make a charisma saving
      throw or be frightened for up to 1 minute, though they may continue making
      saving throws to end the frightened condition at the end of their
      subsequent turns. Creatures who have been exposed to dragon fear within
      the last 24 hours are immune to this frightening effect.</p>
