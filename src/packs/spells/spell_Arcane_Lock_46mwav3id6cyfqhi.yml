  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is sealed to all creatures except those you designate (who
      can open the object normally). Alternatively, you may choose a password
      that suppresses this spell for 1 minute when it is spoken within 5 feet of
      the target. The spell can also be suppressed for 10 minutes by casting
      <em>knock</em> on the target. Otherwise, the target cannot be opened
      normally and it is more difficult to break or force open, increasing the
      DC to break it or pick any locks on it by 10 (minimum DC
      20).</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Increase the
      DC to force open the object or pick any locks on the object by an
      additional 2 for each slot level above 2nd. Only a knock spell cast at a
      slot level equal to or greater than your arcane lock suppresses it.</p>
