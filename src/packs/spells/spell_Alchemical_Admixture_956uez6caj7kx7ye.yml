    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You fuse a pair of potions or alchemical items into a single
      whole that can function as either or both.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">When you cast this spell, choose two items from the following
      list: acid, adderwort roots, alchemist&rsquo;s fire, antitoxin, dried
      yewclaw bark, fairy cap, holy water, an ironwood acorn, laudanum, lavender
      paste, a paint pot, any potion, any poison, or pressed spiderbulb, (the
      narrator may include additional items at their discretion).</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The items must be different and one must not be a stronger
      version of the other (in other words, you can&rsquo;t combine two types of
      poison, even named ones, or two different strengths of healing potion) if
      you attempt an invalid item combination, both items are wasted and
      lost.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You also choose three command words. The two items disappear
      and fuse into a single softly-glowing liquid that appears in a
      standard-sized potion vial. As a bonus action, you can speak one of the
      command words, allowing you to choose one effect, the other, or both. For
      the next eight hours, the potion functions as the selected item or
      combination of items and may be used accordingly.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">If the two items are used differently (such as being thrown
      for alchemist&rsquo;s fire and swallowed for a healing potion) you cannot
      choose the &ldquo;both&rdquo; option.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">After the spell&rsquo;s duration ends, the combined item
      loses its potency and is treated as non-potable water.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this
      spell with a third-level spell or higher slot, you may choose the
      &ldquo;both&rdquo; option for items with different use cases. If you do,
      whenever you use the item, the effect of the other takes effect on any
      target affected by the first. For example, if you choose alchemist&rsquo;s
      fire and an ingested poison, the poison affects any target affected by the
      alchemist&rsquo;s fire and vice versa.</p>
