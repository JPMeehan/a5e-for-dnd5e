  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You stash a chest and its contents on the Ethereal Plane. To do so, you
      must touch the chest and its Tiny replica. The chest can hold up to 12
      cubic feet of nonliving matter. Food stored in the chest spoils after 1
      day.</p><p>While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, you can recall it to
      you at any point by using an action to touch the Tiny replica. The chest
      reappears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You
      can use an action at any time to return the chest to the Ethereal Plane so
      long as you are touching both the chest and its Tiny replica.</p><p>This
      effect ends if you cast the spell again on a different chest, if the
      replica is destroyed, or if you use an action to end the spell. After 60
      days without being recalled, there is a cumulative 5% chance per day that
      the spell effect will end. If for whatever reason the spell ends while the
      chest is still in the Ethereal Plane, the chest and all of its contents
      are lost.</p>
