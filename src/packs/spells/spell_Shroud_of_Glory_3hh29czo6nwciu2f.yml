      <p dir="ltr">You glow with brilliant divine light that obscures your
      features and dazzles your foes.</p><p dir="ltr">When you cast this spell,
      you begin glowing with brilliant light. Your head appears backlit no
      matter which angle you are viewed from. You shed bright light to a
      distance of 30 feet and dim light for an additional 30 feet. When a
      creature attacks you in melee, you may use your reaction to cause the
      light to flare, potentially blinding your attacker. The attacking creature
      must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC. If it fails, it
      is blinded until the end of its next turn and rolls the triggering attack
      with disadvantage. Once a creature has had this blinding effect used on
      it, you cannot use it on that same creature again with the same casting of
      Shroud of Glory.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, creatures that see you while
      this spell&rsquo;s effects are active have disadvantage on checks to
      remember anything about you except for the brilliant light or to recognize
      you later if they see you again. This second effect does not affect those
      who are very familiar with you such as close friends, traveling
      companions, longtime rivals, or immediate family members.</p>
