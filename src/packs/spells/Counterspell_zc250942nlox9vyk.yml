    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell.
      If the creature is casting a spell of 2nd-level or lower, its spell fails
      and has no effect.</p><p>If it is casting a spell of 3rd-level or higher,
      make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (DC 10 + the spell's
      level). On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect, but
      the creature can use its reaction to reshape the fraying magic and cast
      another spell with the same casting time as the original spell.</p><p>This
      new spell must be cast at a spell slot level equal to or less than half
      the original spell slot.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The interrupted spell has no effect if its level is
      less than the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, or if both
      spells use the same level spell slot an opposed spellcasting ability check
      is made.</p>
