      magically enhance the flavor of a dish, intensifying the herbs and spices
      to cover up the flavor of some additional ingredient. This addition could
      be poison, a potion&mdash;or the inclusion of vegetables. Any creature who
      consumes the food must make a Wisdom saving throw versus your spell save
      DC. On a success they may detect the added ingredient at the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, and if appropriate, turn hostile. Creatures
      who fail don&rsquo;t notice the presence of the added ingredient. If a
      poison or a potion was the added ingredient, the creature then makes any
      relevant saving throw and experiences the effect of the item as
      normal.</span></p>
