  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, a mystical bond connects the target and the
      precious stone used to cast this spell.</p><p>Any time after, you may
      crush the stone and speak the name of the item, summoning it instantly
      into your hand no matter the physical, metaphysical, or planar distances
      involved, at which point the spell ends. If another creature is holding
      the item when the stone is crushed, the item is not summoned to you.
      Instead, the spell grants you the knowledge of who possesses it and a
      general idea of the creature's location.</p><p>Each time you cast this
      spell, you must use a different precious stone.</p><p>Dispel magic or a
      similar effect targeting the stone ends the spell.</p>
