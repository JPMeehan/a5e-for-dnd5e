      <p dir="ltr">With snapping fingers, a song, and a few dance moves, you
      trigger a musical number. Music in a style of your choosing plays from an
      invisible source around you, and creatures within 20ft feel the need to
      join the dance routine and to sing along with the song, occasionally
      taking on brief communicative solos in the piece.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Creatures in the area may attempt a charisma save at the
      start of their turn to avoid being afflicted. If a creature has succeeded
      on the save, you may spend your action to try and draw them into the song
      on your turn, forcing an additional charisma save. The 20ft radius area
      remains centered on your square.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Affected creatures lose half their movement speed and cannot
      take a bonus action. All speech and spellcasting inside the area becomes
      song lyrics, which grants disadvantage to any attempt to identify a spell
      being cast in the area or counter a spell cast by a singer.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">A number of creatures up to your charisma modifier may choose
      to intentionally fail the saving throw. These creatures still lose half of
      their movement to dance, but can take bonus actions normally and gain
      advantage on attacks against creatures that have failed their saving
      throw.</p>
