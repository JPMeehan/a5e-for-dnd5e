      <p dir="ltr">As you shout the edict at your targets, vines, ropes, or
      chains of radiant gold or nebulous shadow rise up to bind your targets and
      hold them fast. Starting with the target with the lowest hit points
      (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets are grappled by these bindings,
      and make a Charisma save at the end of their turn to end the grappled
      state. In addition, as an action, they may make a charisma saving throw to
      attempt to break the grapple to break the bindings.</p><p dir="ltr">As
      each target is grappled, subtract its hit points from the total before
      moving on to the next target. A target&rsquo;s hit points must be equal to
      or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any effect.</p><p
      dir="ltr">If the spell grapples no creatures, the creature in the area
      with the lowest hit point total is rattled until the beginning of its next
      turn.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-c4fdc523-7fff-4cdc-dd69-e3e1c67f00f7">Cast at
      Higher Levels. </strong>The spell affects an additional 2d10 hit points
      worth of creatures for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
