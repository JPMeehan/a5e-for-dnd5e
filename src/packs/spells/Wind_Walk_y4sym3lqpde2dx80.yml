  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The targets assume a gaseous form and appear as wisps of cloud. Each
      target has a flying speed of 300 feet and resistance to damage from
      nonmagical weapons, but the only action it can take is the Dash action or
      to revert to its normal form (a process that takes 1 minute during which
      it is incapacitated and can't move).</p><p>Until the spell ends, a target
      can change again to cloud form (in an identical transformation
      process).</p><p>When the effect ends for a target flying in cloud form, it
      descends 60 feet each round for up to 1 minute or until it safely lands.
      If the target can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the rest of
      the way normally.</p>
