  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em><strong>Target:&nbsp;</strong>Huge or smaller beast or plant with
      Intelligence 3 or less</em></p>

      <p>You impart sentience in the target, granting it an Intelligence of 10
      and proficiency in a language you know. A plant targeted by this spell
      gains the ability to move, as well as senses identical to those of a
      human. The Narrator assigns awakened plant statistics (such as an awakened
      shrub or awakened tree).</p>

      <p>The target is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your
      companions harm it. Depending on how you treated the target while it was
      charmed, when the condition ends the awakened creature may choose to
      remain friendly to you.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Target an additional
      creature for each slot level above 5th. Each target requires its own
      material component.</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <p><strong>Rare: Augmented Awaken.</strong> When cast at higher levels,
      add 30 days to the charm effect of this spell for every 2 slot levels
      above 5th.</p>
