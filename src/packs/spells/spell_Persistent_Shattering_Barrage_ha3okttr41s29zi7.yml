    value: >-
      <p>You create three orbs of jagged broken glass and hurl them at targets
      within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.</p>

      <p>Make a ranged spell attack for each orb. On a hit, the target takes 2d4
      slashing damage and the shards of broken glass remain suspended in midair,
      filling the area they occupy (or 5 feet of the space they occupy if the
      creature is Large-sized or larger) with shards of suspended broken glass.
      Whenever a creature enters an area of broken glass for the first time or
      starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
      2d4 slashing damage.&nbsp;The shards of broken glass dissolve into
      harmless wisps of sand and blow away after 1 minute.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You create one
      additional orb for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Persistent Shattering
      Barrage.&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;shards of broken glass do not dissolve
      harmlessly&nbsp;and instead fall, turning the area they occupy
      into&nbsp;difficult terrain.</p>
