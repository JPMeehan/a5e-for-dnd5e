    value: >-
      <p>On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until
      the spell ends, you can probe a creature's mind to read its thoughts by
      focusing on one creature you can see within range. The creature makes a
      Wisdom saving throw. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or less or
      that don't speak any languages are unaffected. On a failed save, you learn
      the creature's surface thoughts &mdash;what is most on its mind in that
      moment. On a successful save, you fail to read the creature's thoughts and
      can't attempt to probe its mind for the duration. Conversation naturally
      shapes the course of a creature's thoughts and what it is thinking about
      may change based on questions verbally directed at it.</p><p>Once you have
      read a creature's surface thoughts, you can use an action to probe deeper
      into its mind. The creature makes a second Wisdom saving throw. On a
      successful save, you fail to read the creature's deeper thoughts and the
      spell ends. On a failure, you gain insight into the creature's
      motivations, emotional state, and something that looms large in its
      mind.</p><p>The creature then becomes aware you are probing its mind and
      can use an action to make an Intelligence check contested by your
      Intelligence check, ending the spell if it succeeds.</p><p>Additionally,
      you can use an action to scan for thinking creatures within range that you
      can't see.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a thinking creature, so
      long as it remains within range you can attempt to read its thoughts as
      described above (even if you can't see it).</p><p>The spell penetrates
      most barriers but is blocked by 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of common metal,
      or a thin sheet of lead.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When using a 5th-level spell slot, increase the
      spell's range to 1 mile. When using a 7th-level spell slot, increase the
      range to 10 miles.</p><p>When using a 9th-level spell slot, increase the
      range to 1, 000 miles.</p>
