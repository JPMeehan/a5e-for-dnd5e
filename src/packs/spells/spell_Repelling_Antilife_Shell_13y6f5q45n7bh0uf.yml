  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A barrier that glimmers with an oily rainbow hue pops into existence
      around you. The barrier moves with you and prevents creatures other than
      undead and constructs from passing or reaching through its
      surface.</p><p>The barrier does not prevent spells or attacks with ranged
      or reach weapons from passing through the barrier.</p><p>The spell ends if
      you move so that a Tiny or larger living creature is forced to pass
      through the barrier.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare:
      Repelling Antilife Shell.</strong> When the spell would force a living
      creature to pass through the barrier, that creature is harmlessly pushed
      back into a space of its choosing outside of the sphere and within 5 feet
      of its original position. </p>
