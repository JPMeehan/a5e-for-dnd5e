  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Willing targets are transported to a plane of existence that you
      choose. If the destination is generally described, targets arrive near
      that destination in a location chosen by the Narrator. If you know the
      correct sequence of an existing teleportation circle (see teleportation
      circle), you can choose it as the destination (when the designated circle
      is too small for all targets to fit, any additional targets are shunted to
      the closest unoccupied spaces).</p><p>Alternatively this spell can be used
      offensively to banish an unwilling target. You make a melee spell attack
      and on a hit the target makes a Charisma saving throw or is transported to
      a random location on a plane of existence that you choose. Once
      transported, you must spend 1 minute concentrating on this spell or the
      target returns to the last space it occupied (otherwise it must find its
      own way back).</p>
