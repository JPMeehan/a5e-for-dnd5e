      <p dir="ltr">You conjure up a ball of densely-packed, rock-filled mud and
      sling it at a point within range. The mud explodes, doing 4d4 points of
      bludgeoning damage, extinguishing unattended non-magical fires, and
      creating an area of difficult terrain that persists for one minute.
      Creatures in the area that fail their save are also blinded until the end
      of their next turn.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast At Higher
      Levels.</strong> The damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above
      2nd. In addition, if the spell is cast with a 4th-level or higher slot,
      the area increases to 20 feet.</p>
