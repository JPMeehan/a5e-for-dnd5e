      <p dir="ltr">You place a literal mark of shame upon a creature, indicating
      to all who see it that the creature has been condemned for some breach of
      character or law. When you cast this spell, you may choose to mark the
      affected creature for as little as an hour or up to a week.</p><p
      dir="ltr">An affected that fails its save suffers a -2 penalty to its
      effective Prestige score and a 1d4 penalty to any Persuasion or Deception
      checks it makes while the mark remains. It also suffers disadvantage on
      stealth checks and cannot benefit from invisibility, as the mark is
      clearly visible wherever it goes.</p><p dir="ltr">A creature that succeeds
      on its save instead suffers 2d8 points of psychic damage and is stunned
      until the beginning of its next turn. A creature may willingly fail its
      save, accepting the mark and avoiding the damage.</p><p dir="ltr">This
      spell&rsquo;s effects can be ended early by casting remove curse or
      similar magic on the target.</p>
