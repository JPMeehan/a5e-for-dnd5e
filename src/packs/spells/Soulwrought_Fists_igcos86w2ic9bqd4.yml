  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target's hands harden with inner power, turning dexterous fingers
      into magical iron cudgels.</p><p>Until the spell ends, the target drops
      anything it is holding and cannot use its hands to grasp objects or
      perform complex tasks. A target can still cast any spell that does not
      specifically require its hands.</p><p>When making unarmed strikes, the
      target can use its spellcasting ability or Dexterity (its choice) instead
      of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In
      addition, the target's unarmed strikes deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and
      count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
      nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
