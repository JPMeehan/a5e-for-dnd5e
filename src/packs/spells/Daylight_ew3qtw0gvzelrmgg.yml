    value: >-
      <p>Magical light fills the area. The area is brightly lit and sheds dim
      light for an additional 60 feet. If any of the area overlaps with magical
      darkness created by a spell of 3rd-level or lower, the spell that created
      the darkness is dispelled.</p><p>When cast on an object that is in your
      possession or unattended, the light shines from it and moves with it.
      Completely covering the object with something that is not transparent
      blocks the light.</p>
