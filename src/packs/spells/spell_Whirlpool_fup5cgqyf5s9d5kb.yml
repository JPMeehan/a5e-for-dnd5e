    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a swirling flood of water. The water must be on the ground
      or in a body of water; if it is on the ground, it is collected in a
      5-foot-deep pool. The area is difficult terrain, and any target that
      enters the area or starts its turn there must make a Strength saving
      throw, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage and getting pulled 10 feet toward the
      center, taking half damage and not being pulled on a success.</p><p>Boats
      can be pulled along by the current, and use the pilot&rsquo;s vehicle tool
      checks to resist the movement; boats do not take the
      damage.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> The area increases
      by 10 feet and the damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level above
      5th.</p>
