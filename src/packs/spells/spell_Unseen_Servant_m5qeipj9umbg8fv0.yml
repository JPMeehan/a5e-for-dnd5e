  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an invisible, mindless, shapeless force to perform simple
      tasks. The servant appears in an unoccupied space on the ground that you
      can see and endures until it takes damage, moves more than 60 feet away
      from you, or the spell ends. It has AC 10, a Strength of 2, and it can't
      attack.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to mentally command it to move up
      to 15 feet and interact with an object.</p><p>The servant can do anything
      a humanoid servant can do &mdash;fetching things, cleaning, mending,
      folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, pouring wine, and so on.
      Once given a command the servant performs the task to the best of its
      ability until the task is completed, then waits for its next
      command.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You create
      an additional servant for each slot level above 1st.</p>
