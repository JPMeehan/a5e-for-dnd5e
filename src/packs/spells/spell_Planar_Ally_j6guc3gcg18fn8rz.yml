  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An entity from beyond the realm material answers your call for
      assistance. You must know this entity whether it is holy, unholy, or
      beyond the bounds of mortal comprehension. The entity sends forth a
      servant loyal to it to aid you in your endeavors. If you have a specific
      servant in mind you may speak its name during the casting, but ultimately
      who is sent to answer your call is the entity's decision.</p><p>The
      creature that appears (a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend), is under no
      compulsion to behave in any particular way other than how its nature and
      personality direct it. Any request made of the creature, simple or
      complex, requires an equal amount of payment which you must bargain with
      the creature to ascertain. The creature can request either items,
      sacrifices, or services in exchange for its assistance. A creature that
      you cannot communicate with cannot be bargained with.</p><p>A task that
      can be completed in minutes is worth 100 gold per minute, a task that
      requires hours is worth 1, 000 gold per hour, and a task requiring days is
      worth 10, 000 gold per day (the creature can only accept tasks contained
      within a 10 day timeframe). A creature can often be persuaded to lower or
      raise prices depending on how a task aligns with its personality and the
      goals of its master &mdash;some require no payment at all if the task is
      deemed worthy. Additionally, a task that poses little or no risk only
      requires half the usual amount of payment, and an extremely dangerous task
      might call for double the usual payment. Still, only extreme circumstances
      will cause a creature summoned this way to accept tasks with a near
      certain result of death.</p><p>A creature returns to its place of origin
      when a task is completed or if you fail to negotiate an agreeable task and
      payment. Should a creature join your party, it counts as a member of the
      group and receives a full portion of any experience gained.</p>
