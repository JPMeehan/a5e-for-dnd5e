  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates a pact which is enforced by celestial or fiendish
      forces. You and another willing creature commit to a mutual agreement,
      clearly declaring your parts of the agreement during the
      casting.</p><p>Until the spell ends, if for any reason either participant
      breaks the agreement or fails to uphold their part of the bargain, beings
      of celestial or fiendish origin appear within unoccupied spaces as close
      as possible to the participant who broke the bargain. The beings are
      hostile to the deal-breaking participant and attempt to kill them, as well
      as any creatures that defend them. When the dealbreaking participant is
      killed, or the spell's duration ends, the beings disappear in a flash of
      smoke.</p><p>The spellcaster chooses whether the beings are celestial or
      fiendish while casting the spell, and the Narrator chooses the exact
      creatures summoned (such as a couatl or 5 imps). There may be any number
      of beings, but their combined Challenge Rating can't exceed
      5.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The combined
      Challenge Rating of summoned beings increases by 2 and the duration
      increases by 13 days for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
