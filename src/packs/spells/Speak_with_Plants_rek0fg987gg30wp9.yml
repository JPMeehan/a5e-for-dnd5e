  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your voice takes on a magical timbre, awakening the targets to limited
      sentience. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate with you and
      follow simple commands, telling you about recent events including
      creatures that have passed, weather, and nearby locations.</p><p>The
      targets have a limited mobility: they can move their branches, tendrils,
      and stalks freely. This allows them to turn ordinary terrain into
      difficult terrain, or make difficult terrain caused by vegetation into
      ordinary terrain for the duration as vines and branches move at your
      request. This spell can also release a creature restrained by an entangle
      spell.</p><p>At the Narrator's discretion the targets may be able to
      perform other tasks, though each must remain rooted in place. If a plant
      creature is in the area, you can communicate with it but it is not
      compelled to follow your requests.</p>
