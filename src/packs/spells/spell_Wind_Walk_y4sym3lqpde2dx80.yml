      <p>Each target has a flying speed of 300 feet and resistance to damage
      from nonmagical weapons, but the only action it can take is the Dash
      action or to revert to its normal form (a process that takes 1 minute
      during which it is incapacitated and can't move).</p><p>Until the spell
      ends, a target can change again to cloud form (in an identical
      transformation process).</p><p>When the effect ends for a target flying in
      cloud form, it descends 60 feet each round for up to 1 minute or until it
      safely lands. If the target can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls
      the rest of the way normally.</p>
