    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">With a hand going to your upper chest and a brief rebuke you
      cause your target consternation, and force them to reword themself.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">As a reaction to your target making a successful social
      maneuver you create the brief illusion that they have said something
      scandalous, scurrilous, or otherwise unfit for polite or mixed company. On
      a failed saving throw the target&rsquo;s successful skill or ability check
      is instead treated as a failure.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">A creature that witnesses you using this spell can roll an
      insight check against your passive Deception to recognize that a spell has
      been cast.</p>
