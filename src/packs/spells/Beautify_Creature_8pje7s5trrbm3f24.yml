      <p>The creature is immediately and beautifully groomed, as if it had been
      lovingly attended to by a group of no less than 4 highly-skilled servants.
      Its clothing (if it has any) will be spotlessly clean with any minor
      damage mended and, at the creature&rsquo;s option, it may also be
      festooned with ribbons, be perfumed, and have makeup, face paint, or body
      paint applied. If the creature desires, its hair, beard, fur, and/or
      feathers can be styled or cut by this spell. This spell can only provide
      the most basic of accessories, such as ribbons, simple hair pins, and the
      like, which disappear in 8 hours.</p>

      <p>The creature gains an expertise die on all non-combat related Charisma
      (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks for the next 8 hours. The
      Narrator may declare this effect ends early if the creature is in a
      grueling fight, caught in severe weather, or endures any other that may
      compromise the grooming.</p>

      <p>A truly unwilling creature can resist the spell, but few do; the
      experience is very pleasant and tailored to the target&rsquo;s wishes and
      aesthetics, not the caster&rsquo;s.</p>
