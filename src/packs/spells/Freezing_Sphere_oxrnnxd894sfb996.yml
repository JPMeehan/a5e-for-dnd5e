  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A freezing globe streaks to a point within range and explodes, dealing
      10d6 cold damage to creatures in the area. Liquid in the area is frozen to
      a depth of 6 inches for 1 minute. Any creature caught in the ice can use
      an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to
      escape.</p><p>Instead of firing the globe, you can hold it in your hand.
      If you handle it carefully, it won't explode until a minute after you cast
      the spell. At any time, you or another creature can strike the globe,
      throw it up to 60 feet, or use it as a slingstone, causing it to explode
      on impact.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
