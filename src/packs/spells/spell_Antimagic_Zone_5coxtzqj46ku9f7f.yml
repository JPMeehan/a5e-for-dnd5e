    value: >-
      <p>A permanent, immovable zone of antimagic fills the area, suppressing
      all magical effects within it. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion,
      sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the
      zone&rsquo;s effects. The zone is dispelled only if more than 10 percent
      of its area overlaps with that of another antimagic zone spell (which is
      also dispelled).</p><p><strong><em>Area Suppression</em></strong>: When a
      magical effect protrudes into the zone, that part of the effect&rsquo;s
      area is suppressed. For example, the ice created by a wall of ice is
      suppressed within the zone, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is
      large enough.</p><p><em><strong>Creatures and Objects</strong></em>: While
      within the zone, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic
      temporarily wink out of existence, reappearing immediately once the space
      they occupied is no longer within the zone.</p><p><strong><em>Dispel
      Magic</em></strong>: The sphere is immune to dispel magic and similar
      magical effects, including antimagic field spells.</p><p><strong><em>Magic
      Items</em></strong>: While within the zone, magic items function as if
      they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be
      suppressed when they fully leave the zone.</p><p><strong><em>Magical
      Travel</em></strong>: Whether the zone includes a destination or departure
      point, any planar travel or teleportation within it automatically fails.
      Until the spell ends or the zone moves, magical portals and
      extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a bag of holding ) within
      the zone are closed.</p><p><em><strong>Spells</strong></em>: Any spell
      cast within the zone or at a target within the zone is suppressed and the
      spell slot is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also
      suppressed within the zone. If a spell or magical effect has a duration,
      time spent suppressed counts against it.</p>
