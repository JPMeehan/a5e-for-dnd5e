      <p dir="ltr">You ward an area allowing you to stand guard over your
      companions who sleep secure beneath your protection.</p><p dir="ltr">While
      the spell is active, as long as you remain within the spell&rsquo;s area,
      you gain darkvision with a range of 300 feet and make all Perception
      checks with advantage. You do not suffer the effects of a missed rest and
      are able to stay alert and vigilant for the entire night. You recover
      spell slots normally, but do not gain the other benefits of a rest such as
      restoring hit points, hit dice, or other resources such as those provided
      by your class, archetype, heritage, and/or feats. You may magically wake
      any number of creatures sleeping within the spell&rsquo;s area as a bonus
      action.</p><p>Invisible creatures that approach the salt line that defines
      the edge of the area become quasi-visible (treat as lightly obscured) when
      they are 10 feet away and become fully visible and outlined in a faerie
      fire effect that persists for one minute if they cross the line. Creatures
      on the ethereal plane cannot cross into the spell&rsquo;s
      area.</p><p>Friendly creatures sleeping in the area gain the effects of a
      long rest in a sanctuary if they finish a long rest there.</p>
