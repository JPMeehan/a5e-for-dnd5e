  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You assume the form of a creature of a Challenge Rating equal to or
      lower than your level. The creature cannot be an undead or a construct,
      and it must be a creature you have seen. You change into the average
      version of that creature, and do not gain any class levels or the
      Spellcasting trait.</p><p>Until the spell ends or you are dropped to 0 hit
      points, your game statistics (including your hit points) are replaced by
      the statistics of the chosen creature, though you keep your Charisma,
      Intelligence, and Wisdom scores. You also keep your skill and saving throw
      proficiencies as well as gaining the creature's. However, if you share a
      proficiency with the creature, and the creature's bonus is higher than
      yours, you use the creature's bonus. You keep all of your features,
      skills, and traits gained from your class, heritage, culture, background,
      or other sources, and can use them as long as the creature is physically
      capable of doing so. You do not keep any special senses, such as
      darkvision, unless the creature also has them. You can only speak if the
      creature is typically capable of speech. You cannot use legendary actions
      or lair actions. Your gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges
      with your form has no effect until you leave the form.</p><p>When you
      revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had
      before you transformed. If the spell's effect on you ends early from
      dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal
      form and knocks you unconscious if the damage reduces you to 0 hit
      points.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you can use an action to change into
      another form of your choice. The new form follows all the rules as the
      previous form, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points
      than your previous form, your hit points remain at their previous
      value.</p>
