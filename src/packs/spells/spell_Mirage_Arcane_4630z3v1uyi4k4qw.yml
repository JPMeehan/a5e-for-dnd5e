  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You make terrain within the spell's area appear as another kind of
      terrain, tricking all senses (including touch).&nbsp;The general shape of
      the terrain remains the same, however. A small town could resemble a
      woodland, a smooth road could appear rocky and overgrown, a deep pit could
      resemble a shallow pond, and so on.</p>

      <p>Structures may be altered in the similar way, or added where there are
      none. Creatures are not disguised, concealed, or added by the spell.</p>

      <p>The illusion appears completely real in all aspects, including physical
      terrain, and can be physically interacted with. Clear terrain becomes
      difficult terrain, and vice versa. Any part of the illusory terrain such
      as a boulder, or water collected from an illusory stream, disappears
      immediately upon leaving the spell's area.</p>

      <p>Creatures with truesight see through the illusion, but are not immune
      to its effects. They may know that the overgrown path is in fact a well
      maintained road, but are still impeded by illusory rocks and branches.</p>
