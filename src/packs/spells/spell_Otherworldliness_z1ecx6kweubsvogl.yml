      <p dir="ltr">You call upon the strange power you have harnessed to produce
      a variety of useful effects. Choose one:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">An eye with an appearance
      of your choosing opens on your body. You can see through the eye, and if
      it is in a useful place (such as the back of your head or on a hand you
      can use to look around corners with) it may, at the Narrator&rsquo;s
      discretion, give you an Expertise die on Perception checks. It closes and
      disappears when the spell ends.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p
      dir="ltr" role="presentation">Darkness or magical energy swirls around
      your feet. While the spell lasts, you are lightly obscured.</p></li><li
      dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Spectral insects
      of a type of your choosing flutter, buzz, or crawl around your space and
      body.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">Your touch causes things you touch to lose some of
      their essence - colors bleach, food becomes less flavorful, light becomes
      pale rather than warm. Whatever you touch returns to normal when the spell
      ends.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You emit a high-pitched sound in a 20-foot sphere
      around yourself that most creatures can&rsquo;t consciously perceive, but
      find irritating just the same. Checks to maintain concentration are made
      with a -1d4 penalty while this effect is active. Some creatures may also
      decide to be somewhere else, finding you too annoying to hang
      around.</p></li></ul>
