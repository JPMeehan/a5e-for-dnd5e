  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A blast of dazzling multicolored light flashes from your hand to blind
      your targets until the start of your next turn. Starting with the target
      with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets
      within the area are blinded, in ascending order according to their hit
      points.</p><p>When a target is blinded, subtract its hit points from the
      total before moving on to the next target.</p><p>A target's hit points
      must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have
      any affect.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Add an
      additional 2d10 hit points for each slot level above 1st.</p>
