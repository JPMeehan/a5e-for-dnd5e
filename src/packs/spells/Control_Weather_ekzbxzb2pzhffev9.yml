    value: >-
      <p>You must be outdoors to cast this spell, and it ends early if you don't
      have a clear path to the sky.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you change the
      weather conditions in the area from what is normal for the current climate
      and season. Choose to increase or decrease each weather condition
      (precipitation, temperature, and wind) up or down by one stage on the
      following tables. Whenever you change the wind, you can also change its
      direction. The new conditions take effect after 1d4 &times; 10 minutes, at
      which point you can change the conditions again. The weather gradually
      returns to normal when the spell ends.</p>
