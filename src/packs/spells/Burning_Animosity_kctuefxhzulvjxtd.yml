      <p><strong>Target:</strong> 1 creature that is affected by your Studied
      Adversary feature</p>

      <p>You zero in on one particularly despised enemy. When you cast this
      spell, the target takes 2d6 points of fire or radiant damage (your choice)
      and must make a Wisdom save against your spell save DC. A target that
      fails its save is marked with a visible, glowing brand or sigil of your
      choice on a prominent part of its body (usually the forehead). The mark
      sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light in a 15-foot radius.
      While the mark persists, your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d4 fire
      or radiant damage (same as the initial damage) to the target, and it
      cannot benefit from invisibility or Stealth.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> For each slot level above 1st,
      you may either select an additional target or you may increase the bonus
      damage against the target by 1d4. This is an either-or proposition and may
      not be mixed and matched.</p>
