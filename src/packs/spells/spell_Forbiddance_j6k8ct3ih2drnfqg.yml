      <p><span class="fontstyle0"><strong>Target:</strong> </span><span
      class="fontstyle2">Area up to 40,000 square feet and&nbsp;up to 30 feet
      tall.</span></p>

      <p>You protect the target area against magical travel. Creatures can't
      teleport into the area, use a magical portal to enter it, or travel into
      it from another plane of existence, such as the Astral or Ethereal Plane.
      The spell's area can't overlap with another&nbsp;<em>forbiddance</em>
      spell.</p>

      <p>The spell damages specific types of trespassing creatures. Choose one
      or more of celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen
      creature first enters the area on a turn or starts its turn there, it
      takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the
      spell). You may designate a password. A creature speaking this password as
      it enters takes no damage from the spell.</p>

      <p>After casting this spell on the same area for 30 consecutive days it
      becomes permanent until dispelled. This final casting to make the spell
      permanent consumes its material components.</p>
