  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You quietly play a tragedy, a song that fills those around you with
      magical sorrow. Each creature in the area makes a Charisma saving throw at
      the start of its turn. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 psychic
      damage, it spends its action that turn crying, and it can't take reactions
      until the start of its next turn. Creatures that are immune to the charmed
      condition automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p><p>If a creature
      other than you hears the entire song (remaining within the spell's area
      from the casting through the duration) it is so wracked with sadness that
      it is stunned for 1d4 rounds.</p><p>You cannot cast another spell through
      your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this
      spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage
      increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
