      <p dir="ltr">You whip your shield around to protect yourself, bolstering
      it with magic as you do.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You may cast this spell whenever you are targeted by an
      attack or whenever you are targeted with a hostile spell or ability that
      would deal damage to you. If your shield is not already equipped, this
      spell equips it as part of the casting (potentially raising your AC and
      canceling the attack). If you are holding something that would prevent you
      from equipping your shield, you drop it at your feet as part of the
      casting of this spell. In addition, you gain resistance to any damage done
      by the triggering attack or effect and gain an expertise die on any saving
      throws it imposes. This spell provides no protection against an effect
      with an area such as a dragon&rsquo;s breath or a fireball spell.</p>
