    value: >-
      <p>When the object is opened by someone other than you, a fiery
      5-foot-radius explosion fills the area around the object, dealing 4d10
      fire damage. When you cast this spell, choose a point on the object for
      the explosion to originate from. You can choose to set a password to
      bypass the trap, and you can choose whether or not the object and contents
      of the object take the damage as well.</p>

      <p>Detecting the trap and disabling the trap rolls checks against your
      spell DC.</p>

      <p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> Increase the fire damage dealt
      by 1d10 for every slot level above 4th.</p>
