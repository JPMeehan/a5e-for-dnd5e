    value: >-
      <p>You move the target with the power of your mind.</p>

      <p>Until the spell ends you can use an action on subsequent turns to pick
      a new target or continue to affect the same target. Depending on whether
      you target a creature or an object, the spell has the following
      effects:</p>

      <p><strong>Creature. </strong>The target makes a Strength check against
      your spell save DC or it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and
      restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot
      move a target beyond the range of the spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Object.</strong>&nbsp;You move the target 30 feet in any
      direction. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature
      can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If the target fails,
      you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet
      in any direction, but not beyond the range of the spell.</p>

      <p>You can use telekinesis to finely manipulate objects as though you were
      using them yourself&mdash;you can open doors and unscrew lids, dip a quill
      in ink and make it write, and so on.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using an
      8th-level spell slot, this spell does not require your concentration.</p>
