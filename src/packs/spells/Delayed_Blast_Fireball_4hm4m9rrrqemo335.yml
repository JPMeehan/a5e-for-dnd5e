  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A glowing bead of yellow light flies from your finger and lingers at a
      point at the center of the area until you end the spell&mdash;either
      because your concentration is broken or because you choose to end
      it&mdash;and the bead detonates. Each creature in the area takes 12d6 fire
      damage. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the
      damage increases by 1d6.</p><p>If touched before the spell ends, the
      creature touching the bead makes a Dexterity saving throw or the bead
      detonates. On a successful save, the creature can use an action to throw
      the bead up to 40 feet, moving the area with it. If the bead strikes a
      creature or solid object, the bead detonates.</p><p>The fire spreads
      around corners, and it damages and ignites any flammable unattended
      objects in the area.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
      above 7th.</p>
