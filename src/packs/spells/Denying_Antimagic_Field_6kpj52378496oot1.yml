  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An invisible sphere of antimagic forms around you, moving with you and
      suppressing all magical effects within it. At the Narrator's discretion,
      sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the
      sphere's effects.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Area Suppression:</strong> When a
      magical effect protrudes into the sphere, that part of the effect's area
      is suppressed. For example, the ice created by a wall of ice is suppressed
      within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large
      enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creatures and Objects:</strong> While
      within the sphere, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic
      temporarily wink out of existence, reappearing immediately once the space
      they occupied is no longer within the
      sphere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dispel Magic:</strong> The sphere is immune
      to dispel magic and similar magical effects, including other antimagic
      field spells.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magic Items:</strong> While within
      the sphere, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic
      weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the
      sphere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magical Travel:</strong> Whether the sphere
      includes a destination or departure point, any planar travel or
      teleportation within it automatically fails. Until the spell ends or the
      sphere moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that
      created by a bag of holding) within the sphere are
      closed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spells:</strong> Any spell cast within the
      sphere or at a target within the sphere is suppressed and the spell slot
      is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within
      the sphere. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent
      suppressed counts against it.</p></li></ul><hr class="a5e-rule
