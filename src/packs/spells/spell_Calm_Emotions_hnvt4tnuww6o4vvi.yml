  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Strong and harmful emotions are suppressed within the area. You can
      choose which of the following two effects to apply to each target of this
      spell.</p><ul><li><p>Suppress the charmed or frightened conditions, though
      they resume when the spell ends (time spent suppressed counts against a
      condition's duration).</p></li><li><p>Suppress hostile feelings towards
      creatures of your choice until the spell ends. This suppression ends if a
      target is attacked or sees its allies being attacked. Targets act normally
      when the spell ends.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The spell area increases by 10 feet for each slot
      level above 2nd.</p>
