    value: >-
      <p>You wrench open a hole in reality and summon a creature from the cracks
      between the planes. This creature uses the statistics of a conjured
      aberration. In addition, roll 1d4 or choose the aberration&rsquo;s general
      appearance.</p><ol><li>Squid-like</li><li>Writhing ball of body
      parts</li><li>Humanoid with featureless face</li><li>Translucent
      worm</li></ol><p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and
      takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands.
      Without such commands, the creature only defends itself. The creature
      disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken
      before the spell ends, you lose control of the aberration, which becomes
      hostile and attacks you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature
      disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p><p><em><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels</strong></em>. For each slot level above 5th, the
      aberration&rsquo;s AC increases by 1, its hit points increase by 10, and
      when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra
      damage.</p><hr><p><strong>Rare: </strong><strong>Vornift&rsquo;s Ecstatic
      Conjure Aberration</strong>. The conjured aberration has an additional 20
      hit points and its attacks deal an additional 2d4 damage. However, when
      you first conjure it, you must immediately succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
      saving throw or lose control of the aberration.</p>
