  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target object's weight is greatly increased. Any creature holding
      the object must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop it. A creature
      which doesn't drop the object has disadvantage on attack rolls until the
      start of your next turn as it figures out the object's new
      balance.</p><p>Creatures that attempt to push, drag, or lift the object
      must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC to do so.</p>
