  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A bolt of lightning arcs out from you in a direction you choose. Each
      creature in the area takes 8d6 lightning damage. The lightning ignites
      flammable objects in its path that aren't worn or carried by another
      creature.</p><p>If the spell is stopped by an object at least as large as
      its width, it ends there unless it deals enough damage to break through.
      When it does, it continues to the end of its area.</p><p><strong><em>Cast
      at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Damage increases by 1d6 for every slot
      level above 3rd.</p>
