  description:
    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You mold clay or other materials into a rough approximation
      of your target, wrapping it in cloth to mimic clothes or armor, and even
      use straw, needles, or lint to create a facsimile of hair. This doll is
      then imbued with a spark of your malevolence.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The likeness of the target creature does not provide any
      function of its own, save as a rough approximation of a person or
      creature. Showing it to someone while asking about the target gives
      advantage on checks made to identify or locate someone through social
      means</p>
