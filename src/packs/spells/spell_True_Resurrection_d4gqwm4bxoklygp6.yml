    value: >-
      <p>Provided the target's soul is willing and able to return to its body,
      it returns to life with all of its hit points.</p><p>The spell cures any
      poisons and diseases that affected the target at the time of death, closes
      all mortal wounds, and restores any missing body parts.</p><p>If no body
      (or body parts) exist, you can still cast the spell but must speak the
      creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you
      choose within 10 feet of you. This option requires diamonds worth at least
      50, 000 gold (consumed by the spell).</p>
