  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear in your space. For the
      duration, these copies move with you and mimic your actions, creating
      confusion as to which is real.</p><p>You can use an action to dismiss
      them.</p><p>Each time you're targeted by a creature's attack, roll a d20
      to see if it targets you or one of your copies.</p><p>With 3 copies, a
      roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted. With two copies, a roll of 8
      or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets
      the copy.</p><p>A copy's AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and when it
      is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed.</p><p>It may be destroyed only by
      an attack that hits it.</p><p>All other damage and effects have no
      impact.</p><p>Attacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have
      blindsight, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this
      spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a
      5th-level spell slot, the duration increases to concentration (1
      hour).</p>
