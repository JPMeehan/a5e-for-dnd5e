  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An entity from beyond the realm material answers your call for
      assistance. You must know this entity whether it is holy, unholy, or
      beyond the bounds of mortal comprehension. The entity sends forth a
      servant loyal to it to aid you in your endeavors. If you have a specific
      servant in mind you may speak its name during the casting, but ultimately
      who is sent to answer your call is the entity's decision.</p>

      <p>The creature that appears (a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend), is
      under no compulsion to behave in any particular way other than how its
      nature and personality direct it. Any request made of the creature, simple
      or complex, requires an equal amount of payment which you must bargain
      with the creature to ascertain. The creature can request either items,
      sacrifices, or services in exchange for its assistance. A creature that
      you cannot communicate with cannot be bargained with.</p>

      <p>A task that can be completed in minutes is worth 100 gold per minute, a
      task that requires hours is worth 1, 000 gold per hour, and a task
      requiring days is worth 10, 000 gold per day (the creature can only accept
      tasks contained within a 10 day timeframe). A creature can often be
      persuaded to lower or raise prices depending on how a task aligns with its
      personality and the goals of its master &mdash;some require no payment at
      all if the task is deemed worthy. Additionally, a task that poses little
      or no risk only requires half the usual amount of payment, and an
      extremely dangerous task might call for double the usual payment. Still,
      only extreme circumstances will cause a creature summoned this way to
      accept tasks with a near certain result of death.</p>

      <p>A creature returns to its place of origin when a task is completed or
      if you fail to negotiate an agreeable task and payment. Should a creature
      join your party, it counts as a member of the group and receives a full
      portion of any experience gained.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare: </strong></em><strong>Cruel Planar Ally. </strong>The
      creature&nbsp;summoned by this spell is always a fiend linked&nbsp;to you.
      The bargaining costs for all requests made&nbsp;with the fiend are halved,
      but in exchange the&nbsp;fiend uses the link to gain advantage on
      saving&nbsp;throws and checks made to avoid being banished&nbsp;or bound,
      it has resistance to all damage, and each&nbsp;time the fiend takes damage
      you take an equal&nbsp;amount of damage. Damage inflicted by
      this&nbsp;spell cannot kill you.</p>
