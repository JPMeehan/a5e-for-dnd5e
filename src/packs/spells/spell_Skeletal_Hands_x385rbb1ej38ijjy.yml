    value: >-
      <p>Dozens of skeletal hands reach from a wall or other vertical surface to
      grasp a creature within 5 feet of the surface. Make a melee spell attack.
      On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and is restrained until the
      spell ends. A creature restrained by the hands can use a bonus action to
      make a Strength saving throw to escape, ending the spell early on a
      success. On a failure, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage. When the
      spell ends, the hands withdraw into the wall.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong></em> The spell&rsquo;s
      initial damage and damage on a failed escape attempt increase by 1d8 per
      slot level above 1st.</p>
