  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, you create an image that appears completely real.
      The illusion includes sounds, smells, and temperature in addition to
      visual phenomena. None of the effects of the illusion are able to cause
      actual harm.</p><p>While within range you can use an action to move the
      illusion. As the image moves you may also change its appearance to make
      the movement seem natural (like a roc moving its wings to fly) and also
      change the nonvisual elements of the illusion for the same reason (like
      the sound of beating wings as the roc flies).</p><p>Any physical
      interaction immediately reveals the image is an illusion, as objects and
      creatures alike pass through it. An Investigation check against your spell
      save DC also reveals the image is an illusion.</p><p>When a creature
      realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that
      creature.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When cast
      using a 6th-level spell slot the illusion lasts until dispelled without
      requiring concentration.</p>
