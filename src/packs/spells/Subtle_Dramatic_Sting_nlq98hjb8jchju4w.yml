      terrifying sound effects. It takes 1d4 psychic damage and becomes
      frightened of you until the spell ends.</p><p>At the end of each of the
      creature's turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the
      effect on itself on a success. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4
      psychic damage.</p><p>You cannot cast another spell through your
      spellcasting focus while concentrating on this
      spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage

      u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Subtle Dramatic Sting.</strong> When you cast
      this spell, make a Performance check opposed by the targetâ€™s Perception
      check. On a success, the target is affected by the spell but does not
      realize it is being targeted by a spell. Each round at the start of its
      turn, the target gains an expertise die on a Perception check made against
      the result of your Performance check to realize it has been targeted by a
