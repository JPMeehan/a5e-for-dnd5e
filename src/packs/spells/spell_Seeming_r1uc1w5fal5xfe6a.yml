    description: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends or you use an action to dispel it, you can change
      the appearance of the targets. The spell disguises their clothing,
      weapons, and items as well as changes to their physical appearance. An
      unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw to avoid being affected
      by the spell.</p>

      <p>You can alter the appearance of the target as you see fit, including
      but not limited to: its heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing,
      tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye
      coloration, sex and any other distinguishing features.</p>

      <p>You cannot disguise the target as a creature of a different size
      category, and its limb structure remains the same; for example if it's
      bipedal, you can't use this spell to make it appear as a quadruped.</p>

      <p>The disguise does not hold up to physical inspection. A creature that
      tries to grab an illusory hat, for example, finds its hand passes straight
      through the figment. To see through your disguise without such an
      inspection, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check
      against your spell save DC.</p>
