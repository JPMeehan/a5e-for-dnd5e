    value: >-
      <p>A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light.&nbsp;When a creature
      enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the
      area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving throw,
      taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
      success.</p><p>Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a
      failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while
      within the spell's light.</p><p>On your turn, you may use an action to
      move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
      above 2nd.</p><p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Cursed
      Moonbeam.&nbsp;</strong>An ominous moon&nbsp;of darkness appears above the
      target location. The&nbsp;cursed moon emanates no light and deals
      necrotic&nbsp;damage as grasping shadows tear into creatures in&nbsp;the
      spell&rsquo;s area. On a failed saving throw, a
      creature&rsquo;s&nbsp;speed is halved until the start of its next
      turn.</p><p>Celestial creatures have disadvantage on this saving
      throw.</p>
