      <p>On each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell uses its
      action to take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest
      available route. If there is nowhere it can move, it remains stationary.
      When the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line
      of sight to you, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the
      spell's effects on it on a successful save.</p>

      becomes frightened until the spell ends and must drop whatever it is
      holding.</p><p>On each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell
