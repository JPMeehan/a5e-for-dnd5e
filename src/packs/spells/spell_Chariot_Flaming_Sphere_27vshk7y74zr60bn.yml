  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears within range, lasting for the
      duration. It casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for
      another 20 feet, and ignites unattended flammable objects it
      touches.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to move the sphere up to 30
      feet. It can jump over pits 10 feet wide or obstacles 5 feet tall. If you
      move the sphere into a creature, the sphere ends its movement for that
      turn and the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire
      damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature
      that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving
      throw against the sphere's damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
      above 2nd.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Chariot
      Flaming Sphere.</strong> If you are Medium or smaller you can use 5 feet
      of your movement to enter or exit the sphere. While inside, you canâ€™t be
      harmed by the sphere, you move with it when it moves, and creatures take
      1d4 fire damage when they hit you with a melee attack.</p>
