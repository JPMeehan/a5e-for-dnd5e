  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Gravity reverses in the area. Any creatures or objects not anchored to
      the ground fall upward until they reach the top of the area. A creature
      may make a Dexterity saving throw to prevent the fall by grabbing hold of
      something. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the
      affected creatures and objects impact against it with the same force as a
      downward fall. When an object or creature reaches the top of the area, it
      remains suspended there until the spell ends.</p><p>When the spell ends,
      all affected objects and creatures fall back down.</p>
