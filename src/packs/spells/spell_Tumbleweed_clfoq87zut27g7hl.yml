    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">With silken words you conjure an orb of web within range.
      Standing four feet in diameter, it rolls across the battlefield, to and
      fro, at your direction. At the start of each of your turns the Tumbleweb
      can move up to 30ft, including over obstacles and up walls or other
      objects. The tumbleweb ignores all forms of difficult terrain.</p><p
      dir="ltr">When the tumbleweb enters a creature&rsquo;s square, or a
      creature passes through the tumbleweb&rsquo;s square, the creature must
      make a dexterity saving throw or become grappled by the tumbleweb.
      Grappling does not impede the tumbleweb&rsquo;s movement, and the
      tumbleweb cannot be moved by creatures that it has grappled. The tumbleweb
      gains size based on the amount and size of creatures grappled by it. With
      4 medium creatures making it large sized, four large creatures making it
      huge sized, and so forth. The tumbleweb can only grapple creatures that
      are up to one size category larger than itself.</p><p dir="ltr">As a bonus
      action, you can cause the tumbleweb to roll, swiftly, up to 30ft. If you
      do so, each creature grappled by the tumbleweb takes 1d6 damage per 10ft
      of movement they are forced to take.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of a
      grappled creature&rsquo;s turn, it may attempt a strength save to free
      itself from the tumbleweb.</p>
