    value: >-
      <p>You speak a command to the target that it can perform in a single turn.
      The action cannot be one that would result in the creature&rsquo;s demise
      such as stabbing itself or stepping off of a high cliff, but is otherwise
      unrestricted. While the spell is active, at the beginning of the
      target&rsquo;s turns, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds,
      it suffers no ill effects and may act normally. If it fails, it can either
      perform the action you commanded, ending the spell, or gain a distress
      charge, then take 1d4 psychic damage for each distress charge it has.</p>
