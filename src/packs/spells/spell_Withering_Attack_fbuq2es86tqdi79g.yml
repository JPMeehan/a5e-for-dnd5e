      <p>You weapon pulses with fell energy, ready to curse a foe who dares to
      move from their current position.</p><p>As part of the action to cast this
      spell, make an attack with your melee weapon.&nbsp;On a hit, tendrils of
      accursed energy surround the target, threatening it to remain in
      place.&nbsp;If the creature moves voluntarily before the end of its next
      turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
      DC.&nbsp;A creature that fails its save takes 1d8 points of
      <em>necrotic</em> damage and is <em>rattled</em>.&nbsp;Involuntary
      movement does not trigger this additional damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast
      at Higher Levels: </em></strong>At 5th level, the target takes an
      additional 1d8 points of <em>necrotic</em> damage on a hit and the curse
      damage for moving increases to 2d8.&nbsp;At 11th level, the target takes
      an additional 2d8 points of&nbsp;<em>necrotic</em> damage on a hit and the
      curse damage for moving increases to 3d8.&nbsp;At 17th level, the target
      takes an additional 3d8 points of&nbsp;<em>necrotic</em> damage on a hit
      and the curse damage for moving increases to 4d8.</p>
