  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You return the target to life, provided its soul is willing and able to
      return to its body. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point. The
      spell cannot return an undead creature to life.</p><p>The spell cures any
      poisons and nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time of
      death. It does not remove any magical diseases, curses, or other magical
      effects; these must be removed prior to the spell being cast, otherwise
      they immediately take effect when the creature returns to life.</p><p>The
      spell does not regrow limbs or organs, and it automatically fails if the
      target is missing any body parts necessary for life (like its heart or
      head).</p><p>Being raised from the dead takes a toll on the body, mind,
      and spirit. The target suffers 3 levels of fatigue and strife. At the
      conclusion of each long rest, the target removes one level of fatigue and
      strife until the target completely recovers.</p>
