      <p dir="ltr">You call upon your magical ability to bring order out of
      chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">All printed materials in the spell&rsquo;s area are
      organized by whatever method you choose, cleaned, minor damage (like tea
      stains on pages, dog-earing, and cracked spines) is fixed and the
      collection is stacked neatly into piles or, if shelving is available,
      shelved as you choose. You may choose to hide up to 5 tiny items among the
      stacks. Investigation checks to find these items have a DC equal to your
      spell save DC.</p><p dir="ltr">The notebook used in the casting of the
      spell fills with one of three types of text chosen when you cast the
      spell:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">The first option is to have the notebook fill itself
      with a full catalog of the collected materials. If you select this option,
      as long as the collection doesn&rsquo;t change substantially and you
      retain the notebook, you gain a d6 expertise die on all Investigation
      checks to research things using the collected materials as long as the
      Narrator determines they contain useful information and you can read
      them.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">The second option is that the notebook fills up with
      notes on where to find information on a specific topic of your choice in
      the collection. If you select this option, as long as the collection
      doesn&rsquo;t change substantially and you retain the notebook, you make a
      single Investigation check to find information on a specific topic with
      advantage.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">The third option is the notebook fills up with
      information necessary to help you understand texts you cannot read. This
      will let you know how to begin piecing together a guide to translate a
      dead language or break the cipher in some encoded text. The specifics of
      this are up to the Narrator.</p></li></ul>
