      <p dir="ltr">You summon up a set of heavy, spiked chains made of hellish
      metal to bind and constrict your foe.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">When you cast this spell, a set of heavy metal chains covered
      in barbs wrap around the target, which must make a Strength saving throw.
      On a failed save, the chains deal 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 psychic
      damage to the target. The creature is also grappled (escape DC equal to
      your spell save DC).&nbsp; A creature that succeeds on its save takes half
      damage and is still grappled, but rolls its attempts to escape with
      advantage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Each time the target begins its turn grappled this way, the
      creature takes 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 psychic damage as the chains
      constrict them.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-4d03dbe3-7fff-ca81-dc22-3206396c9449">Cast At
      Higher Levels. </strong>The initial damage increases by 1d6 piercing and
      1d6 psychic damage for each spell slot level above 3rd.</p>
