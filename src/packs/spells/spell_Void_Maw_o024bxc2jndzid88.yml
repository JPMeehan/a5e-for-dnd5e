    value: >-
      <p>You reach out into the perilous void to create an orb of hungry
      shadows, making a ranged spell attack that deals 1d6 necrotic damage.
      Inanimate corpses and Tiny or smaller nonmagical objects hit by this spell
      disintegrate into nothing. If this spell kills a creature, the corpse
      disintegrates into nothing. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this
      spell is not consumed until it fails its final&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">death saving throw</span>&nbsp;.</p>

      <p>The spell&rsquo;s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level
      (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
