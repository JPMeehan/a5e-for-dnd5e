  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, the target rises vertically in the air up to 20
      feet and remains floating there, able to move only by pushing or pulling
      on fixed objects or surfaces within its reach. This allows the target to
      move as if it was climbing.</p><p>On subsequent turns, you can use your
      action to alter the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction
      so long as it remains within range. If you have targeted yourself you may
      move up or down as part of your movement.</p><p>The target floats gently
      to the ground if it is still in the air when the spell
      ends.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a
      5th-level spell slot the target can levitate or come to the ground at
      will. When using a 7th-level spell slot its duration increases to 1 hour
      and it no longer requires concentration.</p>
