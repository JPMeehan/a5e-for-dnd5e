    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You call up a floating tablet made of stone and inscribed
      with holy text to protect you and smite your enemies.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The stone begins with 3 charges. It orbits around your body,
      protecting you from attacks. The stone sheds bright light to a range equal
      to 10 feet times the number of charges remaining and dim light to double
      that range.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">When you are hit with an attack, you may use your reaction to
      interpose the stone between you and the attack, granting you an AC bonus
      equal to the number of charges the stone has remaining against that
      attack, potentially turning the hit into a miss. Whenever an attack is
      canceled this way, the stone loses a charge and the attacking creature
      takes 2d6 points of radiant damage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">On your turn, you may use a bonus action to spend 1 or more
      charges from the stone to blast a target within 60 feet with a ranged
      spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 points of radiant damage for
      each charge spent this way.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">When the last charge is spent, or if you drop or lose
      concentration on the spell, the stone crumbles away and you are healed a
      number of hit points equal to 1d4 + your spell modifier. This healing does
      not trigger if you are unconscious.</p>

      id="docs-internal-guid-bdfa226a-7fff-1451-c06b-b25c264dadca">Cast At
      Higher Levels.</strong> The stone begins with an additional charge for
      each spell slot level above 3rd.</p>
