    value: >-
      <p>A 5-foot-diameter whirlwind appears within range, lasting for the
      duration. It extinguishes nonmagical flames within 20 feet. It also picks
      up unattended objects within 10 feet weighing 20 pounds or less, and
      flings them 10 feet in a random direction. You can use a bonus action to
      move the whirlwind up to 30 feet. It can jump over pits 10 feet wide or
      obstacles 5 feet tall. If you move the whirlwind into a creature, the
      whirlwind ends its movement for that turn and the creature makes a
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or
      half as much on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn within 5
      feet of the whirlwind makes a Dexterity saving throw against the
      whirlwind&rsquo;s damage.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</strong></p><p>The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
      above 2nd.</p>
