  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A bolt of lightning arcs out from you in a direction you choose. Each
      creature in the area takes 8d6 lightning damage. The lightning ignites
      flammable objects in its path that aren't worn or carried by another
      creature.</p>

      <p>If the spell is stopped by an object at least as large as its width, it
      ends there unless it deals enough damage to break through. When it does,
      it continues to the end of its area.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Damage increases by
      1d6 for every slot level above 3rd.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Rare:&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Conductive Lightning
      Bolt.&nbsp;</strong>Metallic&nbsp;creatures and creatures wearing metal
      armor&nbsp;make their saving throw with disadvantage.</p>
