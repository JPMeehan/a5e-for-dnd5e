  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You briefly go into a magical trance and whisper an alien equation
      which you never fully remember once the spell is complete. Each creature
      in the area takes 3d4 psychic damage and is deafened for 1
      round.</p><p>Creatures who are unable to hear the equation, immune to
      psychic damage, or who have an Intelligence score lower than 4 are immune
      to this spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong>
      Creatures are deafened for 1 additional round for each slot level above
      1st.</p>
