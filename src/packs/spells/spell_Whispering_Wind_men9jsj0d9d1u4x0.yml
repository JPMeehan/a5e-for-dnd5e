    value: >-
      <p>You choose a point that is familiar to you within range and send a
      message or sound, as long as there is a clear air path to the target. The
      message travels as a gentle breeze, traveling between 1 and 6 miles per
      hour.</p><p>The message you send can be up to twenty-five words, or
      otherwise be a sound of up to six seconds. When the wind reaches its
      destination, it delivers its message regardless if anyone is there to hear
      it. The words cannot activate any magical effects or be used to supply any
      voiced components.</p><p>Cast at Higher Levels. Increase the spell&rsquo;s
      range by 2 miles for every slot level above 2nd.</p>
