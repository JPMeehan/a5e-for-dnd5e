    value: >-
      <p>As part of the casting of this spell, you lay down in the coffin on a
      patch of bare earth and it buries itself. Over the following week, you are
      incapacitated and do not need air, food, or sleep. Your insides are eaten
      by worms, but you do not die and your skin remains intact. If you are
      exhumed during this time, or if the spell is otherwise interrupted, you
      die.</p><p>At the end of the week, the transformation is complete and your
      true form is permanently changed. Your appearance is unchanged but
      underneath your skin is a sentient mass of worms. Any creature that makes
      a Medicine check against your spell save DC realizes that there is
      something moving underneath your skin.</p><p>Your statistics change in the
      following ways:</p><ul><li>Your type changes to aberration, and you do not
      age or require sleep.</li><li>You cannot be healed by normal means, but
      you can spend an action or bonus action to consume 2d6 live worms,
      regaining an equal amount of hit points by adding them to your
      body.</li><li>You can sense and telepathically control all worms that have
      the beast type and are within 60 feet of you.</li></ul><p>In addition, you
      are able to discard your shell of skin and travel as a writhing mass of
      worms. As an action, you can abandon your skin and pour out onto the
      ground. In this form you have the statistics of <strong>swarm of
