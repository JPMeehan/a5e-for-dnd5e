  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Name or describe in detail a creature familiar to you. The spell
      reveals the general direction the creature is in (south, east, northwest,
      and so on) if it exists within range. This includes its current trajectory
      if it's travelling.</p><p>You may locate specific, known creatures, or the
      nearest creature of a specific type (like a bat, gnome, or red dragon)
      provided that you have observed that type within 30 feet at least once. If
      a specific creature you seek is in a different form (for example a
      wildshaped druid) the spell is unable to find it.</p><p>The spell cannot
      travel across running water 10 feet across or wider&mdash;it is unable to
      find the creature and the trail ends.</p>
