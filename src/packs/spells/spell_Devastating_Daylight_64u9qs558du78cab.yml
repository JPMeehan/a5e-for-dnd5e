    value: >-
      <p>Magical light fills the area. The area is brightly lit and sheds dim
      light for an additional 60 feet. If any of the area overlaps with magical
      darkness created by a spell of 3rd-level or lower, the spell that created
      the darkness is dispelled.</p>

      <p>When cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the
      light shines from it and moves with it. Completely covering the object
      with something that is not transparent blocks the light.</p>

      <p><strong>Rare:&nbsp;Devastating Daylight. </strong>While within the
      area, you or an ally can use a bonus action to grab a spear from the light
      and hurl it at a creature or object within 60 feet, making a&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">ranged weapon attack</span> that deals 4d4
      radiant damage + the wielder&rsquo;s Strength or Dexterity modifier
      (whichever is higher). For every spear of daylight taken from the area,
      the duration of the light is reduced by 10 minutes.</p>
