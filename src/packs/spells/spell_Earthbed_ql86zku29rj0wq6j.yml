      <p dir="ltr">You lie down and the earth swallows you, pulling you into a
      healing embrace.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">For the duration of the spell, you are buried in the earth in
      a state of suspended animation and do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
      You have total cover and concealment and while you can be located with
      magic or by digging, there is no obvious sign of your presence on the
      surface. If you remain buried for the spell&rsquo;s entire duration, you
      emerge fully restored. This spell ends any and all conditions affecting
      you (including all accumulated levels of Fatigue and Strife and Doomed),
      neutralizes all poisons and diseases affecting you, and restores all hit
      dice and hit points. At your option, you can allow this process to
      transform you, emerging as a different creature as if reincarnation had
      been cast on&nbsp; your body.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, if you are dug up and attacked during the
      spell&rsquo;s duration, you are vulnerable to all damage and do not awaken
      from taking it (a friendly creature can awaken you with a Medicine check
      with a DC equal to your spell save DC; each attempt to wake you takes 1
      minute). If you die this way, you cannot be restored to life by any means
      short of true resurrection or wish.</p>
