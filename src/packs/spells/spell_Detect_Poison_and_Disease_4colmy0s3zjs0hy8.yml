      <p>On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until
      the spell ends, you can attempt to sense the presence of poisons,
      poisonous creatures, and disease by making a Perception check. On a
      success you identify the type of each poison or disease within range.
      Typically noticing and identifying a poison or disease is a DC 10 check,
      but the Narrator may use DC 15 for uncommon afflictions, DC 20 for rare
      afflictions, or DC 25 for afflictions that are truly unique. On a failed
      check, this casting of the spell cannot sense that specific poison or
      disease.</p>

      <p>The spell penetrates most barriers but is blocked by 3 feet of wood or
      dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of
      lead.</p>
