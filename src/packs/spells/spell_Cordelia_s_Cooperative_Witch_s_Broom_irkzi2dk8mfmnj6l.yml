      dir="ltr">You touch a broom and bring it to life. The broom stands and
      moves on its own, and will follow you unless commanded to stay in place.
      You may issue basic commands to the broom, such as instructing it on a
      specific spot that needs cleaning. If no commands are issued, the broom
      will start to idly clean the immediate area. An animated broom can
      completely sweep a 10-foot by 10-foot space in 1 minute, thoroughly
      removing dust, debris, and signs of foot traffic, such as tracks.</p><p

      dir="ltr"><strong>Cordelia&rsquo;s Cooperative Witch&rsquo;s
      Broom.</strong> The spell&rsquo;s duration increases to 10 minutes.
      Additionally, the broom sprouts a pair of arms and can perform basic
      tasks, such as carrying objects for you or providing an extra pair of
      hands to assist you. If summoned in combat, the broom cannot attack, but
      it can flank an enemy.</p>
