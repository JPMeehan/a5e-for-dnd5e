  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A 60-foot radius storm cloud that is 10 feet high appears in a space
      100 feet above you. If there is not a point in the air above you that the
      storm cloud could appear, the spell fails (such as if you are in a small
      cavern or indoors).</p><p>On the round you cast it, and as an action on
      subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can call down a bolt of
      lightning to a point directly beneath the cloud. Each creature within 5
      feet of the point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning
      damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p><p>If you
      are outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, you take control of the
      storm instead of creating a new cloud and the spell's damage is increased
      by 1d10.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage
      increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
