      <p dir="ltr">You curse the language of your foes, casting them into
      disarray.</p><p dir="ltr">Each creature in the spell&rsquo;s area that
      fails its save immediately begins speaking a brand-new language unique to
      itself. The creature perceives itself as speaking the language it has
      always spoken, but in reality is instead speaking an entirely new tongue
      with its own vocabulary and grammar. This extends even to writing and sign
      language. The only way to communicate with affected creatures is via the
      tongues spell (or a comprehend languages spell for writing) or telepathy.
      An affected creature can repeat the saving throw every hour, ending the
      effect for itself on a success.</p><p dir="ltr">A creature that succeeds
      on its saving throw has disadvantage on all Intelligence ability checks
      and saves for one minute instead.</p>
