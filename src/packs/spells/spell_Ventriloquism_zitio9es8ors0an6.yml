      <p>You can throw your words, or any other sound you could make with your
      voice, making them appear to originate from a different point within
      range. Anyone who hears the sounds may make a Wisdom saving throw,
      recognizing the effect as illusory on a success.</p><p><strong>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</strong> The spell&rsquo;s range increases to medium (60
      feet) if you cast it with a 2nd-level spell slot, and to long (120 feet)
      if you cast it with a 3rd-level or higher spell slot.</p>
