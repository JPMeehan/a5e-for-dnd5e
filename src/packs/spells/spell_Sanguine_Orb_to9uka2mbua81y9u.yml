    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">With dark words and a twist of your hands you cast forth an
      orb of mingled blood and torment which drifts forward, harming those it
      approaches&hellip; Though with words of sacrifice, the blood may be turned
      to good.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You create a floating orb which travels 20ft in a straight
      line of your choosing. This orb deals 5 points of necrotic damage to any
      creature whose square it passes through, up to a maximum of 20 damage
      before it dissipates. If the orb runs into a wall or other large object,
      it bounces off at a random angle. Roll 1d8 assigning each direction to
      each number, and if it would travel into the object, it instead rebounds
      directly on its previous path. The ball moves at the start of each of your
      turns.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Alternatively, you may choose to cast this spell as a healing
      spell. In which case it heals 5 points of damage to creatures whose space
      it passes through, up to a maximum of 20 points. A creature can only
      benefit from the healing of a single casting of Sanguine Orb once.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-80957b55-7fff-b197-4265-fb3396d22ee7">Cast At
      Higher Levels. </strong>For each level above 1st, this spell deals or
      heals an additional 3 points per target, and its maximum value increases
      by 5.</p>
