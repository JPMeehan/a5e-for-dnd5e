      <p>The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack during this
      spell&rsquo;s duration, your weapon glows with purifying light, and the
      attack deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target. For the duration
      of the spell, creatures who make saving throws against ongoing negative
      effects originating from the target have advantage on those saving throws.
      Additionally, if the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it must make a Wisdom
      saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained until the end of its next
      turn.</p><p><strong>Casting At Higher Levels:</strong> If you cast this
      spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
      1d6 for each slot level above 1st. If you cast this spell using a spell
      slot of 4th level or higher, the target is also subject to your choice of
      either
      a&nbsp;<em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel
      Magic} </em>or
      a&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.l16wg9h1z9s16exb]{Remove
      Curse} effect. This secondary effect replicates a spell slot one level
      lower than the one used to cast the spell. For example, when casting
      Purifying Strike with a 4th-level spell slot, the <em>remove curse</em>
      effect behaves as if it was cast with a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>
