      <p>Each creature of your choice within the area is filled with
      uncontrollable rage. Willing creatures can voluntarily fail their saves to
      gain the benefits. Affected creatures attack with reckless abandon,
      gaining advantage to their attack rolls but granting advantage on attacks
      against them. Affected creatures must make an attack on their turn; if
      they are unable to make an attack against a creature, they must use their
      action to dash to the nearest enemy or spend their action furiously
      thrashing and attacking nearby objects. Affected creatures are unable to
      cast spells. Affected creatures can make Wisdom saving throws at the end
      of each of their turns to end this effect if they so choose.</p>
