    value: >-
      <p>Negative energy wracks the target and deals 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage. A
      humanoid killed by this spell turns into a zombie at the start of your
      next turn. It is permanently under your control and follows your spoken
      commands.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 7th.</p><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Shadowed Finger of
      Death.</strong> This spellâ€™s duration is 1 hour. You can store the spell
      harmlessly on a willing creature, causing an inky stain to appear on its
      finger. That creature can touch or make an unarmed melee attack to deliver
      the spell to a target, triggering the damage on a hit. The spell ends on a
      hit or miss.</p>
