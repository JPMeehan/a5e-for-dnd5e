      <p>You touch a statue and transform it into a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.y1ll3gvbdtmd86e1]{Walking Statue}. The
      walking statue is either Medium or Large, depending on the original
      statue&rsquo;s size, and its Intelligence is 8 (&ndash;1); otherwise, its
      statistics are unchanged.</p>

      <p>This stone sentinel is not under your control. Instead, it remains
      dormant in its original position. It is indistinguishable from a normal
      statue until it perceives a law being broken, at which point it takes
      action. The walking statue is aware of all laws in the book used as the
      material component, though its understanding of the law is literal and
      without nuance. You can update the laws for a stone sentinel you have
      created with another casting of this spell, using the new law book as the
      material component.</p>

      <p>Each time you cast the spell, you can choose between three sets of
      instructions, which the walking statue will carry out to the best of its
      ability.</p>

      <ol>

      <li><strong>Apprehend Criminals. </strong>When the sentinel perceives a
      major or minor law being broken, it chases the lawbreaker and attacks
      them. If it loses sight of a lawbreaker or if the lawbreaker is reduced to
      0 hit points, the sentinel returns to its original location and position
      and returns to its dormant state. The stone statue&rsquo;s attacks are
      non-lethal: a creature reduced to 0 hit points by the stone sentinel is
      knocked
      @UUID[Compendium.SharedCompendia.a5e.LLf0DCh9ZIJ0oPRN.JournalEntryPage.HJBw8njC5b21tHzD]{unconcious}and
      considered stable.</li>

      <li><strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Apprehend Criminals with Extreme
      Prejudice. </strong><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">As Apprehend
      Criminals, but the stone sentinel&rsquo;s attacks are not
      nonlethal.</span></li>

      <li><strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Keep Watch. </strong><span
      style="font-size: 10.5pt;">When the stone sentinel perceives a crime, it
      does not move or attack. Instead, it sounds the alarm, shouting the nature
      of the crime, as well as the direction and description of the lawbreaker.
      It continues to shout the crime and the last known direction and
      description for 5 rounds.</span></li>
