  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You repair a single rip or break in the target object (for example, a
      cracked goblet, torn page, or ripped robe). The break must be smaller than
      1 foot in all dimensions. The spell leaves no trace that the object was
      damaged.</p><p>Magic items and constructs may be repaired in this way, but
      their magic is not restored. You gain an expertise die on maintenance
      checks if you are able to cast this spell on the item you are
      treating.</p>
