  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a spirit that takes the form of a loyal mount, creating a
      lasting bond with it. You decide on the steed's appearance, and choose
      whether it uses the statistics of an elk, giant lizard, panther, warhorse,
      or wolf (the Narrator may offer additional options.) Its statistics change
      in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Its type is your choice of celestial,
      fey, or fiend.</li><li>Its size is your choice of Medium or
      Large.</li><li>Its Intelligence is 6.</li><li>You can communicate with it
      telepathically while it's within 1 mile.</li><li>It understands one
      language that you speak.</li></ul><p>While mounted on your steed, when you
      cast a spell that targets only yourself, you may also target the
      steed.</p><p>When you use an action to dismiss the steed, or when it drops
      to 0 hit points, it temporarily disappears. Casting this spell again
      resummons the steed, fully healed and with all conditions removed. You
      can't summon a different steed unless you spend an action to release your
      current steed from its bond, permanently dismissing
      it.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The steed has
      an additional 20 hit points for each slot level above 2nd. When using a
      4th-level spell slot or higher, you may grant the steed either a swim
      speed or fly speed equal to its base Speed.</p>
