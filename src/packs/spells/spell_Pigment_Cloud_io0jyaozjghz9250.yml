    value: >-
      <p>You create a&nbsp;<em><span class="freelinking-link">heavily
      obscured</span></em>&nbsp;area of multicolored fog. The fog spreads around
      corners and can be dispersed by a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per
      hour). Any creature that moves through this cloud on their turn or that
      starts their turn there is covered in a rainbow of colorful pigments and
      while covered in this way they leave multicolored footprints and trails of
      pigment behind them as they move for the duration of the spell. Checks
      made to see or track creatures covered in such pigment are made
      at&nbsp;<em><span class="freelinking-link">advantage</span></em>. These
      pigments are removed if the affected creature is fully submerged in water
      or similar liquid.</p>

      <p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.&nbsp;</strong>The spell&rsquo;s radius
      increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
