  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You send a message of 25 words or less to the target. It recognizes you
      as the sender and can reply immediately in kind. The message travels
      across any distance and into other planes of existence. If the target is
      on a different plane of existence than you, there is a 5% chance it
      doesn't receive your message. A target with an Intelligence score of at
      least 1 understands your message as you intend it (whether you share a
      language or not).</p>
