      <p>You create a wall of continuous vertical bolts of lightning. The wall
      can rest on a solid surface or be free floating, and be in any orientation
      of your choosing. The wall can be up to 60 feet long (it does not have to
      be a straight line; sections of the wall can angle as long as they are
      contiguous), 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall blocks sight, and
      emits bright light out to 120 feet and dim light for an additional 120
      feet in all directions.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature in its
      area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning damage and
      being blinded for 1 minute on a failed save; it takes half as much damage
      and is not blinded on a successful save. A blinded creature makes a
      Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
      blindness on itself on a success.</p><p>A creature takes 4d8 lightning
      damage if it ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall. It also takes this
      damage the first time it enters the wall&rsquo;s space on a round. A
      creature ending its turn within 5 feet of the wall must make a
      Constitution saving throw or be blinded, as above.</p><p><strong>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level
      above 5th.</p>
