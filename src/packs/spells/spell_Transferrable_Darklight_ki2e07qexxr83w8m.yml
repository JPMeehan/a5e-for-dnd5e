      <p>You create an enchanted flame that surrounds your hand and produces no
      heat, but sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius around you and dim light
      for an additional 20 feet. Only you and up to 6 creatures of your choice
      can see this light.</p>

      <p><strong>Rare: Transferrable Darklight.</strong> During the spell’s
      duration, you can use an action to kindle this light on a willing
      creature’s hand, sharing the effect with them. When the spell’s duration
      ends, or when any of the flames are dispelled, the spell ends.</p>
