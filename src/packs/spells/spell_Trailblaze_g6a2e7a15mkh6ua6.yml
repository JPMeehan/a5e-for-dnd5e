      <p><em><strong>Association:</strong> Ranger class</em></p><p>You cut a
      path for others to follow, easing the journey for those who come after
      you.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you leave a magically-cleared trail
      behind you. While creating the trail neither you nor your companions can
      use the Cover Tracks activity. The trail must follow a single route; if
      you backtrack or cross over the path cleared by this spell before the
      spell ends, its effect is suppressed until you resume travel from its
      farthest tip.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The magically cleared trail is 10 feet
      wide and made from packed soil, and it lasts indefinitely. Non-magical
      vegetation and hazards are cleared from the path. Subtle warding magic
      automatically disarms and dispels natural hazards with a save DC less than
      your spell save DC.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who follow the trail cannot become
      lost except due to spell effects of 2nd-level and stronger. They also gain
      an expertise die on Survival checks made while journeying along the
      trail.&nbsp;</p>
