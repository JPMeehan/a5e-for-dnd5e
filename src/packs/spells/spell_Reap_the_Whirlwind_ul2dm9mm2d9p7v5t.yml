    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">Your foes have sown the wind and you will make them reap the
      whirlwind.</p><p dir="ltr">You brandish your weapon and are carried aloft
      by powerful winds to strike your foes with terrible force. Make a melee
      spell attack against each target. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force
      damage and must make a Strength save or be flung up to 30 feet in a
      direction of your choosing (&ldquo;up&rdquo; is a valid choice; a creature
      flung into the air falls normally). In addition, strong winds blow through
      the entire area, extinguishing non-magical flames the size of a torch or
      smaller and flinging papers, leaves and other lightweight debris into the
      air. After the results of your attacks are determined, the entire area
      becomes lightly obscured until the beginning of your next turn, and you
      can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see adjacent to one of the
      targets (regardless of whether you hit or missed).</p>
