  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Necrotic energies drain moisture and vitality from the target, dealing
      8d8 necrotic damage. Undead and constructs are immune to this
      spell.</p><p>A plant creature or magical plant has disadvantage on its
      saving throw and takes the maximum damage possible from this spell. A
      nonmagical plant that isn't a creature receives no saving throw and
      instead withers until dead.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
      above 4th.</p>
