    value: >-
      <p>You charge your weapon with electricity and strike with it, jolting
      your target and its nearby allies.</p><p>As part of the action to cast
      this spell, make an attack with your melee weapon. If you hit with the
      weapon attack, in addition to dealing normal weapon damage, electricity
      jolts your primary target and jumps to a secondary target within 5 feet,
      dealing lightning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to
      each.</p><p>Beginning at 5th level, the damage done to the primary and
      secondary targets increases by 1d8 lightning damage. At 11th level, the
      damage to the primary target increases to 2d8. You can select an
      additional secondary target within range of any of the previous targets,
      and the range to each secondary target increases to 10 feet. At 17th
      level, the damage to the primary target increases to 3d8. You can select
      two additional secondary targets, each within range of any of the previous
      targets, and the secondary target range increases to 15 feet.</p>
