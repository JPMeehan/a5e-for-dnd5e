      effects, chosen when casting the spell.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Enlarged:</strong></em> Plants in the area are greatly

      as normal.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rapid:</strong></em> All nonmagical plants in the area
      surge with the power of life. A creature that moves through the area must

      Growth.&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;spell doesn&rsquo;t require the presence
      of pre-existing&nbsp;vegetation to take effect, but must use the

      fading away.</p>
