      <p>You imbue the target with a preternatural understanding of stone. The
      target gains tremorsense out to a distance of 60 feet.</p>

      <p>Whenever the target makes a History check related to the origin of
      stonework, it is considered proficient in the History skill and gains an
      expertise die on the check. If the target already has the Stonecunning
      trait, it makes the check with advantage.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if the target is underground, it can make a DC 10
      Intelligence check to correctly determine the distance between itself and
      the surface, or to perfectly recall any path it has traveled in the past
      week.</p>
