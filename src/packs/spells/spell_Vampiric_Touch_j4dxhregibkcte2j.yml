  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Shadows roil about your hand and heal you by siphoning away the life
      force from others. On the round you cast it, and as an action on
      subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can make a melee spell attack
      against a creature within your reach.</p><p>On a hit, you deal 3d6
      necrotic damage and regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic
      damage dealt.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
