  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You murmur a tune that takes root in the target's mind until the spell
      ends, forcing it to caper, dance, and shuffle. At the start of each of its
      turns, the dancing target must use all of its movement to dance in its
      space, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. Attacks
      made against the target have advantage. On each of its turns, the target
      can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a
      successful save.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong>
      Target one additional creature within 30 feet for each slot level above
      6th.</p>
