    value: >-
      <p>You enchant a magical line onto one of your arrows.</p>

      <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, make a ranged weapon
      attack against a target within range of your weapon. On a hit, in addition
      to dealing normal weapon damage, the ammunition from your shot leaves a
      sturdy cord behind it. It has the stats of a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.3dt9060xa6c3szrw]{Silk
      Rope} of its length. If the target was a Large-sized or smaller creature,
      you can use an action while holding the rope to make an opposed Strength
      check against the creature, pulling it 10 feet toward you on a success. If
      the target is a solid object or surface, the rope is securely anchored in
      it, and can be climbed (provided the surface or object can support the
      weight of the climbing creature). The rope persists indefinitely, but
      vanishes if cut or when you cast this spell again.</p>
