  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, make a ranged weapon
      attack against a target within range of the weapon you are wielding. On a
      hit, the ammunition from your shot leaves a sturdy cord behind it. It has
      the stats of a silk rope of its length. If the target was a creature, you
      may make an opposed Strength check as an action while holding the rope to
      pull the creature 10 feet toward you. If the target is a solid object or
      surface, the rope is securely anchored in it, and can be climbed (provided
      the surface or object can support the weight of the climbing creature).
      The rope persists indefinitely, but vanishes if you cast this spell
      again.</p>
