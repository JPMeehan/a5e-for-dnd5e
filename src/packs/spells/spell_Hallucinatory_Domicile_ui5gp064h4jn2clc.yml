  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You weave a veil over the natural terrain within the area, making it
      look, sound, or smell like another sort of terrain. A small lake could be
      made to look like a grassy glade. A path or trail could be made to look
      like an impassable swamp. A cliff face could even appear as a gentle slope
      or seem to extend further than it does. This spell does not affect any
      manufactured structures, equipment, or creatures.</p><p>Only the visual,
      auditory, and olfactory components of the terrain are changed. Any
      creature that enters or attempts to interact with the illusion feels the
      real terrain below. If given sufficient reason, a creature may make an
      Investigation check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. On a
      successful save, the creature sees the illusion superimposed over the
      actual terrain.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      spell targets an additional 50-foot cube for each slot level above
      4th.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Hallucinatory
      Domicile.</strong> The spell can affect manufactured structures. A
      crumbling and empty hut could be made to look as though it were fully
      furnished and well cared for, or a well-appointed room could be made to
      look empty.</p>
