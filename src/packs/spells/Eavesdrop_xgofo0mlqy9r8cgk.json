The glyph is visible and resembles a one-inch-tall drawing of an ear. The sensor can be covered or concealed without changing the function of the spell. A creature can wipe it away as an action, ending the spell. You can only have one such sensor active at once.</p>\n<p>While the sensor is active, you can use a bonus action to hear both through the sensor as though you were at its location and through your normal senses. This effect lasts until you end the spell as an action, use a bonus action to silence it (doing so does not end the spell), or the duration ends. While hearing through the sensor you have&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">disadvantage</span>&nbsp;on Perception checks to observe your surroundings, but not to those made to detect noises through the sensor. Additionally, you can hear through this sensor even if you are&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">deafened</span>&nbsp;. Creatures cannot hear you through the sensor.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"field field--name-field-spellcast-at-higher-levels field--type-text-long field--label-inline\">\n<div class=\"field--label\"><em style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels. </strong></em><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">When cast using a 7th-level spell slot, the spell&rsquo;s duration increases to 30 days.
