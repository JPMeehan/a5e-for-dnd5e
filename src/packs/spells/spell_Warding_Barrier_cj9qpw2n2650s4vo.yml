    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">As an attack lashes toward you, or a spell flies, you raise
      your hand to bring up a ward of force to protect yourself and those
      nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">As a reaction to an attack that targets you, or
      being in the area of a damaging spell or other effect which requires a
      Dexterity saving throw, you create a temporary waist-high force field in
      front of you that provides half cover to you and anyone behind it as
      normal cover would. Creatures behind you, relative to the source of
      danger, also gain the benefit of cover. (Half cover grants a +2 bonus to
      AC and Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.)</p><p

      id="docs-internal-guid-487c62d9-7fff-0468-bea6-bdc413276652">Cast At
      Higher Levels.</strong> Using a 2nd level or higher spell slot creates an
      identical magical barrier in front of an additional creature you can see
      within 30 feet. You can create a second such barrier if you use a spell
      slot of at least 4th level, a third with a spell slot of at least 6th
      level (and the range increases to 60 feet), and a fourth with a spell slot
      of at least 8th level. All barriers created by this spell dissipate at the
      same time.</p>
