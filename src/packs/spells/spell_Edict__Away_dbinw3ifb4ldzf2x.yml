      creatures</p><p dir="ltr">With a single imperious word you push everything
      and everyone away, sending them scrambling under the force of your
      voice.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting with the target with the lowest hit points
      (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets within the area are pushed 5ft
      away from you and are knocked prone.</p><p dir="ltr">As each target is
      shoved, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the
      next target. A target&rsquo;s hit points must be equal to or less than the
      total remaining for the spell to have any effect.</p><p dir="ltr">If the
      spell shoves no creatures, the creature in the area with the lowest hit
      point total is rattled until the beginning of its next turn.</p><p
