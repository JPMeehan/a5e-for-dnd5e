  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a roiling, noxious cloud that hinders creatures and leaves
      them retching. The cloud spreads around corners and lingers in the air
      until the spell ends.</p>

      <p>The area is heavily obscured. A creature in the area at the start of
      its turn makes a Constitution saving throw or uses its action to retch and
      reel.&nbsp;Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison
      automatically succeed on the save.</p>

      <p>A moderate wind (10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds,
      a strong wind (20 miles per hour) after 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The spell's area
      increases by 5 feet for every 2 slot levels above 3rd.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Dyed Stinking
      Cloud.&nbsp;</strong>Choose a&nbsp;color for the cloud when you cast this
      spell.&nbsp;When a creature makes a saving throw against&nbsp;this spell
      it is dyed that color until it uses an&nbsp;action to wipe away the
      residue.</p>
