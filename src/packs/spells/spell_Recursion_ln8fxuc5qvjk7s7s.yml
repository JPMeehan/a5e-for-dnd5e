      <p dir="ltr">As the watch comes apart in your hands, gears spinning in the
      air before winking out of existence, time repeats itself. Whatever action,
      bonus action, or movement you took on your previous turn reoccurs,
      happening a second time. If you cast a spell, that spell is recast with
      the same targets. If you moved, you move again in the same direction and
      cannot vary your path. You may still take a bonus action and move normally
      on the turn you cast Recursion, either before or after Recursion&rsquo;s
      effects resolve. This spell can only reproduce up to the use of a
      5th-level spell slot. If casting Recursion would cause it to replicate the
      effects of spell using a 6th-level or higher spell slot, it fails and the
      spell is wasted.</p><p dir="ltr">Recursion has no effect on
      Recursion.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-500b2a5e-7fff-ef49-60e2-e78054f2d6c1">Cast at
      Higher Levels. </strong>For every level above 6th, the level of spell slot
      that can be reproduced by Recursion increases by 1, up to an 8th level
      spell slot if you cast it with a 9th-level spell slot.</p>
