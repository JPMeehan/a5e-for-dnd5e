  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Thick, sticky webs fill the area, lightly obscuring it and making it
      difficult terrain.</p><p>You must anchor the webs between two solid masses
      (such as walls or trees) or layer them across a flat surface. If you don't
      the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell
      ends.</p><p>Webs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.</p><p>Each
      creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its
      turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained as long as it
      remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).</p><p>A creature
      restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength
      check against your spell save DC.</p><p>Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to
      fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that
      starts its turn in the fire.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When using a 4th-level spell slot, you also summon a
      giant wolf spider in an unoccupied space within the web's area. When using
      a 6th-level spell slot, you summon up to two spiders.</p><p>When using a
      7th-level spell slot, you summon up to three spiders. The spiders are
      friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spiders as a
      group, which have their own turns. The spiders obey your verbal commands,
      but they disappear when the spell ends or when they leave the web's
      area.</p>
