      cast a handful of salt into the fire and use the patterns of the flames to
      divine the moment where you will either help or hinder. If you perform
      this reading for a friendly creature (including yourself), the next time
      that creature fails a saving throw or ability check in the next 8 hours,
      they may immediately reroll the triggering save or check and add your
      spellcasting modifier to the roll. If you perform this reading for an
      unfriendly creature and they succeed on a saving throw or ability check,
      they must immediately reroll the triggering save or check, subtracting
      your spellcasting modifier from the roll. The triggering creature must use
      the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.</span></p>
