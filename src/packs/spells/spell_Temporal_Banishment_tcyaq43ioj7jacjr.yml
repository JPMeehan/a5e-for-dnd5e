    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">Letting the grains of sand slip through your fingers, you
      displace your target in the timestream. They cease to exist for a number
      of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. They then return to reality
      exactly where they were and in the same condition as before, as if no time
      had passed for them. A creature may attempt a charisma saving throw to
      avoid being affected.</p>
