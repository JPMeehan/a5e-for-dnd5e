  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a shout to be still, you blast the area with cold rationality.
      Creatures in the area that fail their saves immediately stop feeling
      strong emotions and experience a flash of clarity. This ends the Charmed,
      Confused, Frightened, and Rattled conditions, immediately ends a
      berserker&rsquo;s rage, and stops any sort of rage or frenzy that a
      creature may be feeling. The effect makes all affected creatures
      indifferent to each other and you if their attitude was friendly or
      hostile. It also suppresses other extreme emotions, shutting off intense
      anger, sorrow, or joy. Persuasion checks based on rationality and calm
      reasoning have advantage against affected creatures for one round after
      this spell is cast; it is sometimes used to peacefully deter angry mobs
      for that reason. Finally, affected creatures have advantage on
      Intelligence checks and disadvantage on Charisma checks for one
      minute.</p>
