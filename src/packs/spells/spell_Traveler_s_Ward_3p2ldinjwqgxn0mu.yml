    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, creatures have disadvantage on Sleight of Hand
      checks made against the target.</p>

      <p>If a creature fails a Sleight of Hand check to steal from the target,
      the ward creates a loud noise and a flash of bright light easily heard and
      seen by creatures within 100 feet.</p>
