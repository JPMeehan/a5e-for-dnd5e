    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">With a harsh word and a sharp gesture you steal the very life
      essence from one target and grant it to another. The first target takes
      3d10 necrotic damage if it fails its save, or half as much if it succeeds.
      The second target may expend 1 hit die to recover hit points as if they
      had taken a short rest.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> For each level above
      2nd, increase the damage by 1d10 and the number of hit dice rolled by
      1.</p>
