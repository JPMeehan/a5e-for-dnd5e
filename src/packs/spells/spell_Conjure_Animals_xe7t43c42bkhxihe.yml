  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon forth the spirit of a beast that takes the physical form of
      your choosing in unoccupied spaces you can see.</p><p>Choose one of the
      following:</p><ul><li>One beast of CR 2 or less</li><li>Two beasts of CR 1
      or less</li><li>Three beasts of CR 1/2 or less</li></ul><p> Beasts
      summoned this way are allied to you and your companions. While it is
      within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command a summoned
      beast. When you command multiple beasts using this spell, you must give
      them all the same command. You may decide the action the beast takes and
      where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command,
      such as guarding an area. If not given a command, a conjured beast only
      defends itself.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      challenge rating of beasts you can summon increases by one step for each
      slot level above 3rd. For example, when using a 4th-level spell slot you
      can summon one beast of CR 3 or less, two beasts of CR 2 or less, or three
      beasts of CR 1 or less.</p>
