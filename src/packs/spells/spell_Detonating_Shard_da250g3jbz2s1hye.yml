      <p dir="ltr">You create a shard of superheated volcanic glass and fire it
      at your target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 points of piercing damage.
      Then, hit or miss, the shard explodes in a blast of razor-sharp,
      superheated obsidian. The target and all creatures within 5 feet of it
      must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing and 1d6 fire
      damage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-e8043721-7fff-d006-7f90-fc5bef90fabe">Cast At
      Higher Levels. </strong>The fire damage increases by 1d6 for each spell
      slot level above 1st. If you cast the spell with at least a 3rd-level
      spell slot, creatures that succeed on their save take half damage from the
      blast rather than avoiding it entirely.</p>
