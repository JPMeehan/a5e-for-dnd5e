  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in light (your
      choice of color). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also
      outlined unless it makes a Dexterity saving throw. Until the spell ends,
      affected objects and creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot
      radius.</p><p>Any attack roll against an affected object or creature has
      advantage. The spell also negates the benefits of invisibility on affected
      creatures and objects.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare:
      Rattling Faerie Fire.</strong> When an affected creature is damaged by a
      weapon attack it takes 1d4 psychic damage and is rattled until the end of
      its next turn. </p>
