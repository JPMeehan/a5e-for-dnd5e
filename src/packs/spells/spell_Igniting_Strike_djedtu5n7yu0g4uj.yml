      flashes with searing heat, setting your target ablaze.</p><p>When you deal
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.4727pnvz5nwn3h23]{Sneak
      Attack} damage with a melee attack, you may cast this spell as part of the
      Sneak Attack, transforming the bonus damage from your Sneak Attack into
      fire damage. You inflict ongoing fire damage to the attack's target, which
      has a duration of 1 minute or until the creature uses an action to
      extinguish the flames. The amount of ongoing damage improves if cast at a
      higher spell-level:</p><p><strong>1st-level: </strong>1d6 of ongoing fire
      damage .</p><p><strong>2nd-level:</strong> 2d6 of ongoing fire
      damage.</p><p><strong>3rd-level: </strong>3d6 of ongoing fire
      damage.</p><p><strong>4th-level or higher: </strong>4d6 of ongoing fire
      damage.</p><p>For the purposes of determining spells cast in a round, this
      spell counts as having a casting time of one action.</p>
