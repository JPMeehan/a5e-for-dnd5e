  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a zone that minimizes deception. Any creature that is able
      to be charmed can't speak a deliberate lie while in the area.</p><p>An
      affected creature is aware of the spell and can choose not to speak, or it
      might be evasive in its communications. A creature that enters the zone
      for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a
      Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d4 psychic
      damage when it intentionally tries to mislead or occlude important
      information. Each time the spell damages a creature, it makes a Deception
      check (DC 8 + the damage dealt) or its suffering is obvious. You know
      whether a creature succeeds on its saving throw</p>
