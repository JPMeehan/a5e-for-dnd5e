    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of slashing blades. The wall can be up to 20 feet
      high and 5 feet thick, and can either be a straight wall up to 100 feet
      long or a ringed wall of up to 60 feet in diameter. The wall provides
      three-quarters cover and its area is difficult terrain.</p><p>When a
      creature starts its turn within the wall's area or enters the wall's area
      for the first time on a turn, it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking
      6d10 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful
      save.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage
      increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
