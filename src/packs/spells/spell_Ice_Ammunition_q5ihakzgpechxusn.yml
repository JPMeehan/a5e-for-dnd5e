  description:
    value: >-
      <p>To cast this spell, you must be within 30 feet of a body of water
      containing at least 5 gallons of water or an area of dense fog.</p><p>You
      crystalize water from the environment into a piece of ammunition made of
      solid magical ice. It lasts for 1 round and then melts. When fired it
      deals an additional amount of cold damage equal to your proficiency
      modifier on a hit. After hitting, the ammunition melts away, leaving no
      trace of its existence other than a small puddle.</p>
