    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">Your magic causes a creature&rsquo;s stomach to lurch,
      violently expelling its contents.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">A target that fails its save immediately and forcefully
      vomits, expelling the contents of its stomach. This instantly frees any
      swallowed creatures, and it also supernaturally purges any poisons or
      toxins affecting the creature, even injury or inhaled ones, from the
      creature&rsquo;s body, ending any ongoing effects imposed by them. The
      creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. A creature may fail
      this save voluntarily.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">A creature that succeeds on its save does not vomit, but
      suffers a horrible wave of nausea. It is poisoned and rattled until the
      end of its next turn.</p>
