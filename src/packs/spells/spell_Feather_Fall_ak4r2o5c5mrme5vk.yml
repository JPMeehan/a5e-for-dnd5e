  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Magic slows the descent of each target. Until the spell ends, a
      target's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round. If a target lands
      before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its
      feet, ending the spell for that target.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When using a 2nd-level spell slot, targets can move
      horizontally 1 foot for every 1 foot they descend, effectively gliding
      through the air until they land or the spell ends.</p>
