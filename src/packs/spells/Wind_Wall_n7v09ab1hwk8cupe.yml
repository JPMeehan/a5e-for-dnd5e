  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose. You
      can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You
      can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one
      continuous path along the ground.</p><p>When the wall appears, each
      creature within its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 3d8
      bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.</p><p>The wall keeps fog, smoke, and other gases
      (including creatures in gaseous form) at bay. Small or smaller flying
      creatures or objects can't pass through. Loose, lightweight materials
      brought into the area fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary
      projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and
      automatically miss (larger projectiles such as boulders and siege engine
      attacks are unaffected).</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
      above 3rd.</p>
