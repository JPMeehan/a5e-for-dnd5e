      <p>You encase the target in a shell of ice.&nbsp;The ice has AC 13, 50 hit
      points; it is immune to cold damage and vulnerable to fire damage. Any
      cold damage that would be dealt to the ice instead heals it, up to its
      maximum hit points. A flying creature immediately falls to the ground,
      potentially dealing falling damage to the ice rather than the creature.
      Attacks directed at the target deal damage to the ice first; if the ice is
      reduced to 0 hp, any remaining damage transfers to the target.</p><p>If
      you maintain concentration for the full minute, the target is put into
      suspended animation indefinitely. &nbsp;A creature in suspended animation
      is unconscious, but no longer ages, and does not need to eat, drink, or
      breathe. A creature can willingly fail its saving throw. You can end this
      effect at will, even if you cast it upon yourself, and the creature
      awakens if the ice is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</strong> The ice has 20 additional hit points for every slot level
      above 5th.</p>
