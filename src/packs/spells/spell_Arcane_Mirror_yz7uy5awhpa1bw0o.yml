    value: >-
      <p>You choose a mirror you&rsquo;ve seen on the same plane of existence as
      you. You create a scrying sensor inside that mirror. You can instead name
      an area, such as a specific building or city: you create a scrying sensor
      inside a random mirror within that area. If there is no mirror in the
      area, the spell fails.</p><p>You can see and hear from the mirror as if
      you were within it. If there is at least one creature within sight of the
      mirror when you cast the spell, you can take control of that
      creature&rsquo;s reflection in the mirror. You can cause the reflection to
      act as you wish and to speak. Apart from the reflection&rsquo;s appearance
      in the mirror and the words it speaks, it has no effect on the real
      world.</p>
