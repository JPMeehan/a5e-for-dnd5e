    value: >-
      <p>You create an illusory image of a creature, object, or other visible
      effect within the area. The illusion is purely visual, it cannot produce
      sound or smell, and items and other creatures pass through it.</p><p>As an
      action, you can move the image to any point within range. The image's
      movement can be natural and lifelike (for example, a ball will roll and a
      bird will fly).</p><p>A creature can spend an action to make an
      Investigation check against your spell save DC to determine if the image
      is an illusion. On a success, it is able to see through the image.</p>
