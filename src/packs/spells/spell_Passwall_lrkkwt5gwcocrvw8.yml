  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, you create a passage extending into the target
      surface. When creating the passage you define its dimensions, as long as
      they do not exceed 5 feet in width, 8 feet in height, or 20 feet in
      depth.</p><p>The appearance of the passage has no effect on the stability
      of the surrounding environment.</p><p>Any creatures or objects within the
      passage when the spell ends are expelled without harm into unoccupied
      spaces near where the spell was cast.</p>
