    value: >-
      <p>You create a shadowy door on the target. The door is large enough for
      Medium creatures to pass through. The door leads to a demiplane that
      appears as an empty, 30-foot-cube chamber made of wood or stone. When the
      spell ends, the door disappears from both sides, trapping any creatures or
      objects inside the demiplane.</p><p>Each time you cast this spell, you can
      either create a new demiplane, conjure the door to a demiplane you have
      previously created, or make a door leading to a demiplane whose nature or
      contents you are familiar with.</p>
