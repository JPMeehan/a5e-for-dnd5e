  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You use magic to mold yourself into a new form. Choose one of the
      options below. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to choose a
      different option.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Amphibian:</strong> Your body
      takes on aquatic adaptations. You can breathe underwater normally and gain
      a swimming speed equal to your base Speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Altered
      State:</strong> You decide what you look like.<br><br>None of your
      gameplay statistics change but you can alter anything about your body's
      appearance, including but not limited to: your heritage, 1 foot of height,
      weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, sound of your
      voice, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex, and any other
      distinguishing features. You cannot become a creature of a different size
      category, and your limb structure remains the same; for example if you're
      bipedal, you can't use this spell to become a quadruped. Until the spell
      ends, you can use an action to change your
      appearance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Red in Tooth and Claw:</strong> You
      grow magical natural weapons of your choice with a +1 bonus to attack and
      damage. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
      damage of a type determined by the natural weapon you chose; for example a
      tentacle deals bludgeoning, a horn deals piercing, and claws deal
      slashing.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When using a spell slot of 5th-level, add the
      following to the list of forms you can
      adopt.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Greater Natural Weapons:</strong> The damage
      dealt by your natural weapon increases to 2d6, and you gain a +2 bonus to
      attack and damage rolls with your natural
      weapons.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mask of the Grave:</strong> You adopt the
      appearance of a skeleton or zombie (your choice). Your type changes to
      undead, and mindless undead creatures ignore your presence, treating you
      as one of their own. You don't need to breathe and you become immune to
      poison.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wings:</strong> A pair of wings sprouts
      from your back. The wings can appear bird-like, leathery like a bat or
      dragon's wings, or like the wings of an insect. You gain a fly speed equal
      to your base Speed.</p><p></p></li></ul>
