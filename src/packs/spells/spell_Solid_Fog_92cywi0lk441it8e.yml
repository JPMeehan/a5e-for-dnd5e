  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an area of fog, but unlike regular fog this fog is thick and
      nearly solid. The area is heavily obscured. Creatures attempting to move
      through it have their speeds reduced to 5 feet. All melee attack rolls are
      made at disadvantage within the fog, and melee damage rolls are halved.
      The fog blocks ranged weapon attacks. If a creature falls into the fog,
      its falling damage is halved. Creatures cannot sprint through the fog. The
      solid fog spreads around corners, but can only be dispersed by a strong
      wind (at least 20 miles per hour).</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</strong> The spell&rsquo;s radius increases by 20 feet for every
      slot level above 4th.</p>
