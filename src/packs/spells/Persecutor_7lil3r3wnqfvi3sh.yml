    value: >-
      <p>You do not just know your studied adversaries, you hate them, and that
      hatred manifests in terrible wrath against your chosen foe.</p><p>When you
      cast this spell, choose a single adversary or humanoid heritage that is
      currently your Studied Adversary. For the duration of the spell, you have
      advantage on Intimidate checks against this adversary or
      heritage.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels. </strong>For each spell
      slot above first, your attacks against the selected adversary or heritage
      deal an additional 1d4 points of necrotic damage. If you cast this spell
      with a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, a creature that takes this
      additional damage also cannot regain hit points until the start of your
      next turn.</p>
