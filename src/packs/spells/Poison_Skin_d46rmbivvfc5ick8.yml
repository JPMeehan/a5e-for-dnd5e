  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target becomes poisonous to the touch. Until the spell ends,
      whenever a creature within 5 feet of the target damages the target with a
      melee weapon attack, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failed save, the creature becomes poisoned and takes 1d6 ongoing poison
      damage.</p><p>A poisoned creature can make a Constitution saving throw at
      the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p><p>The target of the spell also becomes bright and
      multicolored like a poisonous dart frog, giving it disadvantage on
      Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The target's skin is also covered in mucus, giving
      it advantage on saving throws and checks made to resist being grappled or
      restrained. In addition, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
      above 3rd.</p>
