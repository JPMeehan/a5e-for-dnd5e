      <p>Until the spell ends, the target can walk on air as if it were solid
      ground. The target can move upward or downward at a maximum angle of 45
      degrees, at half its speed upwards (like walking up a steep hill) or twice
      its speed downward.</p><p>A strong wind can push the target. At the end of
      each of the target&rsquo;s turn, the target is pushed 5 feet for each 5
      miles per hour of wind speed. Especially violent or turbulent winds are
      considered difficult terrain. When the duration ends, the target falls as
      if affected by a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ak4r2o5c5mrme5vk]{Feather Fall}
      spell.</p><p>You can train a mount to be ridden through the air with
      castings of this spell. It requires daily casting and training, with one
      week of work and a DC 20 Animal Handling check. Retries are allowed, but
      require additional time and work.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</strong> Target one additional creature for each slot level above
      5th.</p>
