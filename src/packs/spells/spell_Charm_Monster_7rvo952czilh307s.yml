      <p>You only require line of sight to the target (not line of effect) and
      it has advantage on its saving throw to resist the spell if you or your
      companions are fighting it. Until the spell ends, the target is charmed by
      you and friendly towards you.</p><p>The spell ends if you or your
      companions do anything harmful towards the target. The target knows it was
      charmed by you when the spell ends.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level above 4th, you affect one
      additional target that is within 30 feet of other targets.</p>
