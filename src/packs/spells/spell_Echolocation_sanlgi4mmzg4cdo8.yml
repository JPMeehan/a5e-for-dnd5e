      <p>You gain hearing so fine, it is as though you can see. The power of
      this spell simulates your environment inside your mind, based on the
      sounds that reach you&mdash;including those reflected off nearby surfaces.
      For the duration of the spell, you gain Blindsight (120 feet), and you
      gain advantage and an expertise die on Perception checks you make based on
      sound. This spell also permits you to hear supersonic frequencies within
      range. This spell ends early if you become deafened. Because this spell is
      reliant on sound, your Blindsight is blocked by objects and effects that
      block sound&mdash;such as soundproof glass and the silence spell. Your
      Blindsight does not detect creatures and objects with no physical
      presence, &mdash;such as spell effects, and creatures on the Ethereal
      Plane&mdash;but you do become aware of any sounds they emit.</p>
