  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light.</p><p>When a
      creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn
      in the area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving
      throw, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
      success.</p><p>Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a
      failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while
      within the spell's light.</p><p>On your turn, you may use an action to
      move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
      above 2nd.</p>
