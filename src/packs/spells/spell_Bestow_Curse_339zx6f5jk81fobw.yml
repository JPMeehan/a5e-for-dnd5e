    value: >-
      <p>Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li>Select one ability score; the
      target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws using that
      ability score.</li><li>The target makes attack rolls against you with
      disadvantage.</li><li>Each turn, the target loses its action unless it
      succeeds a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn.</li><li>Your
      attacks and spells deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage against the
      target.</li></ul><p>A curse lasts until the spell ends. At the Narrator's
      discretion you may create a different curse effect with this spell so long
      as it is weaker than the options above.</p><p>A <em>remove curse</em>
      spell ends the effect if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or
      greater than the spell slot used to cast <em>bestow
      curse</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When
      using a 4th-level spell slot the duration increases to 10 minutes. When
      using a 5th-level spell slot the duration increases to 8 hours and it no
      longer requires your concentration. When using a 7th-level spell slot the
      duration is 24 hours.</p>
