      <p>You create up to four hovering lights which appear as torches,
      lanterns, or glowing orbs that can be combined into a glowing Medium-sized
      humanoid form. Each sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p><p>You can use
      a bonus action to move the lights up to 60 feet so long as each remains
      within 20 feet of another light created by this spell. A dancing light
      winks out when it exceeds the spell's range.</p>
