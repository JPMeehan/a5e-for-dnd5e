      <p dir="ltr">You channel arcane power to enhance your knowledge of
      technology. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following two
      options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You learn how a mechanical device you can
      touch works, what would be necessary (in terms of materials, tools, and
      training) to make more copies of it, and if it is broken, how to repair
      it.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can &ldquo;overclock&rdquo; the
      technology for a minute. If it&rsquo;s a vehicle, its speed increases by
      25%. If it&rsquo;s a structure, it can bear an additional 25% of weight.
      If it&rsquo;s a protective item, it provides an additional +1 to AC (if
      applicable). If it deals damage, the damage increases by 1d10. Additional
      enhancements may be available at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
