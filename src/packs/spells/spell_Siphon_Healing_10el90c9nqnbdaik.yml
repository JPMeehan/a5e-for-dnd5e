    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You siphon healing from one creature and give it
      to&nbsp;another.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Cast this spell on a creature in response to it healing
      via&nbsp;any source. The target must make a saving throw against&nbsp;your
      spell save DC. On a failed save, you may reduce the&nbsp;hit points healed
      from that source by as little as one point&nbsp;or as much as the full
      amount that would be healed.&nbsp;Another creature within range then heals
      the reduced&nbsp;amount. In the case on an ongoing effect such
      as&nbsp;regeneration, the spell only affects the instance it was
      cast&nbsp;in response to, not prior or future instances. The spell
      then&nbsp;ends.</p>
