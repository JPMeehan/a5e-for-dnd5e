  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A roiling cloud of insects appears, biting and stinging any creatures
      it touches. The cloud lightly obscures its area, spreads around corners,
      and is considered difficult terrain. When the cloud appears and a creature
      is in it, when a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn,
      or when a creature ends its turn within the cloud it makes a Constitution
      saving throw, taking 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as
      much on a successful one.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
      above 5th.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Infernal
      Insect Plague. </strong>The spell summons hellish insects from the depths
      of the realms infernal. When a creature fails its saving throw against
      this spell it becomes frightened of the swarm until the spell ends, even
      after it leaves the cloud.</p>
