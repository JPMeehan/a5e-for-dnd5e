    value: >-
      <p>You inscribe a message onto the target and wrap it in illusion until
      the spell ends. You and any creatures that you designate when the spell is
      cast perceive the message as normal. You may choose to have other
      creatures view the message as writing in an unknown or unintelligible
      magical script or a different message. If you choose to create another
      message, you can change the handwriting and the language that the message
      is written in, though you must know the language in question.</p><p>If the
      spell is dispelled, both the message and its illusory mask
      disappear.</p><p>The true message can be perceived by any creature with
      truesight.</p>
