    value: >-
      <p>You disappear in a burst of burning brimstone and teleport to an
      unoccupied space that you can see within range. An explosion of fire and
      smoke, and the scent of burning brimstone, accompanies your exit and
      entrance, targeting all creatures adjacent to you at the point you left
      and the point you appear. Target creatures in those areas must make
      Dexterity saving throws, taking 3d6 damage on a failure or half on a
      success. The areas are also filled with obscuring smoke for 1 round, which
      dissipates at the end of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels</strong>. The fire damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level
      above 4th.</p>
