    value: >-
      <p>A Medium or smaller object becomes invisible, as do any inanimate
      contents inside it when the spell is cast. Objects removed from the
      spell&rsquo;s original target become visible. Objects placed in or on the
      target after the spell is cast remain visible, and dirt, dust, and other
      markings may reveal the invisible object&rsquo;s location. The spell ends
      if the object deals damage.</p>

      <p>Attacks made with an invisible melee weapon are made with
      advantage.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels</em>: </strong>When cast with a
      5th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 day. When cast with a 7th-level
      spell slot, the duration is permanent until dispelled.</p>
