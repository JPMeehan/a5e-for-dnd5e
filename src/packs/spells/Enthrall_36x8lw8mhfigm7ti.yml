      <p>You weave a compelling stream of words that captivates your targets.
      Any target that can't be charmed automatically succeeds on its saving
      throw, and targets fighting you or creatures friendly to you have
      advantage on the saving throw.</p><p>Until the spell ends or a target can
      no longer hear you, it has disadvantage on Perception checks made to
      perceive any creature other than you. The spell ends if you are
      incapacitated or can no longer speak.</p>
