      <p>You touch the target and mark it with a glyph that acts as a scrying
      sensor. The glyph is visible and resembles a one-inch-tall drawing of an
      ear. The sensor can be covered or concealed without changing the function
      of the spell. A creature can wipe it away as an action, ending the spell.
      You can only have one such sensor active at once.</p>

      <p>While the sensor is active, you can use a bonus action to hear both
      through the sensor as though you were at its location and through your
      normal senses. This effect lasts until you end the spell as an action, use
      a bonus action to silence it (doing so does not end the spell), or the
      duration ends. While hearing through the sensor you have&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">disadvantage</span>&nbsp;on Perception checks to
      observe your surroundings, but not to those made to detect noises through
      the sensor. Additionally, you can hear through this sensor even if you
      are&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">deafened</span>&nbsp;. Creatures
      cannot hear you through the sensor.</p>
