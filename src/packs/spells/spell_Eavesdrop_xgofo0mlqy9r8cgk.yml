    value: >-
      <p>You touch the target and mark it with a glyph that acts as a scrying
      sensor. The glyph is visible and resembles a one-inch-tall drawing of an
      ear. The sensor can be covered or concealed without changing the function
      of the spell. A creature can wipe it away as an action, ending the spell.
      You can only have one such sensor active at once.</p><p>While the sensor
      is active, you can use a bonus action to hear both through the sensor as
      though you were at its location and through your normal senses. This
      effect lasts until you end the spell as an action, use a bonus action to
      silence it (doing so does not end the spell), or the duration ends. While
      hearing through the sensor you have&nbsp;disadvantage</span>&nbsp;on
      Perception checks to observe your surroundings, but not to those made to
      detect noises through the sensor. Additionally, you can hear through this
      sensor even if you are&nbsp;deafened&nbsp;. Creatures cannot hear you
      through the sensor.</p></div></div><div><div><em><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels. </strong></em><span>When cast using a 7th-level spell slot, the
      spell&rsquo;s duration increases to 30 days. When cast using a 9th-level
      spell slot, the spell&rsquo;s duration is permanent.
