      an&nbsp;almost total understanding of a creature or
      object&rsquo;s&nbsp;defenses and body language. The duration
      increases&nbsp;to Concentration (1 minute) and you gain advantage&nbsp;to
      three additional attack rolls of your choice&nbsp;that are made before the

      when&nbsp;you make your first attack roll on your turn.</p>
