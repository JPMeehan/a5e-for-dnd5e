  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You employ sheer force of will to make reality question the existence
      of a nearby creature, causing them to warp visibly in front of
      you.</p><p>Until the spell ends, a target native to your current plane is
      banished to a harmless demiplane and incapacitated. At the end of the
      duration the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest
      unoccupied space). A target native to a different plane is instead
      banished to its native plane.</p><p>At the end of each of its turns, a
      banished creature can repeat the saving throw with a -1 penalty for each
      round it has spent banished, returning on a success. If the spell ends
      before its maximum duration, the target reappears in the space it left (or
      the nearest unoccupied space) but otherwise a target native to a different
      plane doesn't return.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The duration of banishment increases by 1 round for
      each slot level above 4th.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Icy Displeasure. </strong>Until the spell ends,
      the target is vulnerable to cold damage and it has disadvantage on ability
      checks and attack rolls.</p>
