  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to sense the presence of otherworldly forces. You
      automatically know if there is a place or object within range that has
      been magically consecrated or desecrated. In addition, on the round you
      cast it and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you may
      make a Wisdom (Religion) check against the passive Deception score of any
      aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creature within
      range. On a success, you sense the creature's presence, as well as where
      the creature is located.</p><p>The spell penetrates most barriers but is
      blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
      metal, or a thin sheet of lead.</p>
