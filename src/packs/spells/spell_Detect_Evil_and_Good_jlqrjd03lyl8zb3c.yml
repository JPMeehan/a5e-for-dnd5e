      <p>You automatically know if there is a place or object within range that
      has been magically consecrated or desecrated. In addition, on the round
      you cast it and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you
      may make a Wisdom (Religion) check against the passive Deception score of
      any aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creature
      within range. On a success, you sense the creature's presence, as well as
      where the creature is located.</p>

      <p>The spell penetrates most barriers but is blocked by 3 feet of wood or
      dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of
      lead.</p>
