      <p><strong>Classes:&nbsp;</strong>Warlock, Wizard</p>

      <p>You summon a powerful demon from the teeming hordes of the Abyss. The
      creature has the statistics of a <em>Demonic Hordeling</em>, with certain
      traits determined by its type, as detailed in its <strong><em>Varied
      Shapes</em></strong> trait.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn
      immediately after yours.</p>

      <p>It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only
      defends itself.</p>

      <p>Demons are unruly and difficult to control at the best of times. If you
      attempt to give it a command to do anything other than move to and attack
      another creature it can reach this round, or dash towards a creature to
      attack it if none are within range, you must make a spellcasting ability
      check opposed by the creatures charisma check as part of your command. On
      a success it obeys you, on a failure it attacks the nearest creature or
      dashes towards the nearest creature if it cannot reach one to attack. Once
      it attacks a creature, it will continue to do without need for further
      orders, and any attempt to get it to do anything else, including attacking
      a different creature, requires another opposed check.</p>

      <p>The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your
      concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the
      creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions.
      An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When cast with a 6th
      or higher level spell slot, roll on the varied traits table twice. The
      <em>demonic hordeling</em> has both rolled abilities. The <em>demonic
      hordeling</em> also gets an expertise die on its opposed charisma checks
      when you try to give it commands.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><strong>Rare: Elmeriko's Chaotic Conjure Horde Demon. </strong>The
      spell does not require concentration, but the <em>demonic hordeling</em>
      summoned gains an expertise die on any opposed checks to resist your
      control.</p>
