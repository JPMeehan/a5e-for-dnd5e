  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Magical darkness heavily obscures darkvision and blocks nonmagical
      light in the area. The darkness spreads around corners. If any of the area
      overlaps with magical light created by a spell of 2nd-level or lower, the
      spell that created the light is dispelled.</p><p>When cast on an object
      that is in your possession or unattended, the darkness emanates from it
      and moves with it. Completely covering the object with something that is
      not transparent blocks the darkness.</p>
