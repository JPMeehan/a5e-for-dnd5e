      <p dir="ltr">A glowing mark appears on the target. While the spell is
      active, you deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage to the target whenever
      you hit it with a melee weapon attack, you have advantage on
      Investigation, Perception, and Survival checks you make to track or locate
      it, and it has disadvantage on checks to escape from your grapples or
      restraints you place on it.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels. </strong>If you cast this
      spell using a slot of at least 4th level, the duration increases to 24
      hours. If you cast it with a slot of at least 6th level, the duration
      increases to a week. If you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is
      permanent and you know if the target moves to a different plane.</p>
