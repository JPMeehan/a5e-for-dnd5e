  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is banished to a complex maze on its own demiplane, and
      remains there for the duration or until the target succeeds in
      escaping.</p><p>The target can use an action to attempt to escape, making
      an Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save it escapes and the
      spell ends. A creature with Labyrinthine Recall (or a similar trait)
      automatically succeeds on its save.</p><p>When the spell ends the target
      reappears in the space it occupied before the spell was cast, or the
      closest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>
