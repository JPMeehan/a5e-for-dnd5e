  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You magically hide away a willing creature or object. The target
      becomes invisible, and it cannot be traced or detected by divination or
      scrying sensors. If the target is a living creature, it falls into a state
      of suspended animation and stops aging.</p><p>The spell ends when the
      target takes damage or a condition you set occurs. The condition can be
      anything you choose, like a set amount of time or a specific event, but it
      must occur within or be visible within 1 mile of the target.</p>
