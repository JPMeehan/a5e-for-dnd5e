      <p dir="ltr">Holding a small doll or figure that you created to resemble
      your target, you strike at it, put it into danger, or otherwise do harm
      which translates from the effigy to your target. As an action on each of
      your turns, and as part of the action casting this spell, you may choose
      one of the following options.</p><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Break: </strong>By snapping a limb of the
      doll, you cause intense pain in your target. The target takes 3d8 + Int
      modifier necrotic damage. If you break an arm, the creature takes
      disadvantage on attack rolls during the remaining duration. If you break a
      leg the target&rsquo;s movement speed is halved. You may only attempt to
      use this action once per limb the target possesses.</p><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Control: </strong>By sharply turning the doll
      in your hand, you force the target of your spell to lash out, making a
      weapon attack against a target of your choosing with any weapon the
      creature has readied.</p><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Drown:
      </strong>If you have access to water you may dunk your figurine in water.
      This forces your target to hold their breath or begin drowning. However
      this action also causes the target to be capable of swimming through the
      air until the effigy is removed from the water.</p><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Fling: </strong>By throwing your effigy, you
      also throw your target up to 60ft in a direction of your choosing,
      including upward. If you fling the effigy into a solid object, your target
      takes falling damage as if they had fallen 60ft.</p><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Jerk: </strong>By jerking the effigy sharply
      you cause your target to move, jerkily and as if not under their own
      control, up to half their movement rate.</p><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Slam:</strong> By slamming the doll against a
      solid surface, such as a table or the ground, you can force your target to
      become prone. If they attempt to get up on their turn, they must make a
      charisma save or waste half their movement doing so.</p><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Stab: </strong>Using a hatpin, dagger, or
      other sharp implement, you may stab the doll, dealing between 1d8 + Int
      modifier and 3d8 + Int modifier piercing or necrotic damage to your
      target. You may choose to do more or less damage by aiming for more or
      less sensitive parts of the effigy.</p><p dir="ltr">The creature may make
      charisma saving throws against any action you attempt to force them to
      perform. If you have created this effigy by spending ten minutes of
      preparation using an item owned by or body part (such as hair or
      fingernails) of your target, they have disadvantage on a charisma save to
      resist any of the individual effects. The spell can be ended early with
      remove curse or similar magic. If you created an effigy using the create
      likeness spell, the target makes their saves normally.The spell does not
      end on a successful save, but the effect does not take hold.</p>
