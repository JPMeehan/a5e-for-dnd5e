  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell ends a curse inflicted with a spell slot of 3rd-level or
      lower. If the curse was instead inflicted by a feature or trait, the spell
      ends a curse inflicted by a creature of Challenge Rating 6 or lower. If
      cast on a cursed object of Rare or lesser rarity, this spell breaks the
      owner's attunement to the item (although it does not end the curse on the
      object).</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each
      slot level above 3rd, the spell ends a curse inflicted either by a spell
      one level higher or by a creature with a Challenge Rating two higher. When
      using a 6th-level spell slot, the spell breaks the owner's attunement to a
      Very Rare item.</p><p>When using a 9th-level spell slot, the spell breaks
      the owner's attunement to a Legendary item.</p>
