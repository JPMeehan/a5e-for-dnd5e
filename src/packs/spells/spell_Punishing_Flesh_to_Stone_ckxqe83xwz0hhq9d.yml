  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target becomes restrained as it begins to turn to stone. On a
      successful saving throw, the target is instead slowed until the end of its
      next turn and the spell ends.</p><p>A creature restrained by this spell
      makes a second saving throw at the end of its turn. On a success, the
      spell ends. On a failure, the target is petrified for the duration. If you
      maintain concentration for the maximum duration of the spell, this
      petrification is permanent.</p><p>Any pieces removed from a petrified
      creature are missing when the petrification ends.</p><p><strong><em>Cast
      at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Target one additional creature when you
      cast this spell with an 8th-level spell slot.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Punishing Flesh to Stone.</strong> When you
      permanently petrify a target, you can designate a trigger event within 60
      feet of the statue which causes the petrification to end. Example trigger
      events include a creature touching the statue or a specific item, or a
      word or phrase being spoken.</p>
