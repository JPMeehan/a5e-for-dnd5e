      <p>You perform a religious ceremony during the casting time of this spell.
      When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following effects, any
      targets of which must be within range during the entire
      casting.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Funeral:</strong> You bless one or more
      corpses, acknowledging their transition away from this world. For the next
      week, they cannot become undead by any means short of a wish spell. This
      benefit lasts indefinitely regarding undead of CR 1/4 or less. A corpse
      can only benefit from this effect once.</p></li><li><p><strong>Guide the
      Passing:</strong> You bless one or more creatures within range for their
      passage into the next life. For the next 7 days, their souls cannot be
      trapped or captured by any means short of a wish spell. Once a creature
      benefits from this effect, it can't do so again until it has been restored
      to life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Offering:</strong> The gifts of the
      faithful are offered to the benefit of the gods and the community. Choose
      one skill or tool proficiency and target a number of creatures equal to
      your proficiency bonus that are within range. When a target makes an
      ability check using the skill or tool within the next week, it can choose
      to use this benefit to gain an expertise die on the check. A creature can
      be targeted by this effect no more than once per
      week.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purification:</strong> A creature you touch
      is washed with your spiritual energy. Choose one disease or possession
      effect on the target. If the save DC for that effect is equal to or lower
      than your spell save DC, the effect ends.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rite of
      Passage:</strong> You shepherd one or more creatures into the next phase
      of life, such as in a child dedication, coming of age, marriage, or
      conversion ceremony. These creatures gain inspiration. A creature can
      benefit from this effect no more than once per year.</p></li></ul>
