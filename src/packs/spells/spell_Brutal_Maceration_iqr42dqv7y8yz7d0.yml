    value: >-
      <p>You magically target the internal fluids of a creature, causing them to
      turn caustic and begin to melt the flesh from their bones. The target
      creature must make a Constitution saving throw versus your spell save DC.
      On a failure, the target takes 10d8+30 acid damage. The target may repeat
      the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a success, the
      spell ends. On each successive failure, the creature takes an additional
      4d8 acid damage. If the creature fails its saving throw three times in a
      row, or if it is reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this spell, it
      dies as its flesh is completely dissolved and it collapses into a heap of
      bones.</p>
