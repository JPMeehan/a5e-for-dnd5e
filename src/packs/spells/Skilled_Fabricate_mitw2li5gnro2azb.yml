      you cast the spell, select raw materials you can see within range. From
      them, the spell fabricates a Large or smaller object (contained within a
      single 10-foot cube or up to eight connected 5-foot cubes) given a
      sufficient quantity of raw material. When fabricating with metal, stone,
      or another mineral substance, the fabricated object can be no larger than
      Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of any objects
