      <p dir="ltr">As you crush the lung in the palm of your hand, your target
      feels as if they are drowning on dry land. The target must hold their
      breath or begin drowning. If they take damage they must make a
      concentration check to hold their breath. Creatures that do not breathe
      are immune to this spell.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Creatures that die from the effects of this spell have water
      filling their lungs and throat.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> For every level above
      4th, you may choose an additional target.</p>
