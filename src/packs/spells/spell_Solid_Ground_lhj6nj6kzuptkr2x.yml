  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You magically shore up and smooth the ground. Any non-magical difficult
      terrain in the spell&rsquo;s area ceases to be difficult terrain; mud
      dries, uneven ground flattens, vegetation withers away, ice melts,
      slippery liquids like oil absorb or dissipate, etc. In addition, if any
      horizontal surfaces in the area look solid but cannot actually bear the
      weight of a normal medium-sized or smaller creature, they are magically
      reinforced making them safe to walk across for the next hour. This spell
      even solidifies pressure plates and trap doors, keeping them from
      activating for the next hour without deliberate effort. (For example, you
      could open a trap door that opens in by grasping the handle and opening
      it, but not by stepping on it.)</p>
