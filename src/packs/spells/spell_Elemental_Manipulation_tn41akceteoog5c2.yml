      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Target:</strong> A section of the chosen element no
      larger than a 5-foot cube&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When you cast this spell,
      choose one of the four classical elements, air, earth, fire, or
      water.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">If you chose air, then choose one of the
      following options:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can create a quick gust of wind. This is enough to
      blow papers around, cause wind chimes to jingle, ruffle hair, or
      extinguish a candle flame, but not put out a torch or larger fire or to
      move objects of any significant weight.</p></li><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can create a bubble of
      air in a body of liquid. The air is enough to allow a medium-sized
      creature to breathe for one round and persists for an hour or until used
      somehow (such as being inhaled by a creature), before dissipating into the
      surrounding liquid.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can create a thin swirl of colored smoke. The
      smoke can be any color you wish, but does not interfere with vision or
      breathing.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can remove or create smells in a 5&rsquo; cube of
      air within range.</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you chose earth, then
      choose one of the following options:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can turn a fist-sized
      clump of dirt, sand, or clay into an equally-sized clump of dirt, sand, or
      clay.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can form a cubic foot or dirt, sand, or clay into
      a different shape. The earth holds its shape until disturbed or until the
      duration expires, at which point it crumbles, unless it could hold the
      shape normally. (You could make a vase out of clay and it would hold its
      shape, but a vase made of sand would crumble.)</p></li><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can create up to 25
      fist-shaped holes (suitable for planting seeds) in a 5&rsquo; x 5&rsquo;
      section of dirt, clay, or sand, creating a small pile of displaced earth
      near each hole.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can dry a 5&rsquo; x 5&rsquo; section of dirt or
      clay to the point where it hardens or soften it into mud that will leave
      messy footprints when walked through.</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you
      chose fire, then choose one of the following options:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can change the color
      of an existing flame for an hour. This does not change the flame&rsquo;s
      temperature or how much light it provides.</p></li><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can scoop a section of
      flame from an existing fire into your hands and deposit it on another
      flammable object or surface within 5 feet without burning
      yourself.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can extinguish a fire up to the size of a normal
      campfire.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can create colorful showers of sparks similar to a
      sparkler.</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you chose water, then choose one of
      the following options:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can cause up to a 5&rsquo; cube of water you can
      see to flow as you direct. The water can only be moved inside the radius
      of the spell and does not move quickly enough to cause damage or move
      creatures, but can douse flames, be sprinkled over a garden,
      etc.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can freeze the water as long as it is not occupied
      by any creatures. The water thaws and becomes liquid again after an
      hour.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can change the color of the water or make it
      cloudy. This affects the entire mass of the water uniformly. It reverts to
      its original traits after an hour.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p
      dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can cause the water to evaporate,
      creating a thin fog that does not obscure vision and a feeling of
      humidity.</p></li></ul>
