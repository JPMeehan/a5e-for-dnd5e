  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear in your space. For the
      duration, these copies move with you and mimic your actions, creating
      confusion as to which is real.&nbsp;You can use an action to dismiss
      them.</p>

      <p>Each time you're targeted by a creature's attack, roll a d20 to see if
      it targets you or one of your copies.</p>

      <p>With 3 copies, a roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted. With two
      copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11
      or higher targets the copy.</p>

      <p>A copy's AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and when it is hit by an
      attack a copy is destroyed.&nbsp;It may be destroyed only by an attack
      that hits it.&nbsp;All other damage and effects have no impact.</p>

      <p>Attacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have blindsight,
      or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a 5th-level
      spell slot, the duration increases to concentration (1 hour).</p>
