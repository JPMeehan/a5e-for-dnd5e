      <p>You imagine a creature you can see within range in a deconstructed and
      simplified form. The target must make a Charisma saving throw . On a
      failed save, the target becomes a barely recognizable, abstracted version
      of itself until the spell ends.</p>

      <p>An abstracted creature&rsquo;s speed is halved, it takes a &minus;2
      penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can&rsquo;t use
      reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not
      both. Regardless of the creature&rsquo;s abilities or magic items, it
      can&rsquo;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>

      <p>At the end of each of its turns, an abstracted target repeats the
      saving throw to end the spell&rsquo;s effect on it.</p>

      <p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.&nbsp;</strong>You can choose one
      additional target for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
