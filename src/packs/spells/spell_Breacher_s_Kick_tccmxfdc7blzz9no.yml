    value: >-
      <p>You magically bolster your ability to kick through obstacles. The next
      unarmed strike you make against an inanimate object after casting this
      spell deals an additional 6d6 points of force damage (this spell has no
      effect on attacks made against creatures). If this reduces the object to 0
      hit points, a blast of shrapnel fills the spell area. Creatures caught in
      the blast must make a Dexterity saving throw, suffering 3d8 points of
      piercing damage. A creature that succeeds on its save takes half
      damage.</p>
