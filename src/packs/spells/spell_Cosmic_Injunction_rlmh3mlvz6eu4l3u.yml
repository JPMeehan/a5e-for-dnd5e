    value: >-
      <p>You forbid a creature to take a specific action until the end of its
      next turn. Valid choices are melee attacks, ranged attacks, casting
      spells, or a specific, known action particular to the creature such as a
      dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon. If the creature can perform the prohibited
      action with a bonus action, reaction, or legendary action, the
      spell&rsquo;s effects apply to those as well. The creature is aware of
      your prohibition and the potential consequences for disobeying it
      regardless of any language barriers between you and it.</p><p>On its next
      turn, if the creature decides to defy your forbiddance and perform the
      action anyway, it must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell
      save DC. On a success, it suffers no ill effects and can perform the
      action as normal. On a failure, it can perform the action as normal, but
      if it does, it suffers 4d8 points of psychic damage and is slowed until
      the end of its next turn.</p>
