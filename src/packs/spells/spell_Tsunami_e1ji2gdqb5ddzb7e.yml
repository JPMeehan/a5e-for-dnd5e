    value: >-
      <p>You create a giant wave of water, up to 300 feet wide, 300 feet high,
      and 50 feet thick at a point within range that you can see. When you cast
      the spell, each creature within the area must make a Strength saving
      throw, taking 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half on a
      successful save. The wall can appear in any orientation you choose within
      range.</p><p>At the start of your turn the round after you cast it, choose
      a direction; the wave begins to move 50 feet in that direction at the
      start of each of your turns, carrying any creatures inside the wall with
      it. You must spend an action sustaining the spell each round. After
      moving, each creature within the wall, and any new creatures whose space
      the wave enters, must make a Strength saving throw against the
      spell&rsquo;s damage. Each round, the wave&rsquo;s height is reduced by 50
      feet and its damage is reduced by 1d6. The spell ends when the
      wave&rsquo;s height is reduced to 0.</p><p>Creatures in the wall&rsquo;s
      space can move by swimming, requiring Athletics checks against your spell
      DC to move. Colossal or larger creatures get advantage on their saves and
      checks to resist damage and to swim in the wave.</p><p>Structures in the
      path take double damage from the wave.</p>
