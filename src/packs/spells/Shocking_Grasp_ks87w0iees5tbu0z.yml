  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Electricity arcs from your hand to shock the target. Make a melee spell
      attack (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal). On a
      hit, you deal 1d8 lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions
      until the start of its next turn as the electricity courses through its
      body.</p><p>This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level
      (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
