  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a nontransparent barrier of prismatic energy that sheds
      bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for an additional 100
      feet. You and creatures you choose at the time of casting are immune to
      the barrier's effects and may pass through it at will.</p><p>The barrier
      can be created as either a vertical wall or a sphere. If the wall
      intersects a space occupied by a creature the spell fails, you lose your
      action, and the spell slot is wasted.</p><p>When a creature that can see
      the barrier moves within 20 feet of the area or starts its turn within 20
      feet of the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or it is blinded
      for 1 minute.</p><p>The wall has 7 layers, each layer of a different color
      in order from red to violet. Once a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the
      duration of the spell.</p><p>To pass or reach through the barrier a
      creature does so one layer at a time and must make a Dexterity saving
      throw for each layer or be subjected to that layer's effects. On a
      successful save, any damage taken from a layer is reduced by half.</p><p>A
      rod of cancellation can destroy a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field
      has no effect.</p><p>Red: The creature takes 10d6 fire damage.</p><p>While
      active, nonmagical ranged attacks can't penetrate the barrier. The layer
      is destroyed by 25 cold damage.</p><p>Orange: The creature takes 10d6 acid
      damage. While active, magical ranged attacks can't penetrate the barrier.
      The layer is destroyed by strong winds.</p><p>Yellow: The creature takes
      10d6 lightning damage. This layer is destroyed by 60 force
      damage.</p><p>Green: The creature takes 10d6 poison damage. A passwall
      spell, or any spell of equal or greater level which can create a portal on
      a solid surface, destroys the layer.</p><p>Blue: The creature takes 10d6
      cold damage.</p><p>This layer is destroyed by 25 fire
      damage.</p><p>Indigo: The creature is restrained and makes a Constitution
      saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Once it accumulates three
      failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it accumulates three
      successful saves the effect ends. This layer can be destroyed by bright
      light, such as that created by the daylight spell or a spell of equal or
      greater level.</p><p>Violet: The creature is blinded. At the start of your
      next turn, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on
      a success.</p><p>On a failed save, the creature is banished to another
      random plane and is no longer blind. If it originated from another plane
      it returns there, while other creatures are generally cast into the Astral
      Plane or Ethereal Plane. This layer can be destroyed by dispel magic or a
      similar spell of equal or greater level capable of ending spells or
      magical effects.</p>
