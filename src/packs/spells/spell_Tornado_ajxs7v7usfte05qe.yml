    value: >-
      <p>You create a powerful tornado of swirling wind. It is 10 feet wide at
      its base, 40 feet wide at its top, and 40 feet tall. If a creature comes
      in contact with the whirlwind, it must make a Dexterity saving throw, or
      take 8d8 bludgeoning damage and be lifted into the tornado. On a
      successful save the target takes half damage and is not lifted; huge or
      larger creatures cannot be lifted. A lifted creature is restrained in the
      tornado and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage at the end of each of their
      turns. At the start of each of a restrained creature&rsquo;s turns, it is
      lifted 5 feet higher into the tornado, unless it is already at the top.
      Restrained creatures move with the tornado.</p><p>On your turn, you can
      move the tornado up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. It sucks
      up any medium or smaller unsecured objects, snuffs out any small
      unprotected fires, and spreads large fires.</p><p>A restrained creature
      can use an action to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check against your
      spell save DC to escape the tornado. If successful, it is ejected from the
      tornado in a random direction; roll a d8 to determine direction away from
      the tornado. The creature falls a number of feet away equal to 1d12 x 5 ft
      (unless it can fly).</p>
