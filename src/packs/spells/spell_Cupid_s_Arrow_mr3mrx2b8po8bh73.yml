      <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, make a ranged weapon
      attack against a target within range of the weapon you are wielding. If
      you hit, the target takes no damage, is instead healed for an amount of
      hit points equal to the weaponâ€™s normal damage + 1d8, and must make a
      Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails
      its save is charmed by you for one minute. A creature that succeeds on its
      save is still healed, but is not charmed.</p><p>The spell ends if you or
      your companions do anything harmful towards the target. The target knows
      it was charmed by you when the spell ends.&nbsp;</p><p>If the target is
      already friendly toward you, it is not charmed and instead gains an
      expertise die on its next saving throw or ability check.</p>
