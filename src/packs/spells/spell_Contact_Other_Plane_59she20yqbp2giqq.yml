  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You consult an otherworldly entity, risking your very mind in the
      process. Make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take
      6d6 psychic damage and suffer four levels of strife until you finish a
      long rest. A <em>greater restoration</em> spell ends this effect.</p><p>On
      a successful save, you can ask the entity up to 5 questions before the
      spell ends. When possible the entity responds with one-word answers: yes,
      no, maybe, never, irrelevant, or unclear. At the Narrator's discretion, it
      may instead provide a brief but truthful answer when necessary.</p>
