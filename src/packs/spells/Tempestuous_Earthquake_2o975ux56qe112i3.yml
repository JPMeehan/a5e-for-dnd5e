  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a seismic disturbance in the spell's area. Until the spell
      ends, an intense tremor rips through the ground and shakes anything in
      contact with it.</p><p>The ground in the spell's area becomes difficult
      terrain as it warps and cracks.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the
      end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature in contact
      with the ground in the spell's area must make a Dexterity saving throw or
      be knocked prone.</p><p>Additionally, any creature that is concentrating
      on a spell while in contact with the ground in the spell's area must make
      a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.</p><p>At the Narrator's
      discretion, this spell may have additional effects depending on the
      terrain in the area.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fissures:</strong> Fissures
      open within the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast
      the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations you choose. Each
      is 1d10 Ã— 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the
      spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a
      fissure opens makes a Dexterity saving throw or falls in. On a successful
      save, a creature moves with the fissure's edge as it
      opens.</p></li><li><p>A structure automatically collapses if a fissure
      opens beneath it (see below).</p></li><li><p><strong>Structures:</strong>
      A structure in contact with the ground in the spell's area takes 50
      bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell and again at the start of each
      of your turns while the spell is active. A structure reduced to 0 hit
      points this way collapses.</p></li><li><p>Creatures within half the
      distance of a collapsing structure's height make a Dexterity saving throw
      or take 5d6 bludgeoning damage, are knocked prone, and are buried in the
      rubble, requiring a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check as an action to
      escape. A creature inside (instead of near) a collapsing structure has
      disadvantage on its saving throw. The Narrator can adjust the DC higher or
      lower depending on the composition of the rubble. On a successful save,
      the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become
      buried.</p></li></ul><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare:
      Tempestuous Earthquake.</strong> The spell fills the area with violent
      winds. A flying creature halves its speed while in the area and makes a
      Dexterity saving throw at the start of each of its turns or falls
      prone.</p>
