      <p>You imbue the area with divine power, bolstering some creatures and
      hindering others. Celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead cannot
      enter the area. They are also incapable of charming, frightening, or
      possessing another creature within the area. Any such effects end on a
      creature that enters the area. When casting, you may exclude one or more
      creature types from this effect.</p><p>Additionally, you may anchor
      additional magical effects to the area. Choose one effect from the list
      below (the Narrator may also offer specific effects).</p><p>Some effects
      apply to creatures. You may choose to affect all creatures, creatures of a
      specific type, or those that follow a specific leader or deity. Creatures
      make a Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast, when they enter the
      area for the first time on a turn, or if they end their turn within the
      area. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the effect until it
      leaves the area.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Courage:</strong> Creatures in the
