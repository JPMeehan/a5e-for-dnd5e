      dir="ltr">You know that the portents of the gods are sometimes given in
      strange places. You spend 10 minutes adding vinegar to milk from a blessed
      cow, causing it to curdle and produce patterns from which you can divine
      the future. Roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier. Each
      result is stored into one curd of the cheese created by this spell. These
      curds do not spoil for the duration, and if left unused, simply disappear.
      Whenever you or a creature carrying one of these curds fails a saving
      throw, ability check, or attack roll, they may immediately consume the
      curd and add the result of the d6 to the roll.</p>
