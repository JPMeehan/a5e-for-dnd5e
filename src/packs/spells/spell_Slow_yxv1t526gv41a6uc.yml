      <p>If a slowed target casts a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll
      a d20. On an 11 or higher, the target doesn't finish casting the spell
      until its next turn. The target must use its action on that turn to
      complete the spell or the spell fails.</p>

      <p>At the end of each of its turns, a slowed target repeats the saving
      throw to end the spell's effect on it.</p>
