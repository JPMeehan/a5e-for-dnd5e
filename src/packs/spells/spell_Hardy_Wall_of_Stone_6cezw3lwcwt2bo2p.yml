  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone appears at a point you choose. The
      wall is 6 inches thick and is made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot
      square sections. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20- foot
      sections that are only 3 inches thick.</p>

      <p>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same
      space as a creature or object.&nbsp;The wall doesn't need to be vertical
      or rest on any firm foundation but must merge with and be solidly
      supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a
      chasm or create a ramp.</p>

      <p>If the wall enters a creature's space when it appears, the creature is
      pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be
      surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid
      surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move
      up to its Speed to escape.</p>

      <p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the
      size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to
      create crenelations, battlements, and so on.</p>

      <p>The wall is an object made of stone. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit
      points per inch of thickness.&nbsp;Reducing a panel to 0 hit points
      destroys it and at the Narrator's discretion might cause connected panels
      to collapse.</p>

      <p>You can make the wall permanent by concentrating on the spell for the
      full duration.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Hardy Wall of
      Stone.&nbsp;</strong>Each panel has&nbsp;AC 18 and 40 hit points per inch
      of thickness.&nbsp;Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it
      but&nbsp;does not cause connected panels to collapse.</p>
