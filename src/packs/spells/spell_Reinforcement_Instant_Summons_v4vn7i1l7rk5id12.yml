      <p>Until the spell ends, a mystical bond connects the target and the
      precious stone used to cast this spell.</p><p>Any time after, you may
      crush the stone and speak the name of the item, summoning it instantly
      into your hand no matter the physical, metaphysical, or planar distances
      involved, at which point the spell ends. If another creature is holding
      the item when the stone is crushed, the item is not summoned to you.
      Instead, the spell grants you the knowledge of who possesses it and a
      general idea of the creature's location.</p><p>Each time you cast this
      spell, you must use a different precious
      stone.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel
      Magic} or a similar effect targeting the stone ends the
      spell.</p><p><strong>Rare:&nbsp;<em>Reinforcement Instant
      Summons.&nbsp;</em></strong>The spell can target a willing creature and
      uses a&nbsp;precious statue carved to resemble the target. This material
      component costs 1,000 gold per Hit Die&nbsp;that the creature possesses.
      Once cast, you may&nbsp;summon the target the same way that you
      would&nbsp;summon an item. If the target is asleep, it is
      awakened&nbsp;when summoned. The target may decline the&nbsp;summons, in
      which case you are granted a general&nbsp;idea of the target&rsquo;s
      current location.</p>
