  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An opaque cube of banded force surrounds the area, preventing any
      matter or spells from passing through it, though creatures can breathe
      inside it. Creatures that make a Dexterity saving throw and creatures that
      are only partially inside the area are pushed out of the area. Any other
      creature is trapped and can't leave by nonmagical means. The cage also
      traps creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and can only be destroyed by being
      dealt at least 25 force damage at once or by a <em>dispel magic</em> spell
      cast using an 8th-level or higher spell slot.</p><p>If a trapped creature
      tries to teleport or travel to another plane, it makes a Charisma saving
      throw. On a failure, the attempt fails and the spell or effect is
      wasted.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The spell's
      area increases to a 20-foot cube when using a 9th-level spell slot.</p>
