      <p>When you cast this spell, choose an area of natural nonmagical
      rock/earth or mud that fits in the area, and choose one of the following
      effects:</p><p><strong>Transmute Mud to Rock</strong>: Mud, quicksand, or
      especially soft soil up to a depth of 10 feet turns to brittle stone until
      the spell is dispelled. Creatures within the area when it is transformed
      make Dexterity saving throws, becoming restrained on a failure or moving
      to the closest space outside of range on a success. A restrained creature
      can use its action to break free by making an Athletics check against your
      spell save DC; another creature within reach can attempt this check as an
      action to pull them out. The stone can also be damaged. The stone has AC
      10 and 50 hit points. It is immune to poison and psychic damage and
      vulnerable to thunder damage.</p><p><strong>Transmute Rock to
      Mud</strong>: Rock, soil, and packed sand is turned into mud or quicksand
      up to 10 feet deep until the spell is dispelled. The area becomes
      difficult terrain, requiring 4 feet of movement for every foot of movement
      to traverse. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast, or who
      enters the area or ends their turn in the area, must make a Strength
      saving throw or become restrained. A restrained creature can free itself
      as an action.</p><p>If this version is cast upon a stone ceiling, the mud
      collapses. Any creature in the area the mud falls must make a Dexterity
      save or take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and become restrained. Creatures that
      make their save take half damage and are not restrained. Restrained
      creatures can free themselves as an action. The mud creates a pile up to
      10 feet high that must be climbed over, and acts as hindering terrain as
      above.</p>
