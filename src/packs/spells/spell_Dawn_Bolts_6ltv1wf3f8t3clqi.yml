    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You bless the ammunition giving it the power to pierce the
      darkness. When you make a ranged weapon attack with one of the pieces of
      ammunition drawn from the container, it deals an additional 1d6 points of
      radiant damage. Then, hit or miss, the magic on that piece of ammunition
      dissipates.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> For
      each spell level above third, you may bless an additional 2 pieces of
      ammunition. If you use at least a 5th-level spell slot, all of the damage
      done by the ammunition is radiant rather than its normal type, and being
      hit with one of the pieces of ranged ammunition counts as spending a round
      in natural sunlight.</p>
