      dir="ltr">You conjure forth the enticing smells of bread, pastries, or
      some other freshly-baked good in an unoccupied space that you can see
      within range. Creatures of your choosing who start their turn in the area
      must make a Wisdom saving throw versus your spell save DC or be enticed to
      seek out the source of these delicious scents. On a failure, each affected
      creature moves in the direction of the smell as much as they can. As an
      action, you may move the area of effect to a different spot within range
      so long as you maintain concentration. Creatures that can see you or who
      are currently hostile towards you and your allies make their saves at
      advantage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels:</strong></p>

      <p dir="ltr">Increase the area of effect by 10 feet for every level above
      2nd.</p>
