      <p>When you cast this spell, select a 10-foot square section within range.
      If it is a hard, treated, or manufactured surface (such as wood, fabric,
      leather, stone, glass, or metal) it becomes spotlessly clean. Any foreign
      substances on the surface of the square that you specify such as dirt,
      blood, toxic chemicals, paint, ink, and so on vanish harmlessly, leaving
      the surface clean and sanitary. This cleaning makes it impossible to track
      a creature through the affected areas via mundane means, but the utter
      cleanliness may itself be suspicious. The spell has no effect on non-solid
      surfaces such as dirt, sand, or mud.</p>

      <p><strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Cast at Higher Levels:
      </strong><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">You may select an additional
      5-foot square for each slot level above 1st. Each square must touch
      another square along one side and all squares must be within
      range.</span></p>
