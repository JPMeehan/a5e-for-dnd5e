    value: >-
      <p>Walking through nature is good for the body and the soul of anyone, but
      for you and your companions, itâ€™s even more revitalizing.</p><p>While this
      spell is active, at the end of each hour you spend traveling through
      natural surroundings, you and a number of creatures up to your
      spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1) who are traveling with you
      recover hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, if you
      and your companions travel the entire duration of the spell without
      engaging in violence, you each recover a level of strife.</p>
