  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a creature from the realms celestial.</p><p>This creature
      uses the statistics of a celestial creature (detailed below) with certain
      traits determined by your choice of its type: an angel of battle, angel of
      protection, or angel of vengeance.</p><p>The creature is friendly to you
      and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours.</p><p>It
      obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only
      defends itself.</p><p>The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit
      points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose
      control of the celestial creature, which becomes hostile and might attack
      you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after
      you summoned it.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong>
      For each slot level above 7th the celestial creature's AC increases by 1,
      its hit points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it
      deals 1d4 extra damage.</p>
