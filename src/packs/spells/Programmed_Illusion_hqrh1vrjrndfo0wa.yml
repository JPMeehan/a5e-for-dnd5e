    value: >-
      <p>You craft an illusory object, creature, or other effect which executes
      a scripted performance when a specific condition is met within 30 feet of
      the area.</p><p>You must describe both the condition and the details of
      the performance upon casting. The trigger must be based on something that
      can be seen or heard.</p><p>Once the illusion triggers, it runs its
      performance for up to 5 minutes before it disappears and goes dormant for
      10 minutes. The illusion is undetectable until then and only reactivates
      when the condition is triggered and after the dormant period has
      passed.</p><p>A creature can use an action to attempt an Investigation
      check against your spell save DC to reveal the spell's illusory nature.
      Physical interactions reveal the illusion for what it is as things can
      pass through it with ease. A creature aware of the illusion perceives the
      image as transparent and the sounds it generates hollow.</p>
