      <p dir="ltr">With a single word, you send the targets into a blind panic
      to obey your will. Starting with the target with the lowest hit points
      (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets becomes frightened of you, and
      must spend its action to dash away from you as well as their normal
      movement. At the end of an affected creature&rsquo;s turns, it may make a
      charisma saving throw to end the effect, but whether it can see you or not
      is irrelevant and they continue to flee on each subsequent turn, expending
      their movement and taking the dash action, until they succeed at the
      saving throw or the spell ends.</p><p dir="ltr">As each target is
      frightened, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the
      next target. A target&rsquo;s hit points must be equal to or less than the
      total remaining for the spell to have any effect.</p><p dir="ltr">If the
      spell affects no creatures, the creature in the area with the lowest hit
      point total is rattled until the beginning of its next turn.</p><p
