    value: >-
      <p>You wrench open a hole in reality and summon a creature from the cracks
      between the planes. This creature uses the statistics of a conjured
      aberration. In addition, roll 1d4 or choose the aberration&rsquo;s general
      appearance.</p>

      <ol>

      <li>Squid-like</li>

      <li>Writhing ball of body parts</li>

      <li>Humanoid with featureless face</li>

      <li>Translucent worm</li>

      </ol>

      <p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn
      immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. Without such
      commands, the creature only defends itself. The creature disappears when
      reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell
      ends, you lose control of the aberration, which becomes hostile and
      attacks you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1
      hour after you summoned it.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Cast at Higher Levels</strong></em>. For each slot level
      above 5th, the aberration&rsquo;s AC increases by 1, its hit points
      increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra
      damage.</p>
