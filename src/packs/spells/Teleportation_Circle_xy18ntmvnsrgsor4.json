      "value": "<p>You draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground and open within it a shimmering portal to a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere in the world. The portal remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly travels to the destination circle.</p><p>Permanent teleportation circles are commonly found within major temples, guilds, and other important locations. Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in a certain pattern called a sigil sequence.</p><p>When you cast teleportation circle, you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle you know. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the Narrator. You can learn a new sigil sequence with 1 minute of observation and study.</p><p>Casting the spell in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent teleportation circle with its own unique sigil sequence. You do not need to teleport when casting the spell to make a permanent destination.</p>",
