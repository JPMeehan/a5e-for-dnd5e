  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, the target is warded by a mystic connection
      between it and you. While the target is within 60 feet it gains a +1 bonus
      to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Each time it
      takes damage, you take an equal amount of damage.</p><p>The spell ends if
      you are reduced to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated
      by more than 60 feet. It also ends if you use an action to dismiss it, or
      if the spell is cast again on either you or the
      target.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
