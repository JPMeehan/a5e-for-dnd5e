      <p>Your magic suppresses a creature's inhibitions, urging out its own
      self-destructive strength. Until the end of your next turn, it ignores the
      effects of&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">fatigue</span>. At the end
      of the duration, it takes an amount of psychic damage equal to 1d4 &times;
      the number of levels of fatigue it is suffering. Additionally, on its
      turn, it can take an additional action, which can&rsquo;t be used
      for&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">casting a spell</span>&nbsp;other
      than a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. If it takes this
      additional action, it suffers a level of fatigue at the end of its
      turn.</p>
