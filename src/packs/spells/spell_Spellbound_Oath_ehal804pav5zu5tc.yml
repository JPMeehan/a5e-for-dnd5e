  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell binds two creatures to an agreement spoken as the part of
      the casting of the spell in a language that both parties understand.</p>

      <p>The agreement must include a promise by both parties to do or refrain
      from doing something specific. The promises do not need to be the same or
      equal but mustn&rsquo;t be obviously harmful to either creature. For
      example, an archfey may promise to restore the freedom of a loved one in
      exchange for a mortal becoming their emissary.</p>

      <p>A creature attempting to act in a way that will breach the terms must
      make a Wisdom&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">saving throw</span> . On
      a failure, they find themselves unable to act as intended, ending their
      turn if they are in combat. Regardless, it suffers 52 (8d12) psychic
      damage for the attempt. Damage from this spell does not require a save for
      massive damage, though the creature makes death saving throws as
      usual.</p>
