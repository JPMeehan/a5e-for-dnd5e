  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your body melts into a humanoid-shaped mass of liquid flesh. Each
      creature within 5 feet of you that can see the transformation must make a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions and
      is frightened of you until the start of its next turn. Until the end of
      your turn, your Speed becomes 20 feet, you can't speak, and you can move
      through spaces as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. You revert to
      your normal form at the end of your turn.</p>
