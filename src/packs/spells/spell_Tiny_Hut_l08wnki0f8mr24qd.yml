  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an immobile dome of protective force that provides shelter
      and can be used as a safe haven (Chapter 4: Exploration in Trials &
      Treasures). The dome is of a color of your choosing, can't be seen through
      from the outside, is transparent on the inside, and can fit up to 10
      Medium creatures (including you) within.</p><p>The dome prevents inclement
      weather and environmental effects from passing through it, though
      creatures and objects may pass through freely. Spells and other magical
      effects can't cross the dome in either direction, and the dome provides a
      comfortable dry interior no matter the conditions outside of it. You can
      command the interior to become dimly lit or dark at any time on your
      turn.</p><p>The spell fails if a Large creature or more than 10 creatures
      are inside the dome. The spell ends when you leave the dome.</p>
