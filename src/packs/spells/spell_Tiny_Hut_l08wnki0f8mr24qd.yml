    value: >-
      <p>You create an immobile dome of protective force that provides shelter
      and can be used as a safe haven (Chapter 4: Exploration in Trials &amp;
      Treasures). The dome is of a color of your choosing, can't be seen through
      from the outside, is transparent on the inside, and can fit up to 10
      Medium creatures (including you) within.</p>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap;
      transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.9s;
      transition-delay: 0.212791s;">The dome prevents inclement weather and
      environmental effects from passing through it and bars any creature not
      within the spell&rsquo;s area when you cast it from entering, though
      creatures and objects that were within the spell&rsquo;s area may pass
      through freely. You can also allow a specific creature to enter the space,
      as long as there are not currently 10 creatures inside. Spells and other
      magical effects can&rsquo;t cross the dome in either direction, and the
      dome provides a comfortable dry interior no matter the conditions outside
      of it. You can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark at any
      time on your turn.</p>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap;
      transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.9s;
      transition-delay: 0.214535s;">The spell fails if a Large or larger
      creature or more than 10 creatures are inside the affected area when you
      cast the spell. The spell ends when you leave the dome or if more than 10
      creatures enter the dome.</p>
