    value: >-
      <p>An invisible sphere of antimagic forms around you, moving with you and
      suppressing all magical effects within it. At the Narrator's discretion,
      sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the
      sphere's effects.</p><ul class="indentedSelection"><li><strong>Area
      Suppression:</strong> When a magical effect protrudes into the sphere,
      that part of the effect's area is suppressed. For example, the ice created
      by a wall of ice is suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the
      wall if the overlap is large enough.</li><li><strong>Creatures and
      Objects:</strong> While within the sphere, any creatures or objects
      created or conjured by magic temporarily wink out of existence,
      reappearing immediately once the space they occupied is no longer within
      the sphere.</li><li><strong>Dispel Magic:</strong> The sphere is immune to
      dispel magic and similar magical effects, including other antimagic field
      spells.</li><li><strong>Magic Items:</strong> While within the sphere,
      magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and
      ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the
      sphere.</li><li><strong>Magical Travel:</strong> Whether the sphere
      includes a destination or departure point, any planar travel or
      teleportation within it automatically fails. Until the spell ends or the
      sphere moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that
      created by a bag of holding) within the sphere are
      closed.</li><li><strong>Spells:</strong> Any spell cast within the sphere
      or at a target within the sphere is suppressed and the spell slot is
      consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within the
      sphere. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent suppressed
      counts against it.</li></ul></p>
