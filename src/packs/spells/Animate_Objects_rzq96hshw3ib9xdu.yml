  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Objects come to life at your command just like you dreamt of when you
      were an apprentice! Choose up to 6 unattended nonmagical Small or Tiny
      objects. You may also choose larger objects; treat Medium objects as 2
      objects, Large objects as 3 objects, and Huge objects as 6 objects. You
      can't animate objects larger than Huge.</p><p>Until the spell ends or a
      target is reduced to 0 hit points, you animate the targets and turn them
      into constructs under your control.</p><p>Each construct has Constitution
      10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1, as well as a flying speed of
      30 feet and the ability to hover (if securely fastened to something
      larger, it has a Speed of 0), and blindsight to a range of 30 feet (blind
      beyond that distance). Otherwise a construct's statistics are determined
      by its size.</p><p>If you animate 4 or more Small or Tiny objects, instead
      of controlling each construct individually they function as a construct
      swarm. Add together all swarm's total hit points. Attacks against a
      construct swarm deal half damage. The construct swarm reverts to
      individual constructs when it is reduced to 15 hit points or
      less.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to mentally command any construct
      made with this spell while it is within 500 feet. When you command
      multiple constructs using this spell, you may simultaneously give them all
      the same command. You decide the action the construct takes and where it
      moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as
      guarding an area. Without commands the construct only defends itself. The
      construct continues to follow a command until its task is
      complete.</p><p>When you command a construct to attack, it makes a single
      slam melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit the
      construct deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage appropriate to
      its shape.</p><p>When the construct drops to 0 hit points, any excess
      damage carries over to its normal object form.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</em></strong> You can animate 2 additional Small or Tiny
      objects for each slot level above 5th.</p>
