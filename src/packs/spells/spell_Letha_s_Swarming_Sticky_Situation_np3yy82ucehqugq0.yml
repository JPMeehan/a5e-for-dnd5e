      dir="ltr">You magically flood the area with honey, jam, or some other
      sticky substance. For the duration of the spell, this area counts as
      difficult terrain and any creature entering the area for the first time
      must make a Strength saving throw versus your spell save DC or be knocked
      prone as they slip and fall. While a creature is knocked prone in this
      way, they are also restrained. Creatures knocked prone may repeat their
      saving throw at the beginning of their turn and are no longer prone or
      restrained on a success.</p><p dir="ltr">Creatures that succeed on their
      Strength saving throw still have whatever limbs that came into contact
      with the sticky surface covered in the substance. On their turn they may
      make an Athletics check to adhere themselves to vertical surfaces and
      climb them, as per the spider climb spell. This effect lasts so long as
      you are able to maintain concentration. If a creature is adhered to a
      surface when the spell ends, they immediately fall.</p><p

      dir="ltr"><strong>Letha&rsquo;s Swarming Sticky Situation.</strong> The
      honey or other saccharine liquid you used to entrap your foes also
      attracts stinging insects. All creatures knocked prone in the area take
      4d4 piercing damage as bees swarm into the area and attack. This damage
      persists every round until a creature manages to leave the affected area
      or the spell ends.</p>
