    value: >-
      <p>You toss a handful of ash into the air and obstruct your enemies&rsquo;
      line of sight, giving you a moment to make a quick getaway. You may move
      up to half of your movement speed away from enemy creatures. Additionally,
      one ally within 15 feet of you may also move up to half of their movement
      speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
