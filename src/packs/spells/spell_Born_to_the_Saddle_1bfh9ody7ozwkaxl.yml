      <p dir="ltr">With a word of encouragement and a gentle pat, you bolster
      your mount&rsquo;s body and mind.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">For the spell&rsquo;s duration, you have advantage on Animal
      Handling checks related to the target. In addition, all of its movement
      speeds increase by 20 feet and it gains an expertise die on saving throws.
      Finally, it can maintain a gallop travel speed for the entire
      spell&rsquo;s duration, which does not count against the usual 1 hour per
      day limit. If you cast the spell on another creature before it ends, the
      spell ends early.</p>
