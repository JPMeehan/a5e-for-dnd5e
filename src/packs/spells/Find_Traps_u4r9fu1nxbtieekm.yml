  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell reveals whether there is at least one trap within range and
      within line of sight. You don't learn the number, location, or kind of
      traps detected. For the purpose of this spell, a trap is a hidden
      mechanical device or magical effect which is designed to harm you or put
      you in danger, such as a pit trap, symbol spell, or alarm bell on a door,
      but not a natural hazard.</p>
