      <p>Your touch implants a vile plague in a creature&rsquo;s mind. While a
      creature is under the effects of this spell and can see you, you can use
      an action to force it to make a Wisdom&nbsp;saving throw</span>&nbsp;. On
      a failure, it takes a level of&nbsp;strife&nbsp;. You can only inflict a
      number of levels in strife equal to half your proficiency&nbsp;bonus in
      this way each time you cast this spell.</p><p>The target knows it has been
      enchanted and can recognize you as the source of this effect with a Wisdom
      (Insight) check against your&nbsp;<span>spell save&nbsp;DC.</p>
