      <p dir="ltr">Burying the cog in the sand in your hand, you dump it all out
      and the grains shimmer and fade. As does the target.&nbsp;</p><p
      dir="ltr">The target ceases to exist until the beginning of its next
      respective turn, and pops back into being when that happens. During this
      time the space it occupied is empty, and it cannot be targeted by spells
      or effects. If its space has become occupied, the target is shunted to the
      nearest available safe space when it returns.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong

      Higher Levels.</strong> When you use a spell of 2nd level or higher to
      cast this spell the target instead ceases to exist for 2 rounds. And one
      additional round for every spell slot above 2nd.</p>
