    value: >-
      <p>You bless the ground to accommodate a specific crop in a 130-foot
      square area. The soil alters its composition to become ideal for that
      specific plant, purging contaminants (such as salt or other undesirable
      minerals), instantly decomposing any bodies lying in its soil down to a
      depth of 5 feet, and dispelling curses of up to 4th level. For a year and
      a day, plants of the type specified at the casting of the spell produce
      50% more yield than they normally would, potentially increasing the income
      of a farm if properly harvested. Bodies destroyed by this spell
      immediately become useless for speak with dead, animate dead,
      resurrection, and other similar spells that require a body (the bodies of
      particularly powerful magical creatures may not be affected by this spell
      at the Narrator's discretion).</p>
