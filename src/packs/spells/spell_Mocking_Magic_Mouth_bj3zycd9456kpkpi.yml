  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is imbued with a spoken message of 25 words or fewer which
      it speaks when a trigger condition you choose is met. The message may take
      up to 10 minutes to convey.</p>

      <p>When your trigger condition is met, a magical mouth appears on the
      object and recites the message in the same voice and volume as you used
      when instructing it. If the object chosen has a mouth (for example, a
      painted portrait) this is where the mouth appears.</p>

      <p>You may choose upon casting whether the message is a single event, or
      whether it repeats every time the trigger condition is met.</p>

      <p>The trigger condition must be based upon audio or visual cues within 30
      feet of the object, and may be highly detailed or as broad as you
      choose.</p>

      <p>For example, the trigger could be when any attack action is made within
      range, or when the first spring shoot breaks ground within range.</p>
