      <p>You only require line of sight to the target (not line of effect) and
      it has advantage on its saving throw to resist the spell if you or your
      companions are fighting it. Until the spell ends, the target is charmed by
      you and friendly towards you.</p>

      <p>The spell ends if you or your companions do anything harmful towards
      the target. The target knows it was charmed by you when the spell
      ends.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level
      above 1st, you affect one additional target that is within 30 feet of
      other targets.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><strong>Rare: Gorana's Inveigling Charm Person. </strong>The duration
      of the spell is increased to 8 hours, 24 hours with a 5th or higher level
      spell slot. In addition, you may increase the casting time to 1 hour to
      instead have the duration last a year or until dispelled or dismissed by
      you. If the target is already charmed by you, they have disadvantage on
      the saving throw against this longer cast version, but on successful save
      are immune to that version cast by you for 1 year. If you expend a 6th or
      higher level spell slot you may instead target a creature up to 1 mile
      away using the 1 hour cast time version, provided you have a piece of them
      to use as a material component.</p>
