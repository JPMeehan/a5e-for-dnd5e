    value: >-
      <p>You unleash the discipline of your magical training and let arcane
      power burn from your fists, consuming the material components of the
      spell. Until the spell ends you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
      and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and on each of your turns you
      can use an action to make a melee spell attack against a target within 5
      feet that deals 4d8 force damage on a successful hit.</p><p>For the
      duration, you cannot cast other spells or concentrate on other spells. The
      spell ends early if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile
      creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end
      this spell early on your turn as a bonus action.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a spell slot of 5th- or 6th-level,
      the damage increases to 5d8.</p><p>When using a spell slot of 7th- or
      8th-level, the damage increases to 6d8. When using a spell slot of
      9th-level, the damage increases to 7d8.</p>
