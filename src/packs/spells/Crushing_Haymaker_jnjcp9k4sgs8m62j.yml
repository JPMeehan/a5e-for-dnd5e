  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your fist reverberates with destructive energy, and woe betide whatever
      it strikes. As part of casting the spell, make a melee spell attack
      against a creature or object within 5 feet. If you hit, the target of your
      attack takes 7d6 thunder damage, and must make a Constitution saving throw
      or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of its next turn. This
      spell's damage is doubled against objects and
      structures.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      spell deals an extra 1d6 of thunder damage for each slot level above
      3rd.</p>
