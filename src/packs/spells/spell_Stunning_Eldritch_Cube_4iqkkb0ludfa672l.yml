  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A black, nonreflective, incorporeal 10-foot cube appears in an
      unoccupied space that you can see. Its space can be in midair if you so
      desire. When a creature starts its turn in the cube or enters the cube for
      the first time on its turn it must make an Intelligence saving throw,
      taking 5d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half damage on a
      success.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can move the cube up to 10 feet in
      any direction to a space you can see. The cube cannot be made to pass
      through other creatures in this way.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Stunning Eldritch Cube.</strong> A creature that
      takes 20 or more damage from this spell is stunned until the end of its
      next turn. </p>
