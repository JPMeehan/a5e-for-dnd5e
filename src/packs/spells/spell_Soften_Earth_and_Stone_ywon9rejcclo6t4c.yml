    value: >-
      <p>Upon casting the spell, all natural, unworked earth or stone in the
      area is softened. Soil becomes mud, dry earth becomes loose sand, and
      stone becomes soft clay. A 10-ft<sup>2</sup> area is softened to a depth
      of 1 to 4 feet of your choosing. Each material has the following
      effects:</p><p><strong>Mud</strong>: Creatures in the space when you cast
      the spell, or creatures who enter the space, must make a Strength saving
      throw or be restrained for 1 round. The mud is considered difficult
      terrain.</p><p><strong>Sand</strong>: Sand is considered difficult
      terrain.</p><p><strong>Clay</strong>: Clay is not difficult terrain, but
      it can be cut and worked more easily than stone, and is a useful material
      in its own right.</p><p>Casting this spell as mud or sand upon cave
      ceilings or walls can cause cave ins. Any creature in the area the
      material falls must make a Dexterity save or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage
      and become restrained. Creatures that make their save take half damage and
      are not restrained. Restrained creatures can free themselves as an action.
      The material leaves behind hindering terrain, as above.</p><p>Casting this
      spell under structures can cause the structure to settle, damaging the
      structure but not destroying it unless the entire structure is damaged in
      such a way. A structure takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10 foot
      section affected.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> Add an
      additional 10 foot square for every slot level above 2nd. Each square must
      be contiguous, touching at least one other square.</p>
