  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. Suggest an
      activity phrased in a sentence or two. The targets are magically
      influenced to follow that course of activity. The suggestion must be
      worded to sound reasonable. Asking the targets to perform an action that
      is obviously harmful to them ends the spell.</p><p>A target carries out
      the activity suggested by you as well as it can. The activity can last for
      the duration of the spell, and if it requires less time the spell ends
      after a target has carried out the activity.</p><p>You may specify trigger
      conditions that cause a target to perform a specific activity while the
      spell lasts. For example, you may suggest that the target takes off its
      clothes and dives the next time it sees a body of water. If the target
      does not see a body of water before the spell ends, the specific activity
      isn't performed.</p><p>Any damage done to a target by you or an ally ends
      the spell for that creature.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When cast using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration
      of the spell increases to 10 days. When cast using an 8th-level spell
      slot, the duration increases to 30 days. When cast using a 9th-level spell
      slot, the duration increases to a year and a day.</p>
