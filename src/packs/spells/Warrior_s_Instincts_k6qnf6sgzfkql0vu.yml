  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your senses sharpen, allowing you to anticipate incoming attacks and
      find weaknesses in the defenses of your foes. Until the spell ends,
      creatures cannot gain bonuses (like those granted by bless or expertise
      dice) or advantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, none of your
      movement provokes opportunity attacks, and you ignore nonmagical difficult
      terrain. Finally, you can end the spell early to treat a single weapon
      attack roll as though you had rolled a 15 on the
      d20.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot
      level above 5th, you can also apply this spell's benefits to an additional
      creature you can see within 30 feet.</p>
