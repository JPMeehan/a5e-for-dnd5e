  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create illusions which manifest the deepest fears and worst
      nightmares in the minds of all creatures in the spell's area. Each
      creature in the area makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened
      until the spell ends. At the end of each of a frightened creature's turns,
      it makes a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a
      successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>
