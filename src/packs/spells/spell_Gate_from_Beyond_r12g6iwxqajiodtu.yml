    value: >-
      <p>You rend the veil to create a short-range portal from your location to
      any place you can see, visualize, or describe by stating distance and
      direction such as 200 feet straight downward or 400 feet upward at a
      30-degree angle to the southeast. The other end of the portal appears
      within 5 feet of you and you suffer a level of strife.</p>

      <p>A creature within 5 feet of either end of the portal can use 5 feet of
      movement to step through, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet
      of the other end. If there is no such space, it is moved to the nearest
      unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet moved. The
      portal remains open for as long as you maintain concentration and remain
      within 5 feet of one end of it, but for the duration of your concentration
      you suffer an additional level of strife at the end of each of your turns
      after the first.</p>
