    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">Holding a small doll or figure that you created to resemble
      your target, you strike at it, put it into danger, or otherwise do harm
      which translates from the effigy to your target. As an action on each of
      your turns, and as part of the action casting this spell, you may choose
      one of the following options.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Control: </strong>By sharply
      turning the doll in your hand, you force the target of your spell to lash
      out, making a weapon attack against a target of your choosing with any
      weapon the creature has readied.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Jerk: </strong>By jerking the
      effigy sharply you cause your target to move, jerkily and as if not under
      their own control, up to half their movement rate.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Stab: </strong>Using a hatpin,
      dagger, or other sharp implement, you may stab the doll, dealing between
      1d8 + Int modifier and 3d8 + Int modifier piercing or necrotic damage to
      your target. You may choose to do more or less damage by aiming for more
      or less sensitive parts of the effigy.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The creature may make charisma saving throws against any
      action you attempt to force them to perform. If you have created this
      effigy by spending ten minutes of preparation using an item owned by or
      body part (such as hair or fingernails) of your target, they have
      disadvantage on a charisma save to resist any of the individual effects.
      The spell can be ended early with remove curse or similar magic. If you
      created an effigy using the create likeness spell, the target makes their
      saves normally.The spell does not end on a successful save, but the effect
      does not take hold.</p>
