  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of fire on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60
      feet long (it does not have to be a straight line; sections of the wall
      can angle as long as they are contiguous), 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick,
      or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot
      thick. The wall blocks sight.</p>

      <p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity
      saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful save.</p>

      <p>One side of the wall (chosen when the spell is cast) deals 5d8 fire
      damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or
      inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall
      itself for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side
      of the wall deals no damage.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases
      by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
