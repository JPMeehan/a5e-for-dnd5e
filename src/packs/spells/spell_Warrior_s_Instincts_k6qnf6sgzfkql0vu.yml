      <p>Until the spell ends, creatures cannot gain bonuses (like those granted
      by bless or expertise dice) or advantage on attack rolls against you. In
      addition, none of your movement provokes opportunity attacks, and you
      ignore nonmagical difficult terrain. Finally, you can end the spell early
      to treat a single weapon attack roll as though you had rolled a 15 on the
      d20.</p>

      find weaknesses in the defenses of your foes. Until the spell ends,
      creatures cannot gain bonuses (like those granted by bless or expertise
      dice) or advantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, none of your
