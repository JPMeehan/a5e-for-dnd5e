      <p>You unleash a jet of condensed air which threatens to damage property
      and lift creatures off their feet. One target within range must make a
      Strength saving throw. On a fail, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage; if the
      target is Large-sized or smaller, it is also pushed 5 feet. The damage
      increases by 1d6 and the distance increases by 5 when you reach 5th level
      (2d6, 10 feet), 11th level (3d6, 15 feet), and 17th level (4d6, 20
      feet).</p>
