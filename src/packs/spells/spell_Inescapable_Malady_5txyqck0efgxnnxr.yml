  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You infect your target with an arcane disease. At any time after you
      cast this spell, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the
      target, you can use an action to deal 7d10 necrotic damage to the target.
      If this damage would reduce the target to 0 hit points, you can choose to
      leave it with 1 hit point.</p>

      <p>As part of dealing the damage, you may expend a 7th-level spell slot to
      sustain the disease. Otherwise, the spell ends. The spell ends when you
      die.</p>

      <p>Casting <em>remove curse</em>, <em>greater restoration</em>, or heal on
      the target allows the target to make a Constitution saving throw against
      the disease. Otherwise the disease can only be cured by a <em>wish</em>
      spell.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases
      by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.</p>
