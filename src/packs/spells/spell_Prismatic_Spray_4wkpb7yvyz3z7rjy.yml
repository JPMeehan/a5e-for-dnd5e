  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You unleash 8 rays of light, each with a different purpose and effect.
      For each target in the area, roll a d8 to determine the ray that affects
      it.</p><p>1&mdash;Red: The target takes 10d6 fire
      damage.</p><p>2&mdash;Orange: The target takes 10d6 acid
      damage.</p><p>3&mdash;Yellow: The target takes 10d6 lightning
      damage.</p><p>4&mdash;Green: The target takes 10d6 poison
      damage.</p><p>5&mdash;Blue: The target takes 10d6 cold
      damage.</p><p>6&mdash;Indigo: The target is restrained and at the end of
      each of its turns it makes a Constitution saving throw. Once it
      accumulates two failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it
      accumulates two successful saves the effect ends.</p><p>7&mdash;Violet:
      The target is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the target makes a
      Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>On a failed
      save, the target is banished to another random plane and is no longer
      blind. If it originated from another plane it returns there, while other
      creatures are generally cast into the Astral Plane or Ethereal
      Plane.</p><p>8&mdash;Special: The target is hit by two rays.</p><p>Roll a
      d8 twice to determine which rays, rerolling any 8s.</p>
