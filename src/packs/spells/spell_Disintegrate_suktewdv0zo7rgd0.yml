  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A pale ray emanates from your pointed finger to the target as you
      attempt to undo it.</p><p>The target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. A
      creature reduced to 0 hit points is obliterated, leaving behind nothing
      but fine dust, along with anything it was wearing or carrying (except
      magic items). Only true resurrection or a wish spell can restore it to
      life.</p><p>This spell automatically disintegrates nonmagical objects and
      creations of magical force that are Large-sized or smaller. Larger objects
      and creations of magical force have a 10-foot-cube portion disintegrated
      instead. Magic items are unaffected.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level
      above 6th.</p>
