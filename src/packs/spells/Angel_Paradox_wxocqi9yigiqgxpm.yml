  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is bombarded with a fraction of energy stolen from some
      slumbering, deific source, immediately taking 40 radiant damage. This
      spell ignores resistances but does not ignore immunities. A creature
      killed by this spell does not decay and cannot become undead for the
      spell's duration. Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count
      against the time limit of spells such as <em>raise dead</em>. This effect
      ends early if the corpse takes necrotic damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage and duration increase to 45
      radiant damage and 1 year when using an 8th-level spell slot, or 50 damage
      and until dispelled when using a 9th-level spell slot.</p>
