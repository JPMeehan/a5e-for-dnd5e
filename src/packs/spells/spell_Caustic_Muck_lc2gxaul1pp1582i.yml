      <p dir="ltr">You soften a patch of dry ground you can see within range
      into a horrible caustic mire. The spell&rsquo;s area becomes difficult
      terrain. A creature that enters the area for the first time on its turn or
      begins its turn in the area must make a Strength saving throw or be
      grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC) and take 2d6 points of
      acid damage. A creature that begins its turn grappled by the spell also
      takes 2d6 points of acid damage.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong

      Higher Levels. </strong>The acid damage increases by 1d6 for each spell
