  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You animate and enrage a target building that lashes out at its
      inhabitants and surroundings. As a bonus action you may command the target
      to open, close, lock, or unlock any nonmagical doors or windows, or to
      thrash about and attempt to crush its inhabitants. While the target is
      thrashing, any creature inside or within 30 feet of it must make a
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage on a failed save
      or half as much on a successful one. When the spell ends, the target
      returns to its previous state, magically repairing any damage it sustained
      during the spell's duration.</p>
