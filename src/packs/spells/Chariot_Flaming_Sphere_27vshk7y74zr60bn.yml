  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears within range, lasting for the
      duration. It casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for
      another 20 feet, and ignites unattended flammable objects it
      touches.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to move the sphere up to 30
      feet. It can jump over pits 10 feet wide or obstacles 5 feet tall. If you
      move the sphere into a creature, the sphere ends its movement for that
      turn and the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire
      damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature
      that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving
      throw against the sphere's damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
      above 2nd.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Chariot
      Flaming Sphere.</strong> If you are Medium or smaller you can use 5 feet
      of your movement to enter or exit the sphere. While inside, you can’t be
      harmed by the sphere, you move with it when it moves, and creatures take
      1d4 fire damage when they hit you with a melee attack.</p>
