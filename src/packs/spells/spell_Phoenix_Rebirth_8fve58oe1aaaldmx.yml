      <p>Fire is the element of destruction, but that destruction brings about
      rebirth. The mighty phoenix embodies this the best, and this spell
      harnesses its power. When you cast this spell, your body explodes in an
      awe inspiring blast of flames. Targets in the area take 11d6 fire damage
      from the explosion, and then you are reduced to ash.</p><p>At the start of
      your next turn, you are restored to life from your ashes with 11d6 hit
      points. You are also cured of any blindness, deafness, and diseases
      afflicting you, and you can choose to regenerate any missing body parts.
      This also frees you from the Doomed condition.</p><p><strong>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell
      slot, increase the damage dealt and amount of hit points regained by
      2d6.</p>
