  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your voice takes on a magical timbre, awakening the targets to limited
      sentience. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate with you and
      follow simple commands, telling you about recent events including
      creatures that have passed, weather, and nearby locations.</p>

      <p>The targets have a limited mobility: they can move their branches,
      tendrils, and stalks freely. This allows them to turn ordinary terrain
      into difficult terrain, or make difficult terrain caused by vegetation
      into ordinary terrain for the duration as vines and branches move at your
      request. This spell can also release a creature restrained by an entangle
      spell.</p>

      <p>At the Narrator's discretion the targets may be able to perform other
      tasks, though each must remain rooted in place. If a plant creature is in
      the area, you can communicate with it but it is not compelled to follow
      your requests.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rare:&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Insightful Speak with
      Plants.&nbsp;</strong>So long&nbsp;as your spell save DC is higher than
      the passive&nbsp;Insight score of a plant you are conversing
      with,&nbsp;you can use an action to view the memories of&nbsp;an event the
      plant is describing.</p>
