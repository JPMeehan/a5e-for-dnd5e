  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion that alerts you whenever a
      creature of size Tiny or larger touches or enters the warded area. When
      you cast the spell, choose any number of creatures. These creatures don't
      set off the alarm.</p><p>Choose whether the alarm is silent or audible.
      The silent alarm is heard in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the
      warded area and it awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm
      produces a loud noise of your choosing for 10 seconds within 60
      feet.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You may
      create an additional alarm for each slot level above 1st. The spell's
      range increases to 600 feet, but you must be familiar with the locations
      you ward, and all alarms must be set within the same physical structure.
      Setting off one alarm does not activate the other alarms.</p><p>You may
      choose one of the following effects in place of creating an additional
      alarm. The effects apply to all alarms created during the spell's
      casting.</p><p>Increased Duration. The spell's duration increases to 24
      hours.</p><p>Improved Audible Alarm. The audible alarm produces any sound
      you choose and can be heard up to 300 feet away.</p><p>Improved Mental
      Alarm. The mental alarm alerts you regardless of your location, even if
      you and the alarm are on different planes of existence.</p>
