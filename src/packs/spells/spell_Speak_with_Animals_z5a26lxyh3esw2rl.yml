  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You call upon the secret lore of beasts and gain the ability to speak
      with them. Beasts have a different perspective of the world, and their
      knowledge and awareness is filtered through that perspective. At a
      minimum, beasts can tell you about nearby locations and monsters,
      including things they have recently perceived. At the Narrator's
      discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor
      for you.</p>
