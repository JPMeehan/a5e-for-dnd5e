    value: >-
      <p>You imbue the target with nature's magical energy. Until the spell
      ends, the target becomes a magical weapon (if it wasn't already), its
      damage becomes 1d8, and you can use your spellcasting ability instead of
      Strength for melee attack and damage rolls made using it. The spell ends
      if you cast it again or let go of the target.</p>
