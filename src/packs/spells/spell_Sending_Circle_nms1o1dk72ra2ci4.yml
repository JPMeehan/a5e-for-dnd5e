    value: >-
      <p>You create a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground, opening&nbsp;the
      phonic space to a permanent sending circle elsewhere&nbsp;in the world.
      For the duration of the spell, sounds pass&nbsp;through the two sending
      circles, allowing creatures on&nbsp;opposite sending circles to verbally
      communicate as though&nbsp;they were in the same room. You can use your
      action on&nbsp;your turn to end this spell early.</p>

      <p>Permanent sending circles are commonly found within major harpy
      enclaves, including seasonal roosts, mountain temples, and other important
      locations. Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in
      a certain pattern called a sigil sequence. When you cast sending circle,
      you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a sending circle you
      know. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the
      sigil sequences for 2 established sending circles on the Material Plane,
      determined by the Narrator. You can learn the sigil sequence of a sending
      circle you see after 1 minute of observation and study. Casting the spell
      in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent sending
      circle with its own unique sigil sequence.</p>
