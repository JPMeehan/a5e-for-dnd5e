      <p>You reach through a portal to a demiplane of infinite weaponry, and the
      armaments you pull arc forth like shooting stars. When you cast this
      spell, make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 30 feet. This
      attack produces a melee weapon of your choice made of magical energy from
      that dimension which hurtles at the target. On a hit, the target takes
      force damage equal to 1d12 + your spellcasting ability
      modifier.</p><p>Until this spell ends, you can repeat this attack as a
      bonus action. Each weapon produced is considered an artifact for the
      purpose of bypassing various magical defenses. Weapons produced by this
      spell disappear after hitting or missing their target.</p><p><strong>Cast
      At Higher Levels</strong>: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of
      6th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level
      above 5th.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong><em>Shirou's Sublime
      Bladeworks.</em></strong> Instead of flinging a weapon at a target, you
      may instead wield it as a melee weapon. Attacking with this weapon is a
      melee spell attack that deals 1d12 force damage + your Spellcasting
      ability modifier. It has a range of 5 feet and cannot be disarmed. You can
      make one attack with the weapon in the same bonus action you pull it
      forth. You may wield two such weapons at once, but retrieving each
      requires a separate bonus action. A weapon wielded by you in this way
      exists until you let go of it, or until the spell ends.</p>
