  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. Suggest an
      activity phrased in a sentence or two. The target is magically influenced
      to follow that course of activity. The suggestion must be worded to sound
      reasonable. Asking the target to perform an action that is obviously
      harmful to it ends the spell.</p><p>The target carries out the activity
      suggested by you as well as it can. The activity can last for the duration
      of the spell, and if it requires less time the spell ends after the target
      has carried out the activity.</p><p>You may specify trigger conditions
      that cause the target to perform a specific activity while the spell
      lasts. For example, you may suggest that the target takes off its clothes
      and dives the next time it sees a body of water. If the target does not
      see a body of water before the spell ends, the specific activity isn't
      performed.</p><p>Any damage done to the target by you or an ally ends the
      spell for that creature.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> When using a 4th-level spell slot, the duration is
      concentration, up to 24 hours. When using a 5th-level spell slot, the
      duration is 7 days. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1
      year. When using a 9th-level spell slot, the suggestion lasts until it is
      dispelled.</p><p>Any use of a 5th-level or higher spell slot grants a
      duration that doesn't require concentration.</p>
