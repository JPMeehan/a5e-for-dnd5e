    value: >-
      <p>You impart sentience to a door, window, gate, lid, or other object that
      can be opened, closed, and locked. You grant it an Intelligence, Wisdom,
      and Charisma of 10. The door retains its hit points, AC, and other
      characteristics, and is considered an object. If the door is reduced to 0
      hit points, it is killed and the spell ends.</p>

      <p>The door is able to open, close, lock, and unlock by itself, and can
      speak and understand one language that you know. If arcane lock is cast on
      the door, the door can activate and deactivate the spell at will. The door
      is friendly to you and follows your orders.</p>
