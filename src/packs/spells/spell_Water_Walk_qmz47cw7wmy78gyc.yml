      <p>Until the spell ends, the targets are able to move across any liquid
      surface (such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava) as if it was
      solid ground.</p>

      <p>Creatures can still take damage from surfaces that would deliver damage
      from corrosion or extreme temperatures, but they do not sink while moving
      across it.</p>

      <p>A target submerged in a liquid is moved to the surface of the liquid at
      a rate of 60 feet per round.</p>
