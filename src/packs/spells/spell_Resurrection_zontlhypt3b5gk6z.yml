  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Provided the target's soul is willing and able to return to its body,
      so long as it is not undead it returns to life with all of its hit
      points.</p><p>The spell cures any poisons and nonmagical diseases that
      affected the target at the time of death.</p><p>It does not remove any
      magical diseases, curses, or other magical effects; these must be removed
      prior to the spell being cast, otherwise they immediately take effect when
      the target returns to life. The spell closes all mortal wounds and
      restores any missing body parts.</p><p>Being raised from the dead takes a
      toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The target takes a -4 penalty to
      attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.</p><p>At the conclusion
      of each long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until the target completely
      recovers.</p><p>Resurrecting a creature that has been dead for one year or
      longer is exhausting. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells
      again and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and
      saving throws.</p>
