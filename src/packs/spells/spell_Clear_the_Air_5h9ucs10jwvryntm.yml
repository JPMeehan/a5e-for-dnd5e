    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">With a forceful word and a wave of your hand, you clear the
      air, literally and figuratively.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">All aerosol and particulate contaminants and hazards such as
      poisonous gas, steam, smoke, disease, and even pollen and foul smells are
      instantly purged from the spell&rsquo;s area. Creatures suffering ill
      effects from a purged contaminant immediately gain another saving throw,
      ending the effect on a success. In addition, creatures suffering from
      effects causing them to be charmed, confused, or frightened also gain a
      new saving throw against the effect, ending it on a success.</p>
