    value: >-
      <p>Your shot glows brightly as it streaks toward its target.</p><p>As part
      of the action used to cast this spell, make a ranged weapon attack against
      a target within range of the weapon you are wielding. On a hit, the target
      takes normal weapon damage and sheds bright light to a range of 20 feet
      from its point of impact and dim light to a range of 40 feet from its
      point of impact. Alternatively, you may fire the shot into the sky, where
      it slowly descends over the course of a minute, shedding bright light to a
      range of 100 feet and dim light to a range of 200 feet. If it impacts
      something, the ranges decrease to 20/40 feet as if you had fired it into a
      target. You may only have one such light effect active at a time. If you
      cast the spell again, the prior target/shot stops glowing
      immediately.</p><p>At 5th level, the target takes an additional 1d4 points
      of radiant damage on a hit. This increases to 2d4 at level 11 and 3d4 at
      level 17.</p>
