  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, you automatically sense the presence of magic
      within range, and you can use an action to study the aura of a magic
      effect to learn its schools of magic (if any).</p><p>The spell penetrates
      most barriers but is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1
      inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a 2nd-level spell slot or higher,
      the spell no longer requires your concentration. When using a 3rd-level
      spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 1 hour. When using a
      4th-level spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours.</p><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Specific Detect
      Thoughts.</strong> You can scan the thoughts of all creatures within range
      and locate one creature currently thinking about a single subject you
      choose when you cast the spell. You can read its thoughts as described in
      the spellâ€™s description. This spell does not reveal the creature having
      these thoughts, and until you determine which creature it is you cannot
      shape the course of its thoughts so the information you receive may be
      limited.</p>
