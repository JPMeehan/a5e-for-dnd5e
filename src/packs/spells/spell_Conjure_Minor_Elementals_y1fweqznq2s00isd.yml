  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon up to 3 creatures from the Elemental Planes. These creatures
      use the statistics of a minor elemental (detailed below) with certain
      traits determined by your choice of its type: air, earth, fire, or water.
      If you summon only 2 creatures with this spell, increase its effective
      slot level by 1 when determining the minor elemental's statistics, and if
      you summon a single creature with this spell its effective slot level is
      increased by 2 instead.</p><p>The summoned creatures are friendly to you
      and your companions and take their turns immediately after yours. They
      obey your verbal commands. When you command multiple minor elementals
      using this spell, you must give them all the same command.</p><p>Without
      such commands, a minor elemental only defends itself.</p><p>The summoned
      creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is
      broken before the spell ends, you lose control of any summoned creatures,
      which become hostile and might attack you and your companions. An
      uncontrolled creature disappears at the end of the spell's maximum
      duration.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Use the
      higher spell slot level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat
      block.</p>
