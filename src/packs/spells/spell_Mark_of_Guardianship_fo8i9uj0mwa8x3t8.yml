      <p dir="ltr">You mark a creature as your charge and gain the ability to
      protect it more effectively.</p><p dir="ltr">For the duration of this
      spell, you know the general direction of the creature you placed the mark
      on as long as it is on the same plane as you. You know its exact direction
      if you are within 10 miles, and its precise location if you are within 100
      feet of it. Whenever you use a spell or feature to heal the creature, you
      may reroll any die rolls of 1 when determining how many hit points you
      restore. You must use the new roll, even if it is also a 1.</p><p

      Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this with a spell slot of at least 2nd
      level, you also know whether the creature is at full health, at less than
      full health but not bloodied, bloodied, unconscious and making death
      saves, unconscious but stable, or dead. If you cast it with at least a
      3rd-level spell slot, in addition to the above benefits any healing you do
      to the creature increases by an additional 1d4. This additional healing
      increases by an additional 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd. If you cast
      it with at least a 4th-level spell slot, the duration increases to 24
      hours. If you cast it with at least a 5th-level spell slot, the duration
      increases to a week.</p>
