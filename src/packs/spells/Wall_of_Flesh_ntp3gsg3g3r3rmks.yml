  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A squirming wall of bodies, groping arms and tentacles, and moaning,
      biting mouths heaves itself up from the ground at a point you choose. The
      wall is 6 inches thick and is made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot
      square sections. The wall can have any shape you desire.</p><p>If the wall
      enters a creature's space when it appears, the creature makes a Dexterity
      saving throw, and on a success it moves up to its Speed to escape. On a
      failed save, it is swallowed by the wall (as below).</p><p>When a creature
      enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn within 10
      feet of the wall, tentacles and arms reach out to grab it. The creature
      makes a Dexterity saving throw or takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and becomes
      grappled. If the creature was already grappled by the wall at the start of
      its turn and fails its saving throw, a mouth opens in the wall and
      swallows the creature.</p><p>A creature swallowed by the wall takes 5d8
      ongoing bludgeoning damage and is blinded, deafened, and
      restrained.</p><p>A creature grappled or restrained by the wall can use
      its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On
      a success, a grappled creature frees itself and a restrained creature
      claws its way out of the wall's space, exiting to an empty space next to
      the wall and still grappled.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
      above the 6th.</p>
