      <p>You reshape the target into any form you choose.</p><p>For example, you
      could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or chest, make a small
      passage through a wall (as long as it isn't more than 5 feet thick), seal
      a stone door shut, or create a hiding place. The target can have up to two
      hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't
      possible.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You may
      select one additional target for every slot level above 4th.</p>
