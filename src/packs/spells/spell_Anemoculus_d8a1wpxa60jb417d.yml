      <p>You condense air to change its optical properties, granting you diverse
      means of enhancing your perceptions. When you cast this spell, you
      manifest one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Eye of
      Air.</strong> Choose a point you can see within range. You create a
      Tiny-sized invisible magical sensor at that point which lasts until the
      spell ends. As an action, you can look through this sensor, replacing your
      line of sight for its line of sight until the end of your
      turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ocular Artifice.</strong> This spell
      manipulates the air in one of your empty hands, so it functions as one of
      the following items until the spell ends: a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.j507mbgy4l8lzg22]{Magnifying
      Glass}, a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.e60aql3bu3l7xvqy]{Spyglass}, or a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.bkphsiyih05ks5jp]{Steel Mirror}.
      This effect is similar to a conjured item, and may be placed or passed to
      another creature accordingly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rangefinder.</strong>
      Until the spell ends, you do not suffer the penalties for attacking at
      long range with your ranged weapons. Instead, these penalties apply to
      your melee attacks and your attacks with ranged weapons made at standard
      range. You can end this effect early on your turn (no
      action).</p></li><li><p><strong>Shimmer.</strong> You wreath one creature
      within range with a mirage-like visual distortion. It gains an expertise
      die to its AC against the next ranged attack made against it before the
      spell ends; the spell then immediately ends.</p></li></ul><p>You can only
      have one instance of this spell active at a time. The number of ongoing
      effects you can have from this spell increases when you reach 5th level
      (two effects), 11th level (three effects), and 17th level (four
      effects).</p>
