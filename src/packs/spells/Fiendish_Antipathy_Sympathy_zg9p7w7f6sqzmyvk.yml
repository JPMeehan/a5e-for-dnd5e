    value: >-
      <p>You mystically impart great love or hatred for a place, thing, or
      creature. Designate a kind of intelligent creature, such as dragons,
      goblins, or vampires.</p><p>The target now causes either antipathy or
      sympathy for the specified creatures for the duration of the spell. When a
      designated creature successfully saves against the effects of this spell,
      it immediately understands it was under a magical effect and is immune to
      this spell's effects for 1
      minute.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Antipathy:</strong> When a designated
      creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature
      makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened. While frightened the
      creature must use its movement to move away from the target to the nearest
      safe spot from which it can no longer see the target. If the creature
      moves more than 60 feet from the target and can no longer see it, the
      creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened
      again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of
      it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sympathy:</strong> When a designated creature
      can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature uses its
      movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of
      the target, and is unwilling to move away from the target.</p><p>If the
      target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected
      creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect. An affected
      creature can also make a saving throw once every 24 hours while within the
      area of the spell, and whenever it ends its turn more than 60 feet from
      the target and is unable to see the target.</p></li></ul><hr
