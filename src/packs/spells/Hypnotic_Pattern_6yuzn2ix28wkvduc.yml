  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a swirling pattern of twisting hues that roils through the
      air, appearing for a moment and then vanishing. Creatures in the area that
      can perceive the pattern make a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. A
      creature charmed by this spell becomes incapacitated and its Speed is
      reduced to 0.</p><p>The effect ends on a creature when it takes damage or
      when another creature uses an action to shake it out of its daze.</p>
