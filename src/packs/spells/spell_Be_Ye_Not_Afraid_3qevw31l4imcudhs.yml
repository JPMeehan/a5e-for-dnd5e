      <p dir="ltr">With a single word of divine power, you transform yourself
      into a fearsome messenger of divine wrath. Your form transforms into
      something distinctly non-humanoid. The details are left to you and the
      narrator, but masses of wings and eyes, burning wheels, and
      similarly-alien forms are common.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">While the spell lasts, you gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain a fly speed of 120 feet and can
      hover.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You do not need to breathe.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You are immune to radiant, fire, and
      poison damage.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You are immune to the Blinded, Charmed,
      Confused, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone,
      Restrained, Slowed, and Stunned conditions.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Hostile creatures who see you must make a
      saving throw against your spell save DC with disadvantage or become
      frightened of you until the spell ends. A creature may repeat this save at
      the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature
      that fails its save by 10 more suffers a mild heart attack, is stunned for
      1 round, and gains a level of fatigue.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If a friendly creature becomes
      frightened, you may use your reaction to cancel the effect that caused the
      condition.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Friendly creatures within 100 feet of you
      automatically stabilize when reduced to 0 hit points. If you come within
      100 feet of a friendly creature that is already making death saves, it
      immediately stabilizes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain truesight with a range of 60
      feet.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain a radiant blast attack. Treat it
      as a ranged weapon attack dealing 4d8 radiant damage with a range of
      60/300 feet.</p>

      </li>
