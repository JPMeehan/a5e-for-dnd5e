  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You give a command to a target which can understand you. It becomes
      charmed by you.</p><p>While charmed in this way, it takes 5d10 psychic
      damage the first time each day that it disobeys your command. Your command
      can be any course of action or inaction that wouldn't result in the
      target's death. The spell ends if the command is suicidal or you use an
      action to dismiss the spell. Alternatively, a <em>remove curse</em>,
      <em>greater restoration</em>, or <em>wish</em> spell cast on the target
      using a spell slot at least as high as the slot used to cast this spell
      also ends it.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      spell's duration is 1 year when using a 7th-level spell slot, or permanent
      until dispelled when using a 9th-level spell slot.</p>
