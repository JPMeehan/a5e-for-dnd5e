  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You assert control over the target humanoid's mind and it is charmed
      for the duration. If it is engaged in combat with you or creatures
      friendly to you, it has advantage on its saving throw.</p><p>Until the
      charmed condition ends, you establish a telepathic link with it while you
      are on the same plane. You may issue commands through this link and the
      target does its best to obey. No action is required to issue commands,
      which can be a simple and general course of action such as &quot;Attack
      that target, &quot; &quot;Go over there, &quot; or &quot;Bring me that
      object.&quot; Without commands the target only defends itself. The target
      continues to follow a command until its task is complete.</p><p>You can
      use your action to assume direct control of the target. Until the end of
      your next turn, you decide all of the target's actions and it does nothing
      you do not allow it to. While a target is directly controlled in this way,
      you can also cause it to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your
      own reaction as well.</p><p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a
      new saving throw against the spell, ending the spell on a
      success.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The
      spell's duration is extended: 6th-level&mdash;Concentration (10 minutes),
      7th-level &mdash;Concentration (1 hour), 8th-level &mdash;Concentration (8
      hours).</p>
