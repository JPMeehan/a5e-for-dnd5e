  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a roiling, noxious cloud that hinders creatures and leaves
      them retching. The cloud spreads around corners and lingers in the air
      until the spell ends.</p><p>The area is heavily obscured. A creature in
      the area at the start of its turn makes a Constitution saving throw or
      uses its action to retch and reel.</p><p>Creatures that don't need to
      breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on the save.</p><p>A
      moderate wind (10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds, a
      strong wind (20 miles per hour) after 1 round.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at
      Higher Levels.</em></strong> The spell's area increases by 5 feet for
      every 2 slot levels above 3rd.</p>
