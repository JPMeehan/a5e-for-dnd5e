      <p>Until the spell ends, the target drops anything it is holding and
      cannot use its hands to grasp objects or perform complex tasks. A target
      can still cast any spell that does not specifically require its hands.</p>

      <p>When making unarmed strikes, the target can use its spellcasting
      ability or Dexterity (its choice) instead of Strength for the attack and
      damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In addition, the target's unarmed strikes
      deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and count as magical for the purpose of
      overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
