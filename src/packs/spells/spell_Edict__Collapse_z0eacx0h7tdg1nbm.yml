      <p dir="ltr">Your targets fall to the ground, babbling in tongues. Chains
      of radiant gold or nebulous shadow rise up to bind your targets and hold
      them fast. Starting with the target with the lowest hit points (ignoring
      unconscious creatures), targets become prone and have a movement speed of
      0 while the spell persists. In addition they cannot cast spells which
      require a verbal component. At the end of each of the creature&rsquo;s
      turns they may attempt a charisma save to end the effect.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">As each collapses, subtract its hit points from the total
      before moving on to the next target. A target&rsquo;s hit points must be
      equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any
      effect.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">If the spell affects no creatures, the creature in the area
      with the lowest hit point total is rattled until the beginning of its next
      turn.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong
      id="docs-internal-guid-baf92998-7fff-3d15-974a-95674d41d617">Cast at
      Higher Levels.</strong> The spell affects an additional 2d10 hit points
      worth of creatures for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
