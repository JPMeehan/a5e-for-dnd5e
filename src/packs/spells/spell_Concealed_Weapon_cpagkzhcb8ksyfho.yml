  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, you utter a command word and transform one
      non-magical weapon into a mundane object of roughly equivalent size. For
      example you might change a dagger into a book or a sword into a broom. As
      a bonus action, a creature can grasp the item and utter the command word
      again to end the spell early, transforming the object back into its
      original weapon form.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Cast At Higher Levels. </strong>By using a 3rd-level spell
      slot, you can transform a common, uncommon, or rare magical weapon this
      way (though the object it becomes is still non-magical). A 4th level spell
      slot can transform a very rare weapon, and a 5th-level can transform a
      legendary weapon.</p>
