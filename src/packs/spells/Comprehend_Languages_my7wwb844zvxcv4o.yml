  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain a +10 bonus on Insight checks made to understand the meaning
      of any spoken language that you hear, or any written language that you can
      touch. Typically interpreting an unknown language is a DC 20 check, but
      the Narrator may use DC 15 for a language closely related to one you know,
      DC 25 for a language that is particularly unfamiliar or ancient, or DC 30
      for a lost or dead language. This spell doesn't uncover secret messages or
      decode cyphers, and it does not assist in uncovering
      lies.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The bonus
      increases by +5 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
