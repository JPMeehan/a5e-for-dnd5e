  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You project a phantasmal image into the minds of each creature in the
      area showing them what they fear most. On a failed save, a creature
      becomes frightened until the spell ends and must drop whatever it is
      holding.</p><p>On each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell
      uses its action to take the Dash action and move away from you by the
      safest available route. If there is nowhere it can move, it remains
      stationary. When the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't
      have line of sight to you, the creature can repeat the saving throw,
      ending the spell's effects on it on a successful save.</p><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Feast of Fear.</strong> The
      spell affects every creature within 30 feet of you. When you first cast
      the spell and again at the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary
      hit points equal to the number of frightened creatures you can see within
      30 feet of you.</p>
