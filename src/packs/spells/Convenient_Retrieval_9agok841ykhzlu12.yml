  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You reach into the container and instantly retrieve an object,
      regardless of its position in the container. This allows you to quickly
      snatch an item from an extradimensional space such as a&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">bag of holding</span>, as well as retrieving
      items from more conventional containers, such as backpacks and sacks. For
      this spell to work, you must be holding or wearing the container, it must
      not be locked, tied shut, or otherwise secured, and it must contain the
      item you wish to retrieve. If any of these conditions are not met, the
      spell fails.</p>

      <p>You may retrieve a specific object known to you, provided that you have
      observed it within 30 feet at least once. You may also choose to retrieve
      a certain type of object (for example, an instrument, ring, or weapon), at
      which point the Narrator randomly determines the specific item of that
      type you end up with. If the item can be wielded, such as a shield or
      weapon, the spell ends with you wielding it if you choose.</p>
