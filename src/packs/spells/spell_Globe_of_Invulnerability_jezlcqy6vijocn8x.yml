  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An immobile, glimmering sphere forms around you. Any spell of 5th-level
      or lower cast from outside the sphere can't affect anything inside the
      sphere, even if it's cast with a higher level spell slot. Targeting
      something inside the sphere or including the globe's space in an area has
      no effect on anything inside.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> The barrier blocks spells of one spell slot level
      higher for each slot level above 6th.</p>
