  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a magic portal, a door between a space you can see and a
      specific place on another plane of existence. Each portal is a one-sided
      circular opening from 5 to 25 feet in diameter. Entering either portal
      transports you to the portal on the other plane. Deities and other planar
      rulers can prevent portals from opening in their domains.</p><p>When you
      cast this spell, you can speak the true name of a specific creature (not
      its nickname or title). If that creature is on another plane, the portal
      opens next to it and draws it through to your side of the portal. This
      spell gives you no power over the creature, and it might choose to attack
      you, leave, or listen to you.</p>
