      dir="ltr">You summon forth a flood of grease into the specified area,
      which immediately ignites upon casting. Creatures in the affected area
      must make a Dexterity saving throw versus your spell save DC, taking [[/r
      5d8]] fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success.&nbsp; The
      area flooded by this fiery grease is considered difficult terrain for the
      duration of the spell and any creatures who remain in the grease
      automatically take [[/r 3d4]] fire damage at the start of their
      turn.</p><p dir="ltr">This fire cannot be extinguished through the use of
      water, and if water is applied to this fire in any way (such as in create
      or destroy water), it instead causes a fiery explosion in the area grease
      fire is currently affecting. All creatures within the spell&rsquo;s area
      of effect must make an additional Dexterity saving throw. On a failure,
      the affected creatures take [[/r 2d8]] fire damage and [[/r 2d8]] force
      damage and are knocked prone from the blast. Creatures who succeed take
      half damage and are not knocked prone.</p><p dir="ltr">This fire persists
      for 10 rounds and does not require concentration. After 10 rounds have
      passed, the fire quenches itself and disappears.</p>
