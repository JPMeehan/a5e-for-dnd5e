    value: >-
      <p>You craft an illusion to deceive others about the target's true magical
      properties.</p><p>Choose one or both of the following effects. When cast
      upon the same target with the same effect for 30 successive days, it lasts
      until it is dispelled.</p><ul class="indentedSelection"><li><strong>False
      Aura:</strong> A magical target appears nonmagical, a nonmagical target
      appears magical, or you change a target's magical aura so that it appears
      to belong to a school of magic of your choosing. Additionally, you can
      choose to make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the
      item.</li><li><strong>Masking Effect:</strong> Choose a creature type.
      Spells and magical effects that detect creature types (such as a herald's
      Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell) treat the target as if it
      were a creature of that type. Additionally, you can choose to mask the
      target's alignment trait (if it has one).</li></ul></p><p><strong><em>Cast
      at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When cast using a 6th-level spell slot or
      higher the effects last until dispelled with a bonus action.</p>
