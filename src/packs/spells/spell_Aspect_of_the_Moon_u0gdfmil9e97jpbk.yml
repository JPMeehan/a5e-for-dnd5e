      <p>Until the spell ends your hair grows, your features become more feral,
      and sharp claws grow on your fingers. You gain a +1 bonus to AC, your
      Speed increases by 10 feet, you have advantage on Perception checks, and
      your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 slashing damage. You may use your Strength
      or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes, and treat
      your unarmed strikes as weapons with the finesse property. You gain an
      additional action on your turn, which may only be used to make a melee
      attack with your unarmed strike. If you are hit by a silvered weapon, you
      have disadvantage on your Constitution saving throw to maintain
      concentration.</p>
