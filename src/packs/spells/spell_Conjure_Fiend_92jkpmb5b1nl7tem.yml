      <hr>

      <p>You summon a fiend from the lower planes not aligned with Hell or the
      Abyss. his creature uses the statistics of a <em>fiendish creature</em>
      with certain traits determined by your choice of its type: nightmare,
      malcubus, or shadow fiend.</p>

      <p>When casting this spell, you must make a charisma saving throw with a
      DC of 10 + the spell slot level used to cast the spell or gain a level of
      strife, unless you have the Evil alignment trait. You have disadvantage on
      this save if you have the Good alignment trait.</p>

      <p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn
      immediately after yours.</p>

      <p>It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only
      defends itself.</p>

      <p>The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your
      concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the
      creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions.
      An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level
      above 5th the <em>fiendish creature</em>'s AC increases by 1, its hit
      points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals
      1d4 extra damage. This additional damage is fire for the nightmare's hoof
      attack.</p>
