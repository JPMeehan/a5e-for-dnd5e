  description:
    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">With a loud noise of your choosing and a sharp, potentially
      rude, gesture, you draw the attention of creatures within the targeted
      area toward you and away from others.</p><p dir="ltr">On a failed save,
      creatures within the 10ft square gain disadvantage on Perception checks
      until the start of your next turn unless those Perception checks involve
      you. In addition, one creature of your choice can attempt to hide, even if
      they lack cover or concealment, from affected targets. If they intend to
      remain hidden after the end of your next turn, however, they must seek
      cover or concealment as normal.</p><p dir="ltr">At levels 5, 10, and 15
      you can choose additional creatures that may attempt to hide without cover
      or concealment.</p>
