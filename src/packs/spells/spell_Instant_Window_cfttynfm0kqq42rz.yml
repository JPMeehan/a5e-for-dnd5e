      <p>You create a window roughly 4 inches square, centered on the point that
      you touch. If the surface is more than 1 foot thick or made of materials
      other than wood, dirt, or stone, the spell fails. The window is
      sufficiently braced to prevent any structural weakening to the surrounding
      structure, but otherwise is just a small hole you can look through. The
      hole lasts for 1 minute, then vanishes. The hole can also be dismissed by
      the caster as a bonus action. Creatures in this space when the window
      vanishes are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take
      1d6 force damage for every square moved.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Glass pane: the window comes with a pane of glass (AC 5, 2 hit
      points), which functions as a normal window pane, keeping rain, outside
      air, etc. out and inside air in.</li>

      <li>Small-sized: the window is of sufficient diameter for a Small-sized
      creature to squeeze through as an action.</li>

      <li>Medium-sized (counts as two features):the window is of sufficient
      diameter for a Medium creature to squeeze through as an action. Small
      creatures can pass through as part of their normal movement.</li>

      <li>Barred: the window has heavy iron bars (AC 19, 50 hit points) covering
      it, granting&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">three-quarters
      cover</span>.</li>

      <li>Increased duration: the window lasts for an additional minute. This
      feature can be chosen multiple times, increasing the duration by 1 minute
      each time.</li>
