      <p>A torrent of wind erupts from your hand in a direction you choose. Each
      creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area must
      succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet from you in the
      direction of the line.</p><p>Any creature in the area must spend 2 feet of
      movement for every foot moved when trying to approach you.</p><p>The blast
      of wind extinguishes small fires and disperses gas or vapor.</p><p>You can
      use a bonus action to change the direction of the gust.</p><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Traveling Gust of Wind.
      </strong>The spell targets one vehicle of Huge size or smaller that has
      sails and its duration increases to concentration (1 hour). Until the
      spell ends, the vehicleâ€™s sails are magically filled and it can travel as
      if it had a strong wind. Additionally, any checks made to pilot the
      vehicle have advantage.</p>
