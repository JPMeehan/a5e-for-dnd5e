  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You sculpt an illusory duplicate of the target from ice and snow. The
      duplicate looks exactly like the target and uses all the statistics of the
      original, though it is formed without any gear, and has only half of the
      target's hit point maximum. The duplicate is a creature, can take actions,
      and be affected like any other creature. If the target is able to cast
      spells, the duplicate cannot cast spells of 7th-level or higher.</p><p>The
      duplicate is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It follows your
      spoken commands, and moves and acts on your turn in combat. It is a static
      creature and it does not learn, age, or grow, so it never increases in
      levels and cannot regain any spent spell slots.</p><p>When the simulacrum
      is damaged you can repair it in an alchemy lab using components worth 100
      gold per hit point it regains. The simulacrum remains until it is reduced
      to 0 hit points, at which point it crumbles into snow and melts away
      immediately.</p><p>If you cast this spell again, any existing simulacrum
      you have created with this spell is instantly destroyed.</p>
