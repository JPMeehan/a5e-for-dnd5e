    value: >-
      <p>You create a seismic disturbance in the spell's area. Until the spell
      ends, an intense tremor rips through the ground and shakes anything in
      contact with it.</p><p>The ground in the spell's area becomes difficult
      terrain as it warps and cracks.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the
      end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature in contact
      with the ground in the spell's area must make a Dexterity saving throw or
      be knocked prone.</p><p>Additionally, any creature that is concentrating
      on a spell while in contact with the ground in the spell's area must make
      a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.</p><p>At the Narrator's
      discretion, this spell may have additional effects depending on the
      terrain in the area.</p><p><strong>Fissures:</strong> Fissures open within
      the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell.
      A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations you choose. Each is
      [[1d10]] &times; 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of
      the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where
      a fissure opens makes a Dexterity saving throw or falls in. On a
      successful save, a creature moves with the fissure's edge as it
      opens.</p><p>A structure automatically collapses if a fissure opens
      beneath it (see below).</p><p><strong>Structures:</strong> A structure in
      contact with the ground in the spell's area takes 50 bludgeoning damage
      when you cast the spell and again at the start of each of your turns while
      the spell is active. A structure reduced to 0 hit points this way
      collapses.</p><p>Creatures within half the distance of a collapsing
      structure's height make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 bludgeoning
      damage, are knocked prone, and are buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20
      Acrobatics or Athletics check as an action to escape. A creature inside
      (instead of near) a collapsing structure has disadvantage on its saving
      throw. The Narrator can adjust the DC higher or lower depending on the
      composition of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half
      as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.</p>
