When the being does not know, you receive &quot;unclear&quot; as an answer. The being does not try to deceive, and the Narrator may offer a short phrase as an answer if necessary.</p><p>When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a no answer increases.</p><p>The Narrator makes the following roll in secret: second casting &mdash;25%, third casting &mdash;50%, fourth casting&mdash;75%, fifth casting&mdash;100%.</p>",
