      <p>Water inside the area is yours to command. On the round you cast it,
      and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can choose
      one of the following effects. When you choose a different effect, the
      current one ends.</p><ul
      class="indentedSelection"><li><strong>Flood:</strong> The standing water
      level rises by up to 20 feet. The flood water spills onto land if the area
      includes a shore, but when the area is in a large body of water you
      instead create a 20-foottall wave. The wave travels across the area and
      crashes down, carrying Huge or smaller vehicles to the other side, each of
      which has a 25% chance of capsizing. The wave repeats on the start of your
      next turn while this effect continues.</li><li><strong>Part
      Water:</strong> You create a 20-foot wide trench spanning the area with
      walls of water to either side. When this effect ends, the trench slowly
      refills over the course of the next round.</li><li><strong>Redirect
      Flow:</strong> Flowing water in the area moves in a direction you choose,
      including up. Once the water moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its
      regular flow based on the
      terrain.</li><li><strong><strong>Whirlpool:</strong></strong> If the
      affected body of water is at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, a
      whirlpool forms within the area in a 50-foot wide cone that is 25 feet
      long. Creatures and objects that are in the area and within 25 feet of the
      whirlpool make an Athletics check against your spell save DC or are pulled
      10 feet toward it. Once within the whirlpool, checks made to swim out of
      it have disadvantage. When a creature first enters the whirlpool on a turn
      or starts its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw or takes 2d8
      bludgeoning damage and is pulled into the center of the whirlpool. On a
      successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't
      pulled.</li></ul>
