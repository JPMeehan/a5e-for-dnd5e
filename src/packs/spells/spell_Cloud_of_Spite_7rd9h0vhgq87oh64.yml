    value: >-
      <p>Mist condenses at your will, forming into a dark, infant thundercloud
      that rumbles and flashes with the miniature forces of nature within. You
      conjure a Medium-sized stormcloud in an unoccupied space you can see
      within range, which lasts until the spell ends.</p><p>The stormcloud is
      opaque, blocking line of sight. The stormcloud does not block movement,
      although creatures who pass through its space are moistened by its water
      density.</p><p>You can move the stormcloud on your turn as a bonus action,
      up to a distance equal to 5 feet x your proficiency bonus. The stormcloud
      is dispelled by strong forces of wind, as well as from an attack from a
      magical weapon, and from any amount of fire, thunder, or force damage.
      When you cast this spell, each creature within 5 feet must make a
      Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 lightning damage. For the duration, you
      can repeat this effect as an action.</p><p>This damage increases by 1d4
      when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level
      (4d4).</p>
