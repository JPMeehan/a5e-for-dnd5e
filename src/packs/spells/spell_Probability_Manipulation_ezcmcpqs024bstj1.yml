      <p dir="ltr">You reach out and tug upon the strings of fate itself,
      bringing about a result you desire.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You may cast this spell whenever you or another creature
      would roll a die other than a d20, d100, or percentile die. You may set
      the result of that die roll. If more than one die is being rolled at once,
      you may choose any of the dice to affect, but only one, and it may not be
      a d20, d100, or percentile die. You may not use this spell on rolls
      private to the Narrator (such as random encounter table results) or on the
      die used to determine a creature&rsquo;s hit points upon leveling up.</p>

      Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this with a spell slot of at least 2nd
      level, you may change the result of an additional die from the same roll
      for each spell slot level above 1st. In addition, if you cast this spell
      with an 8th or 9th level spell slot, you may use it to manipulate the
      result of a single d20, d100, or percentile die roll instead.</p>
