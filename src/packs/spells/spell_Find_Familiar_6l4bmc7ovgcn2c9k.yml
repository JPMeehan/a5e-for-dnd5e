  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your familiar, a spirit that takes the form of any CR 0 beast of Small
      or Tiny size, appears in an unoccupied space within range. It has the
      statistics of the chosen form, but is your choice of a celestial, fey, or
      fiend (instead of a beast).</p><p>Your familiar is an independent creature
      that rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn in combat (but
      cannot take the Attack action). However, it is loyal to you and always
      obeys your commands.</p><p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it
      vanishes without a trace. Casting the spell again causes it to
      reappear.</p><p>You are able to communicate telepathically with your
      familiar when it is within 100 feet. As long as it is within this range,
      you can use an action to see through your familiar's eyes and hear through
      its ears until the beginning of your next turn, gaining the benefit of any
      special senses it has. During this time, you are blind and deaf to your
      body's surroundings.</p><p>You can use an action to either permanently
      dismiss your familiar or temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension
      where it awaits your summons. While it is temporarily dismissed, you can
      use an action to call it back, causing it to appear in any unoccupied
      space within 30 feet of you.</p><p>You can't have more than one familiar
      at a time, but if you cast this spell while you already have a familiar,
      you can cause it to adopt a different form.</p><p>Finally, when you cast a
      spell with a range of Touch and your familiar is within 100 feet of you,
      it can deliver the spell as if it was the spellcaster. Your familiar must
      use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell
      requires an attack roll, use your attack bonus for the spell.</p>
