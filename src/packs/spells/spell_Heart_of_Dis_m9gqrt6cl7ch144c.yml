      <p>You magically replace your heart with one forged on the second layer of
      Hell. While the spell lasts, you are immune to fear and can't be poisoned,
      and you are immune to fire and poison damage. You gain resistance to cold
      damage, as well as to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from
      nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered. You have advantage on saving
      throws against spells and other magical effects. Finally, while you are
      conscious, any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet
      of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
      frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On a success, the
      creature is immune to the effect for 24 hours.</p><p>Casting this spell
      magically transports your mortal heart to the lair of one of the lords of
      Hell. The heart returns to your body when the spell ends. If you die while
      under the effects of this spell, you can't be brought back to life until
      your original heart is retrieved.</p>
