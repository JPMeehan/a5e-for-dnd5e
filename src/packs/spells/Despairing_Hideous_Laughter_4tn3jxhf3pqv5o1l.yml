  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is overwhelmed by the absurdity of the world and is crippled
      by paroxysms of laughter. The target falls prone, becomes incapacitated,
      and cannot stand.</p><p>Until the spell ends, at the end of each of the
      target's turns and when it suffers damage, the target may attempt another
      saving throw (with advantage if triggered by damage). On a successful
      save, the spell ends.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</em></strong> Target an additional creature within 30 feet of the
      original for each slot level above 1st.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p><strong>Rare: Despairing Hideous Laughter.</strong> When the
      mirth fades the target is affected with crushing grief, sadness, and
      despair, causing it to sob uncontrollably. The emotional toll of the spell
      causes the target to have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack
      roll, or saving throw it makes after the spell ends.</p>
