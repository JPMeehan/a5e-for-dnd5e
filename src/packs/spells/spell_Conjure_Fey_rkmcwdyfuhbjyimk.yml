  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a creature from The Dreaming.</p><p>This creature uses the
      statistics of a fey creature (detailed below) with certain traits
      determined by your choice of its type: hag, hound, or redcap.</p><p>The
      creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn
      immediately after yours.</p><p>It obeys your verbal commands. Without such
      commands, the creature only defends itself.</p><p>The summoned creature
      disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken
      before the spell ends, you lose control of the summoned creature, which
      becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled
      creature disappears at the end of the spell's maximum
      duration.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each
      slot level above 6th the fey creature's AC increases by 1, its hit points
      increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra
      damage.</p>
