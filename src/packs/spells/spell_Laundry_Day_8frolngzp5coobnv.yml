    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, choose a pile of laundry that you can see
      within range, weighing up to 25 pounds and occupying a single 5-foot
      square, to clean and repair. Threadbare or worn laundry is restored to as
      new condition, and even extremely damaged laundry (bloodstained, cut to
      tatters in a combat, etc.) is restored. As long as at least half the
      material that comprises an article of laundry is present, it can be
      restored by this spell. This spell leaves no trace that the object was
      damaged.</p><p>This spell affects anything made of cloth, so even rugs,
      small sails, and tapestries may be restored. Magic items and constructs
      may be repaired in this way, but their magic is not restored. You gain
      an&nbsp;expertise die</span> on maintenance checks if you are able to cast
      this spell on the item you are treating.</p><p><strong>Cast at Higher
      Levels.</strong><strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>
      </em></strong><span>For each spell slot level above 2nd, this spell can
      affect an additional 25 pounds of laundry occupying up to one additional
      5-foot square.</p>
