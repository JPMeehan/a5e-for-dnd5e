      <p>While casting this spell, you touch a wound on a creature or corpse. If
      the wound was inflicted by an object, such as a weapon, you know exactly
      what the specific item looks like for the purposes of spells like<em>
      </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.84xbuk6c7yo86ga7]{Locate
      Object}. For the duration of the spell you also know the object&rsquo;s
      general direction and its current trajectory if it&rsquo;s
      traveling.</p><p>The spell fails if the wound was inflicted by a
      creature&rsquo;s natural weapons, such as fists or claws, or by a spell.
      The spell also fails if the wound was inflicted more than 3 days ago. If
      the weapon is more than 5 miles away, has been destroyed, or if there is
      any thickness of lead in the direct path between you and the object, the
      spell is unable to provide its direction.</p><p><strong style="font-size:
      10.5pt;"><em>Cast at Higher Levels</em>. </strong>When using a 3rd-level
      spell slot, the spell&rsquo;s duration increases to 10 minutes and it can
      detect a weapon up to 30 miles away.</p>
