      <p dir="ltr">Your travels have led you to experience a little bit of
      everything. You score a critical success on ability checks on a roll of
      19&ndash;20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of
      your critical successes, your critical success range increases by 1
      (maximum 17&ndash;20). Whenever you would roll on an Ability Check
      Critical Success table, roll twice and choose one of the results. If both
      rolls are identical, reroll one of them.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Finally, whenever you gain a sign of faith, you may instead
      choose an adventuring trick from the bard class or an exploration knack
      from the ranger class, substituting your cleric level for any level
      prerequisites.</p>
