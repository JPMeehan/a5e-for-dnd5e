      <p>At 2nd level your combat experience becomes obvious on some subtle
      level, influencing how people perceive you, or perhaps how you see them.
      Choose one of the following options:</p><h3 class="Indent1">Closed
      Helm</h3><p>You have great control over your emotions; your face is an
      unmoving mask, revealing nothing of what you&rsquo;re thinking. Creatures
      have&nbsp;disadvantage&nbsp;on Insight checks made against you. In
      addition, you gain an&nbsp;expertise die&nbsp;on&nbsp;saving
      throws&nbsp;against
      being&nbsp;charmed&nbsp;or&nbsp;frightened&nbsp;.</p><h3
      class="Indent1">Heroic Flair</h3><p>Your victories have emboldened you and
      you radiate with heroic confidence. You have&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;on
      Persuasion checks made to influence friendly creatures with a CR lower
      than your fighter&nbsp;level.</p><h3 class="Indent1">Watchful
      Eye</h3><p>You are eternally alert and wary, ready for trouble. You
      have&nbsp;advantage on Insight checks made to determine hostile intent or
      predict violence, and your passive Perception increases by 5.</p>
