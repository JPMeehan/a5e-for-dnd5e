      <p>In exchange for forgoing bloodshed—torture, attacking unconscious
      creatures, and dealing lethal wounds to creatures you reduce to 0 hit
      points—you are yourself granted mercy. When you have already succeeded on
      two death saving throws, you have advantage on death saving throws.</p>
