      <p>Beginning at level 2, while no slouch in the magic department, you’ve
      found that hiding this fact until an opportune time can be useful. You
      gain proficiency with the Deception and Sleight of Hand skills. You may
      rely on legerdemain, saving the real magic for when it’s truly needed, or
      you may just have an ability to surreptitiously take small items like
      scrolls and wands without notice. Or both. You may always choose to use
      Intelligence when making Deception checks.</p><p>You’re also able to work
      much faster when copying spells to your spellbook. The time to copy a new
      spell is halved</p>
