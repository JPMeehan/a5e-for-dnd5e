      <p>You cause a target creature to triple the range of its ranged weapon
      attack. The creature also has advantage to hit and does not receive
      disadvantage for long-range shots. Then, for the next minute, all of the
      creature&rsquo;s attacks with ranged weapons are reduced to one-third
      their usual distance and only add half of the creature&rsquo;s proficiency
      bonus to hit.</p>
