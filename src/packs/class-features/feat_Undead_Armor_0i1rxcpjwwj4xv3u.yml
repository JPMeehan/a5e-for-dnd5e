      <p>At level 14, your Graven Armor is not merely dead&mdash;it is undead.
      The reanimated armor provides you with the following benefits while you
      have temporary hit points from it:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p><strong><em>Bone Weapon. </em></strong>You can shape weapons made from
      bone out of the armor. While you are raging, as a bonus action, you may
      spend 2 Graven Armor temporary hit points to manifest a bone weapon.
      Choose a melee weapon you are proficient with. A weapon of that type made
      from bone appears in your hand. Attacks made with this weapon deal an
      additional die of damage when used with your Deadly Strikes. The weapon
      lasts until you let go of it or until your rage ends.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p><strong><em>Morbid Terror. </em></strong>Your Death Mask becomes more
      powerful. Creatures that fail their saves now become Frightened, and
      creatures that fail by more than 5 now suffer a mild heart attack. A
      creature that suffers a mild heart attack must immediately make a
      Constitution save against your maneuver DC or acquire 2 levels of fatigue
      and be stunned until the end of its next turn, then becomes frightened for
      the remaining duration. A creature that succeeds on this save suffers no
      fatigue, but is still stunned.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p><strong><em>Rotted Wings. </em></strong>You can spend 5 Graven Armor
      temporary hit points to manifest a ghastly pair of leathery wings as a
      bonus action, which grants you a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
      The wings persist until you reabsorb them as a bonus action (which
      increases your remaining Graven Armor temporary hit points by 5), or you
      take enough damage to end your Graven Armor or dismiss it.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>If you do not have enough Graven Armor temporary hit points to spend on
      Bone Weapon or Rotted Wings, you may not use them.</p>

      <p><strong>Foundry Note:</strong> This is a complicated ability, these
      notes should guide you in their expected use in the system.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <blockquote><em>Bone Weapon:</em> Since there is no way for us to know
      what type of weapon a character will create with this ability nor can we
      automate the damage since it is based on the weapons damage, not the
      creatures Deadly Strikes damage. The player will have to add a weaapon of
      the type they want to make and then updated the damage on that weapon to
      be doubled. Also make sure to add the weapon properties for Bone since the
      weapon is made out of that material:&nbsp;<em>Flaw</em> and
      <em>Lightweight</em>. Upon activation of the Create Bone Weapon Action you
      will need to apply the damage to the character in order to remove the 2
      temp hp required to activate the ability.</blockquote>

      </li>

      <li>

      <blockquote><em>Morbid Terror:&nbsp;</em>Once you reach this level you
      will use the Use Morbid Terror Action to activate your Death Masks feature
      instead of the Death Mask feature itself. It is set to roll both the
      Wisdom Saving Throw for Death Masks and the Constitution Saving Throw
      added by Morbid Terror. Do not use the Constitution Saving Throw unless
      they fail their Wisdom Saving Throw by 5 or more and then apply the
      effects accordingly.</blockquote>

      </li>

      <li>

      <blockquote><em>Rotted Wings:</em> If you already have a Flying Speed
      greater than your walking speed the effect for this ability will not be
      applied since it isn't an additional speed on top of whatever you have. In
      addition, when activating the feature you will need to apply the damage
      rolled to remove the Temp HP that this feature requires. When you use the
      Absorb Armor Action the wings they will roll Temp HP of the same amount as
      the cost so you can reapply that to your character if your Armor is still
      intact.</blockquote>
