      <p>At level 14, your Graven Armor is not merely deadâ€”it is undead. The
      reanimated armor provides you with the following benefits while you have
      temporary hit points from it:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong><em>Bone
      Weapon. </em></strong>You can shape weapons made from bone out of the
      armor. While you are raging, as a bonus action, you may spend 2 Graven
      Armor temporary hit points to manifest a bone weapon. Choose a melee
      weapon you are proficient with. A weapon of that type made from bone
      appears in your hand. Attacks made with this weapon deal an additional die
      of damage when used with your Deadly Strikes. The weapon lasts until you
      let go of it or until your rage ends.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Morbid
      Terror. </em></strong>Your Death Mask becomes more powerful. Creatures
      that fail their saves now become Frightened, and creatures that fail by
      more than 5 now suffer a mild heart attack. A creature that suffers a mild
      heart attack must immediately make a Constitution save against your
      maneuver DC or acquire 2 levels of fatigue and be stunned until the end of
      its next turn, then becomes frightened for the remaining duration. A
      creature that succeeds on this save suffers no fatigue, but is still
      stunned.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Rotted Wings. </em></strong>You can
      spend 5 Graven Armor temporary hit points to manifest a ghastly pair of
      leathery wings as a bonus action, which grants you a flying speed equal to
      your walking speed. The wings persist until you reabsorb them as a bonus
      action (which increases your remaining Graven Armor temporary hit points
      by 5), or you take enough damage to end your Graven Armor or dismiss
      it.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you do not have enough Graven Armor
      temporary hit points to spend on Bone Weapon or Rotted Wings, you may not
      use them.</p><p><br></p>
