      <p>At 2nd level you may expend your Channel Divinity when you fail an
      ability check. You may re-roll that check and gain an expertise die on the
      re-roll. You must take the new result.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, at 2nd level you may choose a channel divinity option
      from another cleric archetype that is granted at 2nd level in place of the
      above option. You gain that channel divinity option instead. Once this
      choice has been made it cannot be changed.</p>
