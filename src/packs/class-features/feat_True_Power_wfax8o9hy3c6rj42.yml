      <p>At 18th level your transformation has finally reached its peak. You
      gain one of the following abilities based on what you chose for your
      twisted mutation.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Stonegaze</strong>: Your stone eye twisted mutation becomes a
      60ft cone.</li>

      <li><strong>Chimeric</strong>: Your fly speed increases to 120ft and you
      gain a Wing Buffet attack as an action. All creatures in a 20ft cone must
      make a Strength save or take 4d8+Str bludgeoning damage and be knocked
      prone and pushed 15ft away from you. On a successful save they take half
      damage and are not knocked prone.</li>

      <li><strong>Mimic</strong>: You may use your transmogrifier twisted
      mutation to become an animated object up to huge size.</li>
