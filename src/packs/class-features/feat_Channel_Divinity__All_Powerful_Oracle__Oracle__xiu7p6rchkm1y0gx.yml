      <p>Beginning at 17th level, your ability to see from the perspective of
      another using Channel Divinity reaches its ultimate form. When using this
      feature, you become blinded and deafened to your surroundings for up to a
      number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier, sensing instead through a
      creature you name. As long as the creature is alive and on the same plane
      of existence, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see
      and hear everything the creature sees and hears. </p><p>In addition, you
      are also able to access all of the creature’s memories and knowledge
      related to a single object, place, person, or subject. The subject and
      place must be somewhat specific (you may not simply access their knowledge
      of “history” for example, but you may access their knowledge on “the
      history of dragons’ uses in warfare”.) Similarly, you may<br>gain their
      knowledge of a single city, building, or 5-mile-square patch of
      wilderness, but not an entire continent or region.</p><p>You cannot see
      through the eyes of a blinded creature, or hear through the ears of a
      deafened creature. If the creature is dead or protected from divination
      magic this feature has no effect. An unconscious creature automatically
      fails its saving throw and you may hear what it hears and access its
      knowledge. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this feature for
      24 hours. <br><br></p>
