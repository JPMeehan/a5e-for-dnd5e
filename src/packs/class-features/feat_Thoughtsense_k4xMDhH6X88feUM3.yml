      dir="ltr">You are subtly aware of the presence of nearby thinking
      creatures.&nbsp; You can use an action to scan for thinking creatures
      within 30 ft that you can&rsquo;t see.&nbsp; This can only detect
      creatures with an intelligence of 4 or higher and that speak or understand
      at least one language.&nbsp; If you detect the presence of a creature in
      this way, you gain an expertise die on Perception checks made to locate
      them. The ability penetrates most barriers but is blocked by 2 feet of
      stone, 2 inches of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You also have an expertise die on perception checks made to
      avoid being surprised by qualifying creatures.</p>
