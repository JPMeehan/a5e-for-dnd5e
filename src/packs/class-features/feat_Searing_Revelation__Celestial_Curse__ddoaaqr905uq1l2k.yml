      incapacitated.</p><p>The curse has the following
      effects:</p><ul><li><p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature,
      it takes an additional 1d4 radiant damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at

      by this amount.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t
      use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
