      <p>At 14th level your power grows by leaps and bounds. You gain one of the
      following abilities based on your choice of flesh and bone.</p>

      <p><strong>Bale Eye</strong>: Your bonded power grows significantly. You
      may now use your baleful gaze in a 30ft cone or a 15ft radius around
      yourself. In addition, creatures that roll a natural 1 on their saving
      throw against your bonded power become petrified for 1 minute.</p>
