      <p>Beginning at 3rd level when you take this archetype, you become
      proficient with the tools of the poisoner’s art. You gain an expertise die
      to checks made with the poisoner’s kit, and if you fail a check to harvest
      poisons, you do not risk poisoning yourself. When you successfully use
      your poisoner’s kit to harvest poisons, you harvest additional doses equal
      to half your proficiency bonus. </p><p>You also are especially adept at
      slipping substances onto innocuous items and into food and drink. You make
      all Stealth, Deception, and Sleight of Hand checks to conceal poison,
      drugs, potions, or similar substances in food, drink, or on unattended
      inanimate objects with advantage.</p>
