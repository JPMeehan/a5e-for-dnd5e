    value: >-
      <p>At level 3 when you take this archetype, you become especially adept at
      harvesting poisons. You gain proficiency with the poisoner’s kit and on a
      failed check, you are not poisoned, though you still do not collect any
      poison. On a successful check with the poisoner’s kit, you harvest an
      additional number of doses of basic poison equal to half your proficiency
      bonus (rounded down).</p>
