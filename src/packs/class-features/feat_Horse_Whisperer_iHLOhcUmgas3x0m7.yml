      <p>You share a kinship with the strong and the swift, and you easily ride
      together and share each other's burdens. You gain an expertise die on
      Animal Handling checks regarding horses and other pack animals.</p>

      <p>In addition, you can spend 10 minutes bonding with any mount. You treat
      mounts you bond with in this way as if they had the loyal and willing
      mount traits while you are bonded with them. When you bond with a mount
      you lose any previous bonds with other mounts made in this way.</p>
