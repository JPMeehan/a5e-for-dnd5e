      <p>You gain an expertise die on Investigation checks. You have a sense for
      finding hidden things. You can spend a minute observing an area. If there
      are tricks, traps, secret doors, or other unusual features of a nonmagical
      nature within 30 feet of you on an unobscured surface you can see, you
      know something nearby is worth investigating, but not what or where it is.
      You canâ€™t use Sense for Secrets twice on the same area.</p>
