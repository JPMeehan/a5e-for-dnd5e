      dir="ltr">You can spit out an antidote for a specific poison after
      identifying it and resisting its effects. To identify it you may use an
      action to touch and taste a small amount of the poison and make a saving
      throw against the poison with advantage. On a success you produce and spit
      out enough antidote doses to heal [[/r 1d4]] poisoned creatures. On a
      failure you suffer the effects of the poison, but after 1 minute you can
      still produce 1 dose of the antidote.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The antidote loses its potency and can no longer counteract
      the poison after 24 hours.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Once you use this feature, you may not do so again until you
      complete a long rest.</p>
