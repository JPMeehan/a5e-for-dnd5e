      <p>At 11th level, your connections enable you to stretch your funds when
      building religious strongholds. Your costs to build, purchase, or upgrade
      a sacred grove or temple stronghold are reduced by 25%. In addition, when
      you acquire a stronghold at level 13, you may decide to have that
      stronghold be a keep, mansion, sacred grove, or temple.</p>
