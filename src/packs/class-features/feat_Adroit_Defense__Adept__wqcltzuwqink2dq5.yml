      <p>At 1st level, choose one of the following options.</p>

      <p><strong>Agile Defense.</strong>&nbsp;While you aren&rsquo;t wearing
      armor and not using a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity
      modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Brutal Defense. </strong>You are proficient with light armor.
      While you are wearing light armor, you can use Strength instead of
      Dexterity when calculating your Armor Class. If you know the Adept Speed
      practiced technique or any other technique that has it as a prerequisite,
      you can use them while wearing light armor.</p>
