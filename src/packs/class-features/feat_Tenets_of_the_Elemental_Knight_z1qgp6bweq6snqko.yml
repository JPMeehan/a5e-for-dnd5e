      <p>Elemental knights hold similar tenets, reflecting the noble pursuit of
      the scholarly knight.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Live Responsibly.</strong> Your life has consequences. Seek
      righteousness in all things.</li>

      <li><strong>Study Courageously.</strong> Learn everything you can. No fact
      of the matter has power over the faith in your heart.</li>

      <li><strong>Serve With Integrity.</strong> Always question why and for
      whom you lift your blade. Always back the true cause of justice.</li>

      <li><strong>Act Decisively.</strong> Build contingencies and outplan
      enemies, but never let these distract you from your chance at
      victory.</li>

      </ul>
