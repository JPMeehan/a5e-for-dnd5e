      <p>You have an ear for interesting events, places, and people of the past.
      You can always use Constitution when making History checks and gain an
      expertise die when the subject has something to do with war, battle, or
      martial prowess&nbsp;In addition, your reputation means that people assume
      that you want to know the history (or perhaps gossip) of the settlement
      you’re visiting. When you are at a tavern or social gathering they are
      likely to approach you with tales of the baroness’ last stand 50 years
      ago, or mention ‘history in the making’ in the form of the Duke’s child
      being rumored to be a werewolf. Mechanical bonuses are at the Narrator’s
      discretion but could include gaining an expertise die on Insight checks
      made against a particular NPC, or advantage on checks when seeking out a
      local tomb.</p>
