      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the Beast Friend
      knack if you donâ€™t already know it, and the beast can be of CR 1/4 or
      less. In addition, whenever the beast rolls initiative, it gains a number
      of temporary hit points equal to your level multiplied by your proficiency
      bonus, and its Armor Class increases by an amount equal to your
      proficiency bonus.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the
      beast to take an action on its turn. If you order the beast to attack, it
      adds your proficiency bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>
