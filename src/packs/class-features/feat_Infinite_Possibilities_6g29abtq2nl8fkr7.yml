      <p>Starting at 18th level your understanding of your bonded artifact
      allows you to surpass even its already formidable intended capabilities.
      When you learn a spell using your enigma tinkering feature, you may select
      spells from any class spell list, instead of only selecting from the
      wielder spell list. Spells you learn in this way are treated as wielder
      spells for you.</p>
