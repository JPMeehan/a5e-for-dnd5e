      <p dir="ltr">Also at 10th level, you gain a connection to the fires of
      Heaven or the flames of Hell. Choose one of the following options when you
      gain this feature:</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Heavenly Fire</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">When you deal fire damage or radiant damage, at your option
      you can have that damage dealt be half fire damage and half radiant
      damage. <br>In addition, you may choose to have your fire spells heal
      rather than harming, restoring hit points equal to half the damage they
      would normally do. You may use this feature a number of times equal to
      half your proficiency bonus and regain all uses upon finishing a long
      rest.</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Hellfire</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">When you deal fire damage or necrotic damage, at your option
      you can have that damage dealt be half fire damage and half necrotic
      damage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you may have your flames burn away the life
      essence of creatures. When you deal fire damage to a creature, you can use
      this feature (no action required) to decrease the creature&rsquo;s maximum
      hit points by an amount equal to the fire damage it dealt. You can use
      this feature a number of times per day equal to half your proficiency
      bonus, and you regain all uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>
