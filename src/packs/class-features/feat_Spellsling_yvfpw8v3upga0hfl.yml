      dir="ltr">At 5th level you gain the unique ability to bind your magical
      spells to your ranged weaponry. When you throw a weapon or fire a piece of
      ammunition not augmented by Arcane Ammunition you can instead imbue a
      spell into your arrow and fire it as an action.&nbsp;</p><p
      dir="ltr">Spells cast in this way replace any saving throw or spell attack
      roll against the primary target with the ranged weapon attack. Saving
      throws on subsequent rounds, or by creatures in an area affected by the
      spell, against spells cast in this way are made against your maneuver DC.
      Spells which strike an area use your target as the center of the
      spell&rsquo;s area.</p><p dir="ltr">Spells which utilize multiple attacks
      require a separate piece of ammunition for each attack roll.</p>
