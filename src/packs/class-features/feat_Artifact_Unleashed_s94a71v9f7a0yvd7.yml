      <p>At 20th level, your artifact&rsquo;s power has manifested fully and you
      can access its power unfettered and unrestrained. You gain benefits
      determined by your bonded artifact&rsquo;s form:</p>

      <h2>Unleashed Weapon of Power</h2>

      <p>Attacks you make with your weapon of power ignore all resistances and
      immunities. In addition, once per turn when you hit a target with your
      weapon of power you may choose to expend one artifact charge to deal an
      additional 4d6 force damage.</p>

      <h2>Unleashed Armor of Power</h2>

      <p>While wearing your armor of power, as an action you can project a
      shield of impenetrable force that protects you until the start of your
      next turn by expending three artifact charges. While this shield is
      projected you are immune to all damage types.</p>

      <h2>Unleashed Font of Power</h2>

      <p>You may cast up to 3 wielder spells with your font of power using a
      single action so long as each spell has a casting time of action or bonus
      action. You may resolve these spells in any order.</p>
