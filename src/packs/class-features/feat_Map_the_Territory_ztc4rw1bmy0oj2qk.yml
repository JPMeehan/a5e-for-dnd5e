      <p dir="ltr">At 3rd level, you learn the tools necessary to help others
      pass through the unknown territory you routinely traverse. You gain
      proficiency with Navigator&rsquo;s Tools and Cartographer&rsquo;s
      Tools.</p><p>In addition, you can draw a quick map in 10 minutes with a DC
      15 Cartographer&rsquo;s Tools check. On a success, the map gives those
      navigating its area (which can be up to 10 miles by 10 miles) advantage on
      their Survival or Navigator&rsquo;s Tools checks to avoid major hazards,
      find food and shelter, and pass safely through without becoming lost. On a
      failed check, your map is an illegible mess and provides no benefit.</p>
