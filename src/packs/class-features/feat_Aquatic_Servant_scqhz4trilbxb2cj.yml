    value: >-
      <p>As an action you can conjure your aquatic servant, a water elemental
      which emerges from a body of water you can see within 30 feet, such as a
      Tiny-sized puddle or a Large-sized fountain. The aquatic servant takes the
      form of a beast, the CR of which is no higher than your level divided by
      6, and the size of which is no larger than the body of water from which
      you called it. The servant retains the elemental creature type, and it can
      appear either as the beast it emulates or as a water elemental molded into
      that shape. It takes its turn immediately after yours, and it obeys your
      mental commands.</p>

      <p>You must concentrate on this effect to maintain it, as though
      concentrating on a spell. The aquatic servant remains in your service for
      1 hour, or until you no longer concentrate on this effect.</p>

      <p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you
      complete a long rest.</p>
