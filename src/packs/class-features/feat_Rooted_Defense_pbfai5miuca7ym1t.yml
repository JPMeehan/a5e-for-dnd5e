      <p>At 7th level, while you are standing on a solid surface, you can use a
      bonus action to root yourself in place. While rooted, your Speed becomes
      0, but whenever an effect would move you or knock you&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">prone</span>, you ignore that effect, and the
      ground within 10 feet of you becomes&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">difficult terrain</span>. In addition, while you
      are rooted, a creature you hit with a&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">melee weapon attack</span> must make a Strength
      save against a DC of 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the
      creature&rsquo;s Speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. You
      can end your rooted state as an action.</p>
