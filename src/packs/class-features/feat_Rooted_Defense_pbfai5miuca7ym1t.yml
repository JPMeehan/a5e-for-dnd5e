      <p>At 7th level, while you are standing on a solid surface, you can use a
      bonus action to root yourself in place. While rooted, your Speed becomes
      0, but whenever an effect would move you or knock you&nbsp;prone</span>,
      you ignore that effect, and the ground within 10 feet of you
      becomes&nbsp;difficult terrain. In addition, while you are rooted, a
      creature you hit with a&nbsp;<span>melee weapon attack must make a
      Strength save against a DC of 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failure,
      the creature&rsquo;s Speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.
      You can end your rooted state as an action.</p>
