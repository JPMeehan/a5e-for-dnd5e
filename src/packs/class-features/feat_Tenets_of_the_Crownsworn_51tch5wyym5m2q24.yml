      <p>Regardless of the the ruler or nation they serve all crownsworn hold
      similar tenets.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>My Country, Right or Wrong. </strong>Your devotion to your
      ruler and/or nation must be absolute and you must defend their honor in
      all things. Your cannot be led astray by the whims of fickle morality, for
      you serve something greater, a legacy that stretches beyond a single
      action, moment, or even ruler.</li>

      <li><strong>Heavy is the Head that Wears the Crown.</strong> If you are a
      ruler you are bound by burdens and responsibilities heavier than any
      subject could realize. You must bear them dutifully and without complaint,
      or if sworn to a leader&rsquo;s service do all you can to aid them in
      their task and lighten their load.</li>

      <li><strong>Your Life Belongs to your People Now.</strong> Do not
      heedlessly endanger yourself or recklessly throw your life away for it
      does not belong to you. It belongs to your liege, as theirs belongs to
      their subjects. Seek not personal glory, but only to glorify those you are
      beholden to.</li>
