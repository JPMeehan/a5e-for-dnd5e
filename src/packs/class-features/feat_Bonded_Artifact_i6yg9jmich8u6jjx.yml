    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level you acquire a magical artifact that acts as the source of
      your power. Your artifact is bonded to you and any creature other than you
      that attempts to wear, wield, or otherwise use your artifact can only
      utilize it as its mundane equivalent. Artifacts are typically
      indestructible but if somehow your artifact is broken, destroyed, or
      separated from you, you always magically know what direction it is in and
      you can magically repair it once you finish a long rest with it.</p>

      <p>Your bonded artifact can take many different forms, choose one of the
      following options when you first gain this feature, this choice cannot be
      changed.</p>

      <h2>Weapon of Power</h2>

      <p>Your bonded artifact is a simple or martial weapon of your choice. You
      gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with your bonded artifact.
      This bonus increases by 1 when you reach your 5th Wielder level (+2), 11th
      Wielder level (+3), and 17th Wielder level (+4).</p>

      <h2>Armor of Power</h2>

      <p>Your bonded artifact is a suit of armor, outfit, article of clothing,
      or an item that is otherwise worn. While wearing your bonded artifact you
      are magically protected and your armor class equals 10 + your spellcasting
      ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. You can use a shield and still
      gain this benefit. In addition, you add the spell shield to your list of
      known wielder spells.</p>

      <h2>Font of Power</h2>

      <p>Your object of power takes the form of a wand, talisman, staff, or any
      other object that could normally be used as a spellcasting focus. You add
      your proficiency bonus to the number of artifact charges your bonded
      artifact has.</p>
