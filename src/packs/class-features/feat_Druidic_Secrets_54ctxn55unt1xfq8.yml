      <p>You&rsquo;re adept at covertly performing druidic magic without
      attracting attention. When you cast a druid spell you may choose to do so
      utilizing silent and subtle Druidic motions and signs in place of both the
      spell&rsquo;s seen and vocalized components, gestures that creatures which
      can speak Druidic are aware of. Once you cast a druid spell in this way,
      you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
