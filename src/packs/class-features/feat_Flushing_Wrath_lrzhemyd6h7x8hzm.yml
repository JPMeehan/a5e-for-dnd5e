  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you or a friendly creature in the range of your Commanding
      Presence ability takes the Attack action for the first time against a
      creature each turn, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw against a
      DC of 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. If it fails, it
      must use its reaction to move at least half its movement speed away from
      its current position. This movement is considered a use of the Disengage
      action and as such does not normally provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
