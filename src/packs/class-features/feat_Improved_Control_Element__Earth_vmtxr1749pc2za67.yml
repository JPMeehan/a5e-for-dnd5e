      dir="ltr">At 13th level, you gain greater control of your elemental
      affinities. The range of your Control Elements ability increases to 60
      feet. You can now perform the following effects as an action, or sustain
      an effect from the previous round as an action.</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can move elemental material weighing
      up to 50 lbs per elementalist level. You can move multiple objects
      together, as long as they weigh less than your total limit together and
      fit within a 15 by 15 foot cube.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You can target an elemental creature
      within range that is no larger than Huge size. The target makes a Strength
      save against your spell save DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction
      and is restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You
      cannot move a target beyond your 60 foot control range, or else it is
      released from your hold.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Earth can be used to grab creatures of up
      to Huge size. Choose a creature within range. The target makes a Strength
      save against your spell DC or is restrained until it breaks free. It can
      turn 15 by 15 foot sections of stone or earth ground into difficult
      terrain.</p>
