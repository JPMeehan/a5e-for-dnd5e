      <p>At your option, a water vehicle you ride gains resistance to
      bludgeoning, lightning, piercing, slashing, and thunder damage. You also
      gain advantage on Perception and Insight checks to detect threats to the
      vehicle or its occupants. Spells you cast that restore hit points can also
      target the vehicle to repair damage, even if the vehicle would not
      normally be a valid target for the spell.</p>
