      <p>At 9th level, you&rsquo;ve learned to use your relic&rsquo;s power to
      maintain your magic when your own focus lapses. Whenever you would lose
      concentration on a wielder spell due to failing a concentration check, you
      can expend one of your relic&rsquo;s charges to automatically succeed on
      that concentration check instead.</p>
