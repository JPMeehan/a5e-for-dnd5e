      <p>At 14th level, your embrace of death dealing has made you a figure of
      menace and horror, and you are nearly impossible to sway from your task.
      While you are raging, you are immune to the confused and frightened
      conditions. Also while raging, you have advantage on saves to avoid the
      charmed, rattled, and stunned conditions. You can now use
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.5u9ryymp8zndum2i]{Headsman&rsquo;s
      Cut},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.dhbdn3wj7ejjcb9m]{Public
      Spectacle} , and
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.hk8hvy3pz3kuxnva]{Cut
      Down} with any melee weapon that deals slashing damage. You can still only
      apply the bonus damage to a single weapon. Creatures that fail their save
      against Public Spectacle now suffer a level of strife in addition to the
      other effects. If this would result in the creature having more levels of
      strife than your proficiency bonus, it does not gain the level of
      strife.</p>

      <p>In addition, you have dealt so much death that it is reluctant to
      collect you. If you would acquire the Doomed condition, you may make a DC
      15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you do not acquire the
      condition and you recover a level of fatigue and a level of strife from
      the thrill of cheating death.</p>
