      <p>At 10th level, the potency of your faith increases. Choose one of the
      following:</p><h2>Divine Intervention</h2><p>Beginning at 10th level, you
      can use an action to call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when
      your need is great. Describe the assistance you seek and roll percentile
      dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your
      deity intervenes. The Narrator chooses the nature of the intervention; the
      effect of any cleric spell or cleric archetype spell would be appropriate.
      If your deity intervenes, you can&rsquo;t use this feature again for 7
      days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long
      rest.</p><p>After each failed divine intervention roll, add 1 to the
      number required to succeed until it is a success, at which point it resets
      to your cleric level or below.</p><p>At 20th level, your call for
      intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p><h2>Imminent
      Turning</h2><p>A powerful connection to the life force of your greater
      entity extends the range of your Turn Undead. You may now Turn Undead from
      up to 60 feet away.</p><h2>Master Ritualist</h2><p>Careful study of your
      holy texts has made you intimately familiar with all of your ritual
      spells. You may cast any ritual spell on the cleric spell list you could
      cast as a ritual, whether or not you have it prepared.</p><h2>Prayer of
      Protection</h2><p>After each long rest choose one damage type from the
      following list: cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, psychic, radiant,
      or thunder. You gain resistance to this damage type until the end of your
      next long rest</p>
