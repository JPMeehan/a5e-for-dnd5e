      <p>Also at 10th level, your supernatural awareness sharpens. You can see
      into the ethereal plane at all times and creatures of the celestial, fey,
      fiend, and undead types that are invisible are clearly visible to you. You
      also have advantage on checks and saving throws to penetrate the disguises
      (magical or mundane) of creatures of these types.</p>
