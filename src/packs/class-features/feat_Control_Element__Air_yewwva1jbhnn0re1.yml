      dir="ltr">In addition to creating damaging blasts of elemental energy,
      elementalists are able to command and control elemental material at a
      distance. As an action, an elementalist can create effects at a range of
      30 feet, manipulating ambient elemental material to create any of the
      following effects. You must possess the proper elemental affinity to
      control an element.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Elemental material weighing up to 5 lbs
      per elementalist level can be moved up to 30 feet.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Elemental material up to a cubic foot can
      be reshaped (such as ice or stone), using your power in place of any
      required tool proficiencies. Shapes can be made in amorphous elements
      (like air, fire, or water), but the shapes only hold for as long as you
      spend an action.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Air can be used to create light breezes,
      enough to ruffle and move material like paper and leaves, blow out tiny
      fires, or clear or create smells. You can also move air into a
      creature&rsquo;s lungs, allowing it to breathe for 1 minute in an
      environment it otherwise couldn&rsquo;t. You can use air to perform the
      Knockdown and Shove maneuvers against medium or smaller creatures within
      range.</p>
