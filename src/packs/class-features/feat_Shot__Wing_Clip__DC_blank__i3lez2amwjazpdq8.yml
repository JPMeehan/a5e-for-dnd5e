      <p>You aim for your targetâ€™s wings. The target makes a Dexterity saving
      throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, its flying speed is reduced
      by half until healed. Creatures who are currently flying when this saving
      throw is failed immediately plummet 60 feet down and take falling damage
      as normal.</p>
