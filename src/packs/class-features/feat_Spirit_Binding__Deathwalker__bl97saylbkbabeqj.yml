      <p>At 6th level you gain the ability to bind the spirits of the recently
      departed to your service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span></p><p>When you kill a creature targeted by your Death Curse or
      under the effects of one of your warlock spells, you can resurrect it as a
      <strong>Specter</strong> or a <strong>Shadow</strong> (your choice) into
      an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The creature rolls its own initiative,
      has its own turns, and obeys your verbal commands. It retains no memory
      from its life. The creature disappears after 1 minute, when you are
      knocked unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>At 15th
      level, you can have your patron conjure for you either a
      <strong>Banshee</strong> or a <strong>Wraith</strong> instead.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>Once you have used this
      feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
