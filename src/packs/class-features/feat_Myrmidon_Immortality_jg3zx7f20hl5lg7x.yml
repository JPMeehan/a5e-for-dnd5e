      <p>At 15th level, the ferocity of your elemental fury knows no bounds. If
      you are reduced to 0 hp, you can choose to remain at 1 hp and make an
      Elemental Blast attack as a reaction against the creature or object that
      reduced you to 0 hp if it is within range. Once you use this ability, you
      cannot use it again until you complete a short or a long rest.</p>
