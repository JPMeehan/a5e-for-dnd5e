      <p>At 15th level, the ferocity of your elemental fury knows no bounds. If
      you are reduced to 0 hp, you can choose to remain at 1 hp and make an
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.uit7l3mc64l5h8h1]{Elemental
      Blast} attack as a reaction against the creature or object that reduced
      you to 0 hp if it is within range. Once you use this ability, you cannot
      use it again until you complete a short or a long rest.</p>
