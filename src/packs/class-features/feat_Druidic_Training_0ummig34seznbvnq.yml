      <p>All druids are taught to commune with nature, to become a conduit for
      natural power, and to maintain the secrets of their druid circle. Also at
      1st level, you gain proficiency with Nature, and you learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.5o1rvwzxmsh5ji9i]{Druidcraft}
      cantrip (this does not count against your total cantrips known).&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the
      language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this
      language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
      message&rsquo;s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check
      but can&rsquo;t decipher it without magic.</p>
