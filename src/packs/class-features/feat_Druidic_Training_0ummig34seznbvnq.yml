      <p>All druids are taught to commune with nature, to become a conduit for
      natural power, and to maintain the secrets of their druid circle. Also at
      1st level, you gain proficiency with Nature, and you learn the druidcraft
      cantrip (this does not count against your total cantrips
      known).&nbsp;</p><p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You
      can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others
      who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
      message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but
      can’t decipher it without magic.</p>
