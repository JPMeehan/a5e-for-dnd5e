      <p>You are adept at using your studies to advise others, as well as
      yourself, for there are few that share your burden of knowledge. You may
      spend inspiration to allow yourself or another creature to regain a use of
      an ability with limited uses per long rest. This cannot be used to restore
      spell slots, nor can a single creature benefit from this more than once
      per long rest. You also gain inspiration anytime you finish a long rest if
      you do not already have it.</p>
