      <p>At level 13, you learn to place magical sensors by spending spell
      energy. As an action, you can expend a spell slot of first-level or higher
      and touch a solid surface to create a magical sensor about the size of
      your fist. The sensor is not quite invisible, but is difficult to spot,
      requiring a Perception or Investigation check against your spell save DC
      to notice. A sensor has 1 hit point and an AC of 10.</p><p>&nbsp;Once the
      sensor is placed, it lasts indefinitely. As long as you are on the same
      plane as the sensor, you can spend an action to look through the sensor as
      if you were looking through the eyes of a familiar, becoming blind to your
      own senses for the duration. The sensors can transmit sights, but not
      sounds, smells, or other sensory information.</p><p>The sensor benefits
      from your dark eye features. You may have a number of sensors in existence
      at the same time equal to your proficiency bonus. If you create a new one
      while at your maximum, you choose which previously-created sensor
      dissipates.&nbsp;</p>
