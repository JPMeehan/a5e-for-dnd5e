      <p>Also at 6th level, you gain the ability to function as a conduit for
      the spirits of the restless departed to speak through. As an action, you
      may invite a haunting spirit or spectral undead to use your body to
      communicate through. The creature enters your body and gains control of
      it, but you remain aware and can attempt to expel a visitor that is
      abusing its privileges. Make a check at a bonus equal to your proficiency
      bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier against a DC equal to the
      creature&rsquo;s CR + 10. If you fail, the creature retains control of
      your body and can act normally. You may repeat this check next round, but
      if you fail, you can&rsquo;t try again for 1 minute, then 10 minutes, then
      an hour, and finally a day. Once the interval reaches a day, you can only
      make checks every day to remove the unwanted presence. If you succeed, the
      creature is forcibly expelled from your body and is stunned for a
      round.</p>

      <p>If a creature forcibly possesses you, you may use this feature to try
      to expel the unwanted visitor. Against an uninvited guest, you have
      advantage on the checks and can make a new attempt every round.</p>
