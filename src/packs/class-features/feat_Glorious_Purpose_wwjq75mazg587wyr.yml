      <p>When you agree to undertake a quest that specifically fulfills the
      tenets of your herald archetype, you gain proficiency with a skill that
      will be crucial to completing that quest. The skill is chosen by the
      Narrator. If you are already proficient with the skill, you gain an
      expertise die instead. The benefits of this divine lesson do not change
      until the quest has been completed.</p>
