      <p>At 2nd level you may expend your Channel Divinity when you fail an
      ability check. You may re-roll that check and gain an expertise die on the
      re-roll. You must take the new result.</p><p>Alternatively, at 2nd level
      you may choose a channel divinity option from another cleric archetype
      that is granted at 2nd level in place of the above option. You gain that
      channel divinity option instead. Once this choice has been made it cannot
      be changed.</p>
