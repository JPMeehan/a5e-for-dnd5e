      <p>At 14th level, whenever you reduce a creature with blood to 0 hit
      points in an outdoor setting, you can summon a corrupted creature of grave
      earth and necrotic vines from a space adjacent to it. Treat this as a free
      casting of the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.633bpp281x35cz6t]{Conjure
      Elemental}</em>&nbsp;spell cast with an effective 6th-level spell slot,
      except it can only conjure an earth elemental, the creature&rsquo;s bonus
      damage is necrotic, and it has the undead type in addition to the
      elemental type. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to
      your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), you can&rsquo;t do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
