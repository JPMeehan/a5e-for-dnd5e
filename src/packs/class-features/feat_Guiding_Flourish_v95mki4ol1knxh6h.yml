      <p>When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can try to trick it
      into moving. If it fails a Dexterity saving throw , it moves up to 10 feet
      in a direction of your choice. This movement doesnâ€™t provoke opportunity
      attacks . If this movement would cause it to take damage (such as by
      falling or entering fire), the creature has advantage on this saving
      throw.</p>
