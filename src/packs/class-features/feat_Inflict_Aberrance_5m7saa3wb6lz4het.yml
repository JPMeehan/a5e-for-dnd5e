      <p>At 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can inflict
      aberrance upon it. It takes 10d10 psychic or radiant damage (your choice)
      as its mind or body is overloaded with the sensation of pure magic. Once
      you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have finished
      a long rest.</p>
