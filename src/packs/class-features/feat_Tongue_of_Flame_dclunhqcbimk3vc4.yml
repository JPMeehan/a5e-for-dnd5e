      <p dir="ltr">At 2nd level when you select this archetype, you gain the
      blessing of the tongue of fire. You become proficient with the Primordial
      language and its Ignan dialect, and can read, speak, and sign them. You
      also gain proficiency in the Insight skill.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You also gain the power to burn through misunderstandings.
      You may cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ef9fuzf8xcja2p7c]{Tongues}
      without using a spell slot and without components. Once you have used this
      feature, you may not do so again until you have finished a long rest. At
      8th level, you may use this feature after finishing a short or long rest,
      and at 14th level, you are considered to have tongues active at all
      times.</p>
