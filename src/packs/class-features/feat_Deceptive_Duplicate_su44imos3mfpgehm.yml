      <p>At 6th level you can summon an identical duplicate of yourself within
      30 feet. This duplicate lasts for 1 minute. You can cast spells as if they
      originated from the duplicate's space, though you must still see the
      target if necessary. As a bonus action you can move the duplicate up to 30
      feet, and as an action you can swap places with the duplicate. Once you
      have used this ability you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
