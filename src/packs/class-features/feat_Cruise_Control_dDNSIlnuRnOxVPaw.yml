      dir="ltr">You can spend 1 sorcery point to touch a vehicle and pilot it
      along your intended course for up to 8 hours while you rest. During this
      time you still gain the benefits of completing the rest. Living creatures
      that are required to pull, push, or otherwise propel a vehicle (e.g the
      oxen for an ox-drawn wagon) are considered to be resting as well.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The vehicle will follow the path you predetermined (e.g.
      road, waterway, or heading towards a destination) but will not avoid
      obstacles that you were unaware of prior to taking your rest. For example
      if you are aware of a large pothole on the road ahead or rocky outcrop in
      the sea, the vehicle will go around it, but if you are unaware that a
      bridge further on has been burned down or that a kraken has recently
      surfaced along your ocean route, the vehicle will make no attempt to
      change course.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You cannot stop the vehicle, use a vehicle action, or change
      course without interrupting your rest.</p>
