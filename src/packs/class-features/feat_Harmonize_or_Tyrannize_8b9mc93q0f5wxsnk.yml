      <p>At 15th level you choose to harmonize with nature or to harness it.
      Choose one of the following:&nbsp;</p><h3
      class="Indent1">Harmonize</h3><p>During a&nbsp;short rest&nbsp;you may
      choose to meditate and harmonize with your surroundings. If you do, at the
      end of your rest you attune to the area in a 5-mile radius around you. You
      magically know what types of creatures are present in your attuned area,
      their approximate numbers, and if there are any magics disturbing the
      natural order in your attuned area. While in your attuned area, you have
      advantage on Nature, Perception, and Survival checks, and&nbsp;blindsight
      out to a range of 30 feet. Once attuned to an area, you remain attuned for
      the next 24 hours. You can only attune to one area at a
      time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3
      class="Indent1">TYRANNIZE</h3><p>You draw upon nature&rsquo;s power to
      become a prime example of one of its children. Whenever you assume a wild
      shape you may choose to assume the apex form of that wild shape. An apex
      form is one size category larger than the creature&rsquo;s normal size
      category (maximum Gargantuan) and any attack made by an apex form wild
      shape deals an extra 1d8 damage. In addition, while in an apex form wild
      shape you gain an&nbsp;expertise die&nbsp;on Strength, Dexterity, and
      Constitution checks and&nbsp;saving throws .</p>
