      <p>Also at third level your study of anatomy and biology grants an almost
      supernatural ability to heal. You have a number of doctor dice equal to
      your scholar level. The die is a d8. You may expend one of these as an
      action to heal a target for 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier, and a
      particular target may only be healed in this way once per short or long
      rest.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may spend 10 minutes tending to, bandaging, and/or
      otherwise treating someone and heal them for 1d8 x your proficiency bonus
      + your Intelligence modifier, with no limit to how often you may do so
      beyond the time required and the number of doctor dice you possess. You
      may also expend both a doctor die and a hit die as an action to replicate
      the effects of a *lesser restoration* spell. You regain all expended
      doctor dice when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>At level 10 your doctor dice increase to 1d10s and you may expend a
      doctor die and a hit die to replicate a *greater restoration* spell. A
      creature may only benefit from this greater restoration once per long
      rest.</p>
