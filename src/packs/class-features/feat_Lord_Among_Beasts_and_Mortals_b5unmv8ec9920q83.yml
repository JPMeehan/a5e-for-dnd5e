      <p>As the mighty dragon guards its lair, so too do you establish your home
      wherever you roam. Starting at 6th level, when you start a short or long
      rest in an area that is not within 1 mile of an established settlement,
      you can spend 10 minutes in communion with the land to protect your camp
      until you finish your rest. Beasts who approach within 100 feet of your
      camp become docile and placid, refusing to attack you or your companions.
      Additionally, friendly creatures in your camp gain advantage on Perception
      checks to spot danger, and on Intimidation checks against
      intruders.</p><p>If you repeat this effect every day in the same location
      for a year, the range of the aura increases to 500 feet and the effect
      becomes permanent. When you have a permanent lair, your Prestige increases
      by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. You can only have one
      location prepared in this way at a time, and it fades if you are ever away
      from your lair for a year or longer. If you die, the effect fades after
      2d10 days.</p>
