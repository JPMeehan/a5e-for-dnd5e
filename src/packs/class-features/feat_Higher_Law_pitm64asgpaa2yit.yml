      <p>When you take this archetype at 1st level, you learn the proper methods
      for tapping into the primordial rules behind everything. Choose one of the
      following options:</p><h3><strong>Balanced Curse</strong></h3><p>You can
      use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30
      feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you
      die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following
      effects:</p><ul><li><p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature,
      it takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at
      10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p></li><li><p>You have a
      pool of balance dice, which begins empty. Whenever the cursed creature
      scores or suffers a critical hit, add a balance die to the pool. When you
      or another creature within 30 feet of you would roll a d20, you can spend
      a balance die to make the result of that roll 10 or 11 (your choice)
      instead of rolling. All other modifiers and die rolls attached to the roll
      (expertise, etc) are resolved normally. If the roll is at advantage or
      disadvantage, you may use two dice to influence both rolls, or you may
      spend one die to provide a single result and the second is rolled
      normally. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use
      it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3><strong>Wise
      Discernment </strong></h3><p>You are extraordinarily hard to fool. You
      gain proficiency with the Insight skill, a d6 expertise die, and two
      Insight skill specialties of your choice. You also gain an expertise die
      on saving throws against spells of the enchantment or illusion
      schools.</p>
