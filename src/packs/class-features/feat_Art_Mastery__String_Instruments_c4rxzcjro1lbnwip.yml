      <p>The melodies you pluck spread like gusts of wind. You gain a number of
      melody charges equal to your Charisma modifier, which you regain whenever
      you finish a long rest. When using this musical art as a spell focus, if
      you cast a spell that targets only one creature you can spend a melody
      charge to target an additional creature within the spell's range.</p>
