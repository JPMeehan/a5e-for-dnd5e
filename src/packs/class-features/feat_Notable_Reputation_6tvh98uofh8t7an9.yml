      <p>At 13th level your name has spread far and wide, gaining you the
      respect of even important figures you&rsquo;ve yet to meet. Choose one of
      the following.</p>

      <h2>Armed Assistance</h2>

      <p>Mercenary groups make a point of making your acquaintance, especially
      in larger towns. As part of their hospitality they feed you and your
      companions, and provide a safe place to sleep, as well as offer to trade
      information and word of any jobs your group may be interested in. When
      these meetings go particularly well they might offer more tangible help in
      the form of scouting the area around a monster&rsquo;s den or distracting
      a group of bandits to give you an edge.</p>

      <h2>Noble Curiosity</h2>

      <p>Your reputation and ferocity have sparked the fascination of the
      nobility. A liveried servant is likely to approach you when you enter the
      holdings of such a noble and invite you to take part in their
      employer&rsquo;s hospitality. This includes lavish feasting, introductions
      to the rich and powerful, and offers of assistance such as mounts, the
      repair of your armor and weapons, and miscellaneous items worth less than
      5 gold.</p>

      <h2>Token of Gratitude</h2>

      <p>Word of your deeds is not just advantageous to you: many merchants are
      eager to capitalize on having done business with someone of your
      reputation. Upon recognizing you, they offer up to 15% off of the listed
      price of a particular item in exchange for some sign of your presence such
      as a small token or autograph.</p>
