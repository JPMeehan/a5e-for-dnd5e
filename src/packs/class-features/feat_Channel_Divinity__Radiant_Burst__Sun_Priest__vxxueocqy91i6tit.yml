      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use an action to clutch your holy symbol
      and emit a bright blast. In addition to dispelling any magical darkness
      within 30 feet, enemy creatures within 30 feet make a Constitution saving
      throw or are blinded by the light for 1 minute. A blinded creature can
      repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
      on itself on a success.</p><p>Alternatively, you can choose to make the
      light more harmful. On a failed saving throw a creature takes radiant
      damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level, or half damage on a success.</p>
