      <p>At level 14 your charge can send foes flying! If you are raging, as an
      action you may make a special Scattering Charge attack. To do so, you must
      have moved at least 10 feet this turn. Make a single melee weapon attack
      against a creature within reach. If you hit, that creature and all hostile
      creatures in squares adjacent to it are pushed 10 feet away from you and
      take an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. </p>
