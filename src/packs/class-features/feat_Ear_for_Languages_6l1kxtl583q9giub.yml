      <p>At 2nd level you train your mind to pick up languages as needed. By
      spending a short or long rest in the presence of a speaker of any
      language, you can acquire a rudimentary understanding of that language,
      enough to have a basic conversation. Any abilities you have that rely on
      sharing a common language and require a saving throw can work, but the
      target has advantage on their save.</p><p>The cognitive effort to decode
      the unfamiliar tongue means that if you use this ability again, you lose
      access to any other language you learned through it.</p>
