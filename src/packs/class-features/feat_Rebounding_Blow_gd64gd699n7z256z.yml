      <p>Starting at 14th level, you master your armor to the extent that you
      can turn a foeâ€™s momentum back upon them. While you are wearing heavy
      armor and a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a weapon attack,
      you can use your reaction to turn the miss into a hit. You only take half
      damage from the attack, and your attacker takes an equal amount of
      damage.</p>
