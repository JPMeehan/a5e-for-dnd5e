      <p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your cunning to detect, discourage, and
      distract others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet makes an
      ability check, attack roll, or damage roll, you can use your reaction to
      expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and
      subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. When you roll the
      minimum or maximum result for your Bardic Inspiration die, the creature is
      rattled until the end of your next turn. </p><p>You can choose to use this
      feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the Narrator
      determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or
      before damage is dealt. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if
      it’s immune to being charmed.</p>
