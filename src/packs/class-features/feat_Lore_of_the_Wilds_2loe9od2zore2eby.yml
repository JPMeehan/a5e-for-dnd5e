      <p>At 3rd level when you select this archetype, you become closer to the
      natural world. You learn the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find
      Familiar}</em>&nbsp;spell, which does not count against your spells known.
      You also gain proficiency with the Nature skill, and with scythes.</p>
