      <p>At 5th level, the magic bridged to your body becomes even wilder,
      increasing the chances that your attacks will be even more powerful. Your
      melee and thrown weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or
      20. If your critical hit range was already increased for any of these
      attacks, it instead increases by another point, to a maximum of
      17&ndash;20.&nbsp;</p>
