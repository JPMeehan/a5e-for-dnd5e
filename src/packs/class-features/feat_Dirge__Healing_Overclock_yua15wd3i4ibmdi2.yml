      <p dir="ltr">You cause a creature casting a spell or using an ability or
      feature that heals to heal itself (or others) for twice the normal amount.
      Then, the next three spells (or abilities) that the creature uses to heal
      itself (or others) heal only the minimum amount possible.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Spells of a lower spell level than the boosted spell, or
      abilities and features gained at a lower level than the boosted ability or
      feature, only add half a point toward the three needed to recover from
      this dirge.</p>
