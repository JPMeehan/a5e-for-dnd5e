      <p>You know just what to say you inspire an allyâ€™s flagging stamina. You
      can spend a bonus action to let an ally within 30 feet who can understand
      you spend a Hit Die. If it does, it rolls that Hit Die (adding its
      Constitution bonus) plus 1d8 and heals hit points equal to the total.
      </p><p>The bonus dice increase to 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and
      4d8 at 17th level. After you use this ability, the same ally cannot
      benefit from it again until you complete a short rest .</p>
