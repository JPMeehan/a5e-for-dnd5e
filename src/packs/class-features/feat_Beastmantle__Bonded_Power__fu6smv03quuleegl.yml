      <p>Also at 1st level you gain a special ability tied to the experiments
      that were pressed upon you. Your bonded power must be of the same line as
      your flesh and bone selection.</p>

      <p><strong>Beastmantle</strong>: You gain a Bite attack as a natural
      weapon which deals 1d6+Str piercing damage. When you cast a spell with a
      range of touch you may use your bite attack as part of the spellcasting
      action to deliver the spell. In addition you grow a long tail with a
      stinger. As a bonus action on your turn you may use your tail as a natural
      finesse weapon to attack. On a hit you deal 1d4 piercing damage and poison
      damage equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>
