      <p>At 3rd level, as a bonus action you can shape a weapon out of pure
      elemental energy. Choose a type of damage that your Elemental Blast can
      do. The weapon takes the form of any simple or martial melee weapon you
      are proficient with and has the normal properties of a weapon of its type,
      but instead of dealing its normal damage, it deals the damage of the
      elemental blast you selected.</p>
