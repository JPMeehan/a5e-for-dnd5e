      <p>At 14th level, choose one of the following.</p><p><em><strong>Takes One
      to Know One.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws made
      against enchantment spells and illusion
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Well-Worn Deception.</strong></em> You can cast
      an enchantment or illusion spell using a spell slot that is one or more
      levels lower by spending 1 favor point. For example, you could cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.f0lq2ogke9k8f1v9]{Mislead} (a
      5th-level illusion spell) by using a 4th-level spell slot and 1 favor
      point or with a 3rd-level spell slot and 2 favor points. Once you have
      used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you
      cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
