      <p>Also at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to choose an ally within
      30 feet of you. If the target can hear or see you, it regains hit points
      equal to 1d8 + your marshal level. Once you use this feature, you must
      finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p>

      <p>You can simultaneously target 2 allies with this feature at 3rd level,
      and starting at 7th level you regain use of this feature after finishing a
      short or long rest.</p>
