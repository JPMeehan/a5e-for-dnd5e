      <p>You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. As an action, you can
      make an Intimidation check opposed by the Charisma check of a creature
      that can see you. On a success, the next attack roll or opposed ability
      check you make against that creature within the next 10 minutes is made
      with advantage. Once you&rsquo;ve failed an opposed Intimidation check,
      you can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
