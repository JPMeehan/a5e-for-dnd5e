      vision on the world. Choose one of the following options. You must be
      proficient in a skill in order to gain an expertise die from Overpowering
      Personality.</p><h3><strong>Psych Out</strong></h3><p>You gain an
      expertise die on Intimidation checks. As an action, you can make an
      Intimidation check opposed by the Charisma check of a creature that can
      see you. On a success, the next attack roll or opposed ability check you
      make against that creature within the next 10 minutes is made with
      advantage. Once you’ve failed an opposed Intimidation check, you can’t use
      this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
