      <p>Also at 2nd level you treat spells of the <em>nature&nbsp; </em>school
      as wizard spells and can copy them into your spellbook for the normal cost
      in time and money per level. Only other Hedge Mages can copy them from
      your spellbook, however. You also permanently have the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find
      Familiar} and
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.z5a26lxyh3esw2rl]{Speak with
      Animals} spells prepared, and they do not count against your maximum
      number of spells prepared. You may cast them as rituals normally. Finally,
      you learn
      the&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.5o1rvwzxmsh5ji9i]{Druidcraft}
      cantrip, which does not count against your maximum number of cantrips
      known.</p>
