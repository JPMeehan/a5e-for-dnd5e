      <p>You learn to strike now, kill later. You gain proficiency with the
      poisonerâ€™s kit. In addition, your weapon attacks do 1d4 of ongoing damage.
      A creature can suffer a maximum number of these ongoing damage dice equal
      to your proficiency bonus the damage lasts for one minute, but any
      additional use of this ability on the same target resets the duration. The
      ongoing damage cannot be ended with a mere action; however, any amount of
      magical healing or a DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine) check ends the ongoing
      damage.</p>
