      <p>Whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack you may choose
      to do a Bloody Flourish.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Bloody
      Flourish</em></strong>.&nbsp;You make sure your strike is as bloody and
      gruesome as possible, making an Intimidation check.&nbsp; Each hostile
      creature within 20 feet of you makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC
      equal to the result of your Intimidation check. On a failure, a creature
      becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
