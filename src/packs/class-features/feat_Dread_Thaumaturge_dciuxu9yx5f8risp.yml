      <p>At 20th level, you have learned all you can from your patron. You gain
      the following abilities.&nbsp;</p><h2>Aura of Anathema</h2><p>Hostile
      creatures within 120 feet gain vulnerability to necrotic damage. A
      creature with resistance to necrotic damage instead loses its resistance,
      and a creature immune to necrotic damage instead replaces that immunity
      with resistance.</p><p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose a
      different damage type for your aura.</p><h2>Highest Arcanum</h2><p>You
      learn an ultimate exploit in the laws of magic. Choose one of the
      following:</p><ul><li>Once between rests, you can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.l3lr6rwvw7csn6on]{Plane Shift}
      without material components.</li><li>You are under the constant effects of
      the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.kbdluu7o446n2opz]{Foresight}
      spell. This effect can&rsquo;t be detected or dispelled by any means short
      of a @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.pe52jryde7ljobzq]{Wish}
      spell.</li><li>You can spend 1 minute in arcane contemplation to regain
      all expended spell points. Once you have used this feature, you must
      finish a long rest before you can do so again.</li></ul>
