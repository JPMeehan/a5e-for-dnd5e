      <p>You make sure you’re always prepared. Once per short rest you can
      produce a non-magical item that you could have purchased or prepared at
      some point, small enough to fit in whatever storage you have available.
      This could range from a forged passport in your pocket to a glider stowed
      in the hold of a ship you’re traveling on. Pay the appropriate price for
      it. Limits of causality apply.</p>
