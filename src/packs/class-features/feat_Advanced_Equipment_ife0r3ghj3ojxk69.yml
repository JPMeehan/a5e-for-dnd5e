      <p>At 9th level, you continue to upgrade your gear. Choose one of the
      following options or one of the upgraded options from level 5:</p>

      <h2>Advanced Armor</h2>

      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Upgraded Armor</em></p>

      <p>You continue to upgrade your armor, which gains an option based on its
      type:</p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Light Armor: </strong>The armor&rsquo;s stealth system
      improves. As a bonus action, you can become invisible until the beginning
      of your next turn. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal
      to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once) you can&rsquo;t do so again
      until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Medium Armor: </strong>The armor now includes a helmet
      with a protective breathing mask. You have advantage on saves against
      inhaled poisons and toxins and may hold your breath for an additional
      minute before you begin suffocating.</p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Heavy Armor: </strong>The armor includes a set of
      strength enhancers. When calculating what you can push, drag, or lift,
      your size is considered one step larger. This stacks with the Orc
      heritage&rsquo;s Heavy Lifter feature and similar features.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Weapon</h2>

      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Upgraded Weapon</em></p>

      <p>If your weapon does not have the Upgraded option for its type, it gains
      that now. If it does have that option, it instead gains the following
      one:</p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Weapon: </strong>Your weapon gains the Vicious
      property.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Automaton</h2>

      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Upgraded Automaton</em></p>

      <p>You further upgrade your automaton. Its AC increases to 15, its hit
      points increase to 50, and you add one of the following options:</p>

      <p><strong>Antitoxin Module: </strong>The automaton gains three charges
      which stack with the ones from Autonomous Medic (if applicable). It can
      spend a charge to neutralize one poison with a DC of 15 or lower in a
      creature it can touch. It regains all spent charges when you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Targeting Module: </strong>On its turn as an action, the
      automaton can highlight a target within 30 feet, granting an expertise die
      to creatures targeting it with attacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Flight Module: </strong>The automaton gains a fly speed of 40
      feet.</p>
