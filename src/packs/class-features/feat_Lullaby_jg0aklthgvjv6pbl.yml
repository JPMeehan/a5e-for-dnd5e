      dir="ltr">At 3rd level, you can lull almost any creature into a peaceful
      slumber, given enough time. You learn the sleep spell, or another bard
      spell if you already know it. When you cast sleep, you may choose to begin
      concentrating on the spell. If one of the creatures initially within the
      spell&rsquo;s area of effect falls below the remaining hit point threshold
      while you are concentrating on the spell, they are immediately affected by
      the spell, and their hit points are deducted from the remaining total. If
      multiple creatures are reduced below the remaining threshold at once, the
      spell affects those with the fewest remaining hit points first, as
      usual.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Rounds spent concentrating on the spell count toward the
      amount of time creatures are affected by the spell. If you lose
      concentration on the spell before its full duration, creatures who have
      already been put to sleep by the spell remain asleep for the regular
      duration of the spell unless awoken.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Finally, while concentrating on the spell, creatures that
      would be awoken by means other than taking damage must succeed on a
      Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or remain asleep, and
      you may use a bonus action during your turn to roll an additional number
      of d10 equal to your proficiency bonus and add it to the total number of
      hit points affected.</p>
