      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can spend 1 exertion to hold a melee weapon
      and concentrate on the future as a bonus action. You gain a prophecy die,
      which starts as a d6 and only applies to the weapon you used as a focus.
      You can add your prophecy die to your attack rolls or damage rolls, which
      you choose at the beginning of your turn.</p><p>If you choose to add it to
      an attack roll and miss, the prophecy is still unfolding and the
      die&rsquo;s size increases by one step (to a maximum of d8). On a hit, or
      if you choose to add it to a damage roll, the die&rsquo;s size decreases
      by one step (to a minimum of d4) as you leverage the forces of
      fate.</p><p>Your prophecy die lasts for a number of rounds equal to your
      proficiency bonus.</p>
