      <p>Also at 7th level, you learn to communicate with your allies using
      coded language, allowing you to hide additional messages in normal
      conversation. During the light activity portion of a&nbsp;long rest, you
      can teach this code to any friendly creature with which you share a
      language. It takes twice as long to convey a message this way. Observers
      might be able to detect that you&rsquo;re speaking in code, but only
      creatures who&rsquo;ve been taught the explorer&rsquo;s code understand
      it.</p>
