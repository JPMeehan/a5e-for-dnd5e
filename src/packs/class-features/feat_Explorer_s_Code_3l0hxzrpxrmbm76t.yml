      <p class="Indent1">Also at 7th level, you learn to communicate with your
      allies using coded language, allowing you to hide additional messages in
      normal conversation. During the light activity portion of a&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">long rest</span>, you can teach this code to any
      friendly creature with which you share a language. It takes twice as long
      to convey a message this way. Observers might be able to detect that
      you&rsquo;re speaking in code, but only creatures who&rsquo;ve been taught
      the explorer&rsquo;s code understand it.</p>
