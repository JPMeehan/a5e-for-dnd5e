      <p>At 3rd level when you take this archetype, your own courage inspires
      those around you to greater feats of valor and battlefield prowess,
      clearing their minds and hardening their resolve. Choose one of the
      following options: </p><h3><strong>Stand Fast</strong></h3><p>Friendly
      creatures within range of your Commanding Presence make their saving
      throws against effects that would cause them to become confused,
      frightened or rattled with advantage. In addition, if a creature so
      affected makes such a saving throw and <em>both</em> dice would have been
      sufficient to make the save, their attacks deal an additional 1d6 points
      of psychic damage to the source of the effect for the next 10
      minutes.</p><h3><strong>Shake It Off</strong></h3><p>If a friendly
      creature within the range of your Commanding Presence feature deals damage
      to the source of an effect that has caused it to become confused,
      frightened, or rattled, it gains an additional free saving throw against
      the effect, ending it on a success. If the creature successfully saves, it
      also regains hit points equal to 1d4+your Charisma modifier.</p>
