      <h4><em>Requirement: 11th level</em></h4><p>When a creature would drop you
      to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed strike
      against any enemy within your reach. On a hit, you can spend 1 exertion to
      roll your martial arts die and gain that many temporary hit points. You
      canâ€™t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
