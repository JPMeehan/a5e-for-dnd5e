      <p>You have mastered the art of leaving your past behind. You gain
      proficiency with the forgery kit, and with a week to prepare and a DC 17
      forgery kit check, you can create an entirely new identity for yourself
      that will stand up to all but the most intense scrutiny. Those attempting
      to penetrate your deception have disadvantage on their checks.</p><p>While
      inhabiting your new identity, even those who know you by sight must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Intelligence or Charisma modifier (your choice) to recognize you. Even
      then, you have advantage on Deception checks to convince them they are
      mistaken.</p>
