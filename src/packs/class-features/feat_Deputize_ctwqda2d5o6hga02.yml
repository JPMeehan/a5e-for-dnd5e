      <p>When you use your Judicial Review, you and a number of creatures up to
      your proficiency bonus all gain its benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>The other
      creatures may ask different questions, but you know what answers they are
      seeking and must approve them. A creature asking an unapproved question
      may try again (subject only to your patience), or you may simply deny it
      access to the benefits of this ability. The ability takes effect for all
      selected creatures once these conflicts have been resolved.</p><p>In
      addition, you and the affected creatures all gain a bonus to AC and saving
      throws equal to half your proficiency bonus for the duration of the
      effect.</p>
