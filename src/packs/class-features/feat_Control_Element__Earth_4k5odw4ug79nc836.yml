      dir="ltr">In addition to creating damaging blasts of elemental energy,
      elementalists are able to command and control elemental material at a
      distance. As an action, an elementalist can create effects at a range of
      30 feet, manipulating ambient elemental material to create any of the
      following effects. You must possess the proper elemental affinity to
      control an element.</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Elemental material weighing up to 5 lbs
      per elementalist level can be moved up to 30 feet.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Elemental material up to a cubic foot can
      be reshaped (such as ice or stone), using your power in place of any
      required tool proficiencies. Shapes can be made in amorphous elements
      (like air, fire, or water), but the shapes only hold for as long as you
      spend an action.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Earth can be used to shift stone and
      earth. A 5-ft square of soil can be dug, deposited 5 feet away. A
      5-foot-square section of earth or stone can be made into difficult
      terrain, or a 5-foot-square section of earth or stone difficult terrain
      can be smoothed into normal terrain. Breaking rock can be attempted as an
      action using your spellcasting ability modifier with proficiency as if it
      were a Strength check, or you can deal damage to an inanimate earthen
      object as an action to deal your earth blast damage to it. Earth can be
      used to perform the Grapple, Knockdown, and Shove maneuvers against
      targets in contact with earth or stone, engulfing, shaking, or pushing
      them with the earth.</p>
