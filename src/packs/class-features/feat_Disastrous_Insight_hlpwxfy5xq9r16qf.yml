      <p>At 10th level, your knowledge of past civilizations and the things that
      ended them gives you insight into how to avoid their pitfalls and face
      their dangers. You may use a bonus action to make a history check against
      an aberration, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant,
      humanoid, or monstrosity with an intelligence of 8 or higher. &nbsp;The DC
      of this check is 5 + the CR or level of the creature. &nbsp;On a success,
      if you chose
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.okthtwyohmh0eoa5]{Mystic
      Apprentice} as your Defensive Study, you may add your Intelligence
      modifier to one damage roll with any cantrip against that target for the
      next minute. &nbsp;If you chose
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.v4pkjilh484jph6i]{Precision
      Strikes}, you instead automatically benefit from it against that creature
      for the next minute without needing to spend a bonus action. &nbsp;Once
      you use this ability, you may not do so again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p>
