      <p>Your faith has a stronger than normal focus on language as a component
      of its religious training. You learn two languages from the following
      list: Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and Primordial. In addition, you learn
      Ecclesial Speech, which is a secret language known only to other members
      of your faith or order with its own spoken, written, and signed forms.</p>
