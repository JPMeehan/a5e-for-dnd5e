      <p>Starting at 5th level, your driving skills allow you to swerve around
      obstacles and through tight spaces where vehicles couldn’t normally
      function. While driving a vehicle, whenever an action would allow you to
      change the vehicle’s facing up to 90 degrees, you may change it up to 180
      degrees instead.</p><p>In addition, whenever an attack hits a vehicle
      you’re driving or a collision occurs involving a vehicle you are driving,
      you can use your reaction to avoid the worst of it, reducing the damage
      your vehicle would take by the result of a vehicle check (air, land, or
      water as appropriate to the vehicle).</p>
