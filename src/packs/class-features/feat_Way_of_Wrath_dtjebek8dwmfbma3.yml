      <p>For every berserker there is the spark of rage, ready to be fanned to
      inferno. The ways they use it however and how it came to be there can
      differ wildly. Some call upon their bloodline for inner strength, while
      others force it to a point of furious focus; many attribute it to the
      spirits that surround them. Still more gain their fury from a far more
      mundane source, such as betrayal or ill-treatment.</p><p>At 3rd level, you
      choose an archetype that defines the source of your rage. Your choice
      grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
      level.</p><p>Dreadnaught</p><p>Rager</p><p>Tempest</p>
