      dir="ltr">You wrap yourself in swiftly flowing wind to protect yourself
      against incoming attacks. You gain a +5 bonus to your speed.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, when you are hit by an attack, you can use your
      reaction to add your spellcasting ability bonus to your AC, potentially
      causing the attack to miss you. You can also use this same reaction in
      response to failing a saving throw against an inhaled effect, such as
      stinking cloud or an inhalation poison, gaining a +1d4 expertise die to
      the save.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 10th level, you learn how to use your enveloping winds to
      redirect attacks. If a ranged weapon attack targeting you misses as a
      result of your enveloping winds reaction, you can choose another target
      within 60 feet of you and redirect the attack. You reroll the attack roll
      using your own Spell Attack modifier, using the damage of the original
      attack.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 18th level, your enveloping winds become powerful enough
      to deflect even magic. You can now use your enveloping winds reaction to
      attempt to deflect any ranged attack, not just a ranged weapon attack.</p>
