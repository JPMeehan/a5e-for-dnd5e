    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, your skin mutates and sheds, revealing armor-like patches
      of barnacles, chitinous plates, glowing crystals, scales, or the like.
      When you take damage, except for psychic damage, you can use your reaction
      to reduce the amount taken by your spellcasting ability modifier + your
      warlock level (minimum 1). Once you have used this feature a number of
      times equal to half your proficiency bonus, you canâ€™t do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
