  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to
      nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant attacks
      you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your herald spell save DC.
      On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the
      attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune
      to this effect for 24 hours. The beast or plant has advantage on this
      saving throw if it has a CR equal to or higher than your herald level. A
      creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.
      </p><p>In addition, you canâ€™t be charmed or frightened by elementals or
      fey.</p>
