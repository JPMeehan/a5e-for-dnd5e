      <p>Beginning at 18th level, your poise and charm allow you to impose your
      vision on the world. Choose one of the following options. You must be
      proficient in a skill in order to gain an expertise die from Overpowering
      Personality.</p><h2>Dress Rehearsal</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on
      Performance checks. You can spend 10 minutes practicing a skill of your
      choice, at the end of which you make a Performance check. You can use this
      result to replace the die roll of one ability check you make using that
      skill in the next hour. You may decide to use this feature after seeing
      the die roll. Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it
      again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Psych Out</h2><p>You
      gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. As an action, you can make
      an Intimidation check opposed by the Charisma check of a creature that can
      see you. On a success, the next attack roll or opposed ability check you
      make against that creature within the next 10 minutes is made with
      advantage. Once you&rsquo;ve failed an opposed Intimidation check, you
      can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long
      rest.</p><h2>Roguish Charm</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Persuasion
      checks. After you spend a minute in conversation with a creature that is
      not hostile, you may make a Persuasion check opposed by its Insight. On a
      success, the creature is nonmagically charmed by you for 1 hour. The charm
      ends early if you or your allies harm the creature. Once you&rsquo;ve used
      this feature successfully, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a
      long rest.</p><h2>Social Expertise</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on
      checks made with one of the following skills: Deception, Insight, or
      Sleight of Hand.</p>
