      <p>Until the charmed condition ends, you establish a telepathic link with
      it while you are on the same plane. You may issue commands through this
      link and the target does its best to obey. No action is required to issue
      commands, which can be a simple and general course of action such as
      "Attack that target, " "Go over there, " or "Bring me that object."
      Without commands the target only defends itself. The target continues to
      follow a command until its task is complete.</p>

      <p>You can use your action to assume direct control of the target. Until
      the end of your next turn, you decide all of the target's actions and it
      does nothing you do not allow it to. While a target is directly controlled
      in this way, you can also cause it to use a reaction, but this requires
      you to use your own reaction as well.</p>

      <p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new saving throw against
      the spell, ending the spell on a success.</p>
