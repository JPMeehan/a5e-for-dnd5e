      dir="ltr">Your Book Of Shadows serves as a masterwork book on a plethora
      of eldritch secrets. By spending 1 hour reading your Book of Shadows
      (which may be part of a short or long rest), you may select a number of
      specialties in Arcana, History, and/or Religion equal to half your
      spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1) and gain an expertise die on
      checks made regarding the chosen specialties. Each time you study the book
      in this manner, you may replace any or all of these selections with new
      ones.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, while you have access to your Book of Shadows
      you may perform the research downtime activity without needing access to a
      library.</p>
