      <p>At 14th level, you are exceptionally good at convincing your foes to
      attack someone other than yourself. When a creature you can see targets
      you with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to focus its
      attention on a creature you choose within its reach or within range of it.
      It makes a Charisma saving throw and on a failure, it instead targets the
      chosen creature with its attack or spell (gaining advantage if the chosen
      creature is an ally). </p><p>Once you have used this feature a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
