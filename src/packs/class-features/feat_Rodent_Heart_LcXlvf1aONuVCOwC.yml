      <p>You share a kinship with the small and furry, and share their nervous
      energy and penchant for small spaces. You can move through spaces one size
      smaller than your own without squeezing.</p>

      <p>In addition, your flight reflex is so high-tuned that you may move
      normally while surprised, but you can only take the dash action, and you
      still cannot take other actions or reactions when surprised as normal.</p>
