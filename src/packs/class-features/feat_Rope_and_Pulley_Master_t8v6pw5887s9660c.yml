    value: >-
      <p>Numerous logistic puzzles can be solved with just a rope, a pulley, and
      proper application of intellect. By spending 10 minutes working with at
      least 300 feet of rope, you can create the following through ingenious use
      of ropes and pulleys.</p>

      <p>A rope system that provides safe travel over a gap of 50 feet or less.
      You must be able to access both sides of this gap to create a rope system
      in this way.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>A rope system that allows a creature to lift an object of a weight up
      to 5 &times; its carrying capacity directly up as far as 50 feet.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>A rope system that allows a creature to drag an object of a weight up
      to 5 &times; its carrying capacity as far as 50 feet.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>A manual rope elevator that allows a single Medium-sized or smaller
      creature to travel up to 50 feet straight up and down as if it were
      difficult terrain (a tree,<br>cliff wall, ceiling, or similar structure is
      required at the top of this elevator for the ropes to attach).</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can also deconstruct and recover the rope used in any of these rope
      creations by spending 10 minutes tearing it down.</p>
