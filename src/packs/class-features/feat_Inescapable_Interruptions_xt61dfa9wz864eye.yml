      <p>Starting at 6th level, you know how to strike in order to disrupt
      concentration at the expense of your other adept techniques.</p><p>Once
      per turn, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell,
      you can spend an exertion point to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom
      (Insight) against their spell save DC. On a success, you gain the
      following effects when you take the Attack action against this
      creature:</p><ul><li>You gain an expertise dice for those attack
      rolls.</li><li>On a hit, the target&rsquo;s DC for the concentration
      checks uses your Combat Maneuver DC, or half the damage received,
      whichever is higher.</li><li>On a hit, the target has disadvantage on
      checks made to maintain concentration, but has advantage on checks made to
      resist effects from your Focus Features (such as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.6ke5eufijnme1uzi]{Stunning
      Strike}).</li></ul><p>These effects last either for one minute, until you
      choose to end it, or until you use this feature on a different target.</p>
