      <p>Starting at 6th level, you know how to strike in order to disrupt
      concentration at the expense of your other adept techniques.</p>

      <p>Once per turn, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts
      a spell, you can spend an exertion point to make a Wisdom (Perception) or
      Wisdom (Insight) against their spell save DC. On a success, you gain the
      following effects when you take the Attack action against this
      creature:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You gain an expertise dice for those attack rolls.</li>

      <li>On a hit, the target&rsquo;s DC for the concentration checks uses your
      Combat Maneuver DC, or half the damage received, whichever is higher.</li>

      <li>On a hit, the target has disadvantage on checks made to maintain
      concentration, but has advantage on checks made to resist effects from
      your Focus Features (such as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.5wrw48ctsb9sm48o]{Stunning
      Strike}).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>These effects last either for one minute, until you choose to end it,
      or until you use this feature on a different target.</p>
