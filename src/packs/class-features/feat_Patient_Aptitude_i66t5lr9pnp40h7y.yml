      <p>At 6th level, your command over your magic becomes more precise, and
      you are able to assert more control over it.</p><hr><p>You may pick a
      number of spells with the ritual tag equal to your Charisma modifier.
      These spells need not be from the sorcerer spell list, but they must be of
      a level for which you have spell slots. You can cast these spells as
      rituals, though you don&rsquo;t gain the ability to cast them normally
      with spell slots, nor do they count toward your spells known. If you
      increase your Charisma modifier, the number of ritual spells you know also
      increases. Each time you gain a sorcerer level, you may replace one of
      these ritual spells with another.</p>
