      <p>When an animal first encounters your might, you can cow them. When you
      grapple a creature with the beast creature type, you may spend a bonus
      action to whisper a threat into its ear. The creature understands the
      intent, if not the words, and must make a Wisdom saving throw against your
      maneuver DC. On a failure, the creature becomes docile and biddable for
      ten minutes, after which it reverts to its normal behavior. While the
      creature is affected in this way, it will not attack and will follow
      commands that do not counteract its nature. If it takes damage or is
      commanded to act against its nature (such as asking a cow to cross a
      cattle guard), it makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the
      effect ends.</p>
