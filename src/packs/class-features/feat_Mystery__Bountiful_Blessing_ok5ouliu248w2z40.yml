      <p>When using a Witch&rsquo;s Blessing to bless a target, the bonus
      increases to d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. If the Witch&rsquo;s
      Blessing causes a creature to succeed on the roll, they gain inspiration.
      A creature who gains inspiration in this way cannot do so again until they
      finish a long rest.</p>
