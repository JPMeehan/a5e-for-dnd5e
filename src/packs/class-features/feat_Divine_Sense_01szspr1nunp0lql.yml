      <p>Choose one of the following sets of enemies: celestials and fiends, fey
      and elementals, or aberrations and undead. You can always sense when a
      creature of one of your chosen types is within 30 feet of you, but cannot
      determine their number, type, or location. As a bonus action, you can
      briefly enhance your senses to learn the location, number, and type of any
      creatures of your chosen types within 30 feet of you. When you do so,
      creatures of those types that are within range make a Wisdom saving throw
      against your spell save DC, with advantage if the creature's CR is higher
      than your herald level. On a failed save, you also learn the creature's
      identity. Within the same radius, you also detect any locations that have
      been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</p><p>You can
      activate this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier,
      and regain spent uses upon finishing a long rest. Upon finishing a long
      rest, you may also swap your chosen set of creature types for another.</p>
