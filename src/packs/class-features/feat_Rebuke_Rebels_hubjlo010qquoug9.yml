      14th level, you are prepared to deal out punishment to those who resist
      your reign. When you cast a wielder spell that requires an initial
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you may choose to deal an
      amount of psychic damage equal to 1d6 times the level of the spell to
      creatures who succeed on their saving throw. You may do likewise to
      creatures who are targeted but not affected by wielder spells you cast
      that affect creatures with a certain number of hit points.</span></p>
