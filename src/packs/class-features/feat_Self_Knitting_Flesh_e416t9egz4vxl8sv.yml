    value: >-
      <p>Also at 6th level, you become extraordinarily resilient, gaining
      powerful healing abilities and allowing you to shrug off effects that
      would make harm done to you persistent. You are immune to effects that
      would prevent you from regaining hit points or that would lower your hit
      point maximum.</p>

      <p>While you are raging, you can use a bonus action to expend one of your
      hit dice, rolling it and recovering hit points equal to the roll&rsquo;s
      result + your Constitution modifier.</p>
