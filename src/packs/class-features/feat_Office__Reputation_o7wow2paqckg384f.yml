      <p>Your reputation for talented ministry and good works precedes you.
      Common folk frequently recognize you on sight, and those who do often have
      a friendly disposition towards you. They often ask you for counsel,
      favors, and blessings. The disposition of people they introduce you to are
      one stage better than normal (the indifferent become friendly, the hostile
      become indifferent).</p>
