      <p>At 14th level, you have learned to adapt your tools quickly in an
      emergency situation. As an action, you can quickly repurpose one of your
      spell inventions. When you do, select a spell of equal or lower level than
      the spell inventionâ€™s current spell from the artificer list. The next time
      the spell invention is used, it casts the selected spell, then
      automatically fizzles. When you repair the spell invention, you may choose
      whether it returns to casting whatever spell it was originally built to
      cast or continues to cast the new spell.</p><p>You can use this feature a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses of
      this feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
