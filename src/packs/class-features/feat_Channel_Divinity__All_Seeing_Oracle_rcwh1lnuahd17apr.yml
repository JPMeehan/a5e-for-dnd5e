      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you may use your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.s4iiatrup3e3virw]{Channel
      Divinity} to briefly look through the eyes of another. While doing so, you
      are blind to your own surroundings and see through the eyes of a creature
      you name. As long as the creature is alive and on the same plane of
      existence, you recall a still image of its surroundings exactly as it saw
      them in a single moment. If the creature is dead, blinded, unconscious, or
      protected from divination magic this feature has no effect.</p>
