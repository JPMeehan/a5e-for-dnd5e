    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you can turn a deck of cards into razor- sharp throwing
      projectiles. To do so, spend a use of Bardic Inspiration as a bonus action
      to transform a deck of cards you are wielding or carrying into weapons for
      one hour. Any individual card from the deck wielded by you (and you only)
      has the game statistics of a throwing dagger. Damage from the thrown cards
      is magical. While this effect persists, you may spend a bonus action to
      make a ranged attack with a card when you take the Attack action or cast a
      cantrip.</p>
