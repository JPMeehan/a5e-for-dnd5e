      <p>When you choose this invocation, choose one spell of the summoning
      school of your choice from any spell list, up to a spell level that you
      are capable of casting (maximum of 5th-level). You can cast this spell
      once by spending an appropriate number of spell points (see Table: Spell
      Points). You cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
