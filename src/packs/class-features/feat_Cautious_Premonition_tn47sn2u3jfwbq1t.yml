      <p>At 6th level, you can focus your connection to fate to determine the
      outcome of an action you are about to take. After you declare your action
      but before you resolve it, you can choose to have a premonition. Roll a
      d20. This roll will be used as the&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">first attack roll</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">ability check</span>&nbsp;you make during the
      action, if you perform the action. You can then decide whether to proceed
      with the planned action, accepting the rolled result, or take a different
      action, discarding the result.</p>

      <p>If you choose not to proceed with the action, you can either take a
      completely different action (casting a spell or making an ability check
      instead of making a weapon attack, for example) or do nothing, but you
      can&rsquo;t take another action of the same type (such as casting a
      different spell or attacking with a different weapon). Your premonition
      only reveals the result of a single d20 roll; if you roll with&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">advantage</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">disadvantage</span>&nbsp;, you learn the result
      of only one of the two dice. Similarly, if you have an ability that would
      allow you to reroll, you do not get to see the reroll.</p>

      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
      bonus, but never more than once per turn. You regain all uses when you
      finish a&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">long rest</span>.</p>
