      <p>You are not one to retreat. At 3rd level when you take this archetype,
      you can run right through damage. While you are raging, once you have
      moved at least 10 feet, until the beginning of your next turn, every time
      you take damage, it is reduced by an amount equal to your proficiency
      bonus. This reduction is only applied once per source no matter how many
      different types of damage it does. </p>
