      <p>When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
      channel your fury in a manner that trolls find both terrifying and
      familiar. You learn a maneuver from the&nbsp;Tooth and Claw&nbsp;tradition
      that you meet the prerequisites for, and it does not count against your
      maneuvers known. When you enter a rage, choose one of the following
      options:</p><h3 class="Indent3">Fiery Armaments</h3><p>Your melee weapon
      attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage. This damage increases to 2d6
      at 15th level.</p><h3 class="Indent1">Troll Claws</h3><p>You grow long,
      sharp claws like a troll, which allow your unarmed strikes to deal 1d6
      slashing damage and count as weapons with the finesse and dual-wielding
      properties. At 10th level, the damage of your claws increases to 1d8.
      While your claws are manifested, Tooth and Claw maneuvers have their
      exertion cost reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.</p><p>When you reach level
      11, you can manifest both effects simultaneously.</p>
