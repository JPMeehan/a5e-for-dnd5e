      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you and your allies can work together in combat
      beyond what each of you can individually achieve. You add the Sanguine
      Knot tradition to the list of martial traditions you can choose combat
      maneuvers from. In addition, choose one of the following options.
      </p><h3><strong>Helper</strong></h3><p>By creating a brief diversion or
      signalling an enemyâ€™s vulnerability, your allies can strike true. You can
      use a bonus action and choose an ally within 30 feet who can see or hear
      you, granting advantage on the next ability check or attack roll they make
      before the start of your next turn.</p><h3><strong>Hinderer
      </strong></h3><p>By distracting an enemy, you can reduce its ability to
      harm you and your allies. You can use a bonus action and choose a creature
      within 30 feet who can see or hear you, giving it disadvantage on the next
      ability check or attack roll it makes before the start of your next
      turn.</p>
