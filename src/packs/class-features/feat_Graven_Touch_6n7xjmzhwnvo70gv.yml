      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.my42mip0qc35rcp2]{Lay
      on Hands} ability no longer works as it did before. Your Lay on Hands
      ability can restore hit points to undead creatures (including yourself),
      but healing is now only half as efficient as it once was; you must spend 2
      points to heal a point of damage, and you must spend 7 to cure a disease
      or neutralize a poison. However, you can now spend 5 points to deal an
      additional 1d8 points of necrotic damage when hit with a weapon attack.
      This may not be combined with
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.c6aiq8cd90fo3ry1]{Divine
      Smite}, and you cannot spend more than 5 points per turn on this
      feature.</p>
