      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, your Lay on Hands ability no longer works as it
      did before. Your Lay on Hands ability can restore hit points to undead
      creatures (including yourself), but healing is now only half as efficient
      as it once was; you must spend 2 points to heal a point of damage, and you
      must spend 7 to cure a disease or neutralize a poison. However, you can
      now spend 5 points to deal an additional 1d8 points of necrotic damage
      when hit with a weapon attack. This may not be combined with Divine Smite,
      and you cannot spend more than 5 points per turn on this feature.</p>
