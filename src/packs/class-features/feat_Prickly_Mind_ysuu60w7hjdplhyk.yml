      <p>Starting at 15th level, your reactions are so honed that you react even
      to magic trying to affect your mind. When you make a saving throw to
      resist being charmed, you can use your reaction to deal an amount of
      psychic damage equal to your proficiency bonus to the creature attempting
      to charm you. This backlash does not reveal the creature that tried to
      charm you.</p><p>In addition, you gain proficiency with Wisdom saving
      throws.</p>
