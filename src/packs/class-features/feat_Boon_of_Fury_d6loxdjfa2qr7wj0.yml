      <p>Your weapon attacks deal extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. In
      addition, you can infuse divine power into a weapon attack to deal an
      extra 1d8 damage, the type of which is the same as you deal with Channel
      Divinity: Elemental Intervention. Once you have used this feature a number
      of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
