      <p>Starting at 13th level, you can try to secretly gather information
      about a person or object. You can only do so in a settlement in which you
      have spent at least a week. You must spend a day and 100 gold or more in
      order to make this attempt. You may only make one such attempt per person
      or object. </p><p>If you are researching a person, you learn at least one
      location where they were seen within the last month (if any) and one
      secret about the person, as well as any notable allies, enemies, and
      current gossip. </p><p>If you are researching an object, you learn its
      last owner and one place it was seen within the last month or its last
      known approximate location. If the object is magical, you learn any powers
      it possesses. Unless the Narrator decides otherwise, you donâ€™t learn
      curses and secrets.</p>
