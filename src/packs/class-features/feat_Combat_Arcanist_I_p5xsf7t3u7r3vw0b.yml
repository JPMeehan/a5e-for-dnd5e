      dir="ltr">At 3rd level, your acuity in spellcasting grows, though it tends
      to be slightly out of step with other spellcasters. You gain two
      additional spells that you can cast once per long rest. Once you have used
      one of these spells, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve used
      4 exertion points on maneuvers or for other purposes.</p><p dir="ltr">If
      you have the ability to cast spells through another class, these spells
      are considered to be known or always prepared and do not count against
      your class limit of spells known. You may use the spell slots to cast
      these spells normally.</p><p dir="ltr">Choose one of the following
      options:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><strong>Controller</strong>:
