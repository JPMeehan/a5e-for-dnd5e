      <p>When you are targeted by a ranged attack , you can use reaction to move
      your speed. Until the end of your next turn, ranged attacks against you
      have disadvantage . Additionally, your movement might get you to a
      location where cover makes you hard or impossible to hit. Reduce your
      speed on your next turn by the distance that you move when using this
      trick.</p>
