      dir="ltr">The most basic skill of any Spellslinger is the ability to
      utilize mystical ammunition. 1st level spellslingers gain the ability to
      cast cantrips through a ranged weapon that you are holding, which changes
      the attack into a ranged weapon attack rather than a spell attack. These
      attacks use the weapon&rsquo;s range increments as normal.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Cantrips cast in this way take the shape of mystic arrows,
      bolts, throwing weapons, or bullets, and any somatic components are
      replaced by the act of aiming and firing or throwing the weapon. So long
      as you possess at least one Javelin, Throwing Axe, Throwing Dagger, or
      other thrown weapon you may create such throwing weapons with Arcane
      Ammunition.</p>
