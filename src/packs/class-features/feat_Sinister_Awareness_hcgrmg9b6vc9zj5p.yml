      <p>At 11th level, you learn to extend your supernatural abilities into
      your senses. You may spend 4 exertion points to gain Truesight with a
      range of 30 feet for one minute. While this ability is active, you may
      attack creatures on the Ethereal Plane (such as ghosts or creatures under
      an <em>etheralness </em>effect).</p><p>While this ability is active, you
      can use this awareness to perceive the flow of life force through
      creatures and disrupt it with your strikes. Attacks you make with adept
      weapons or your unarmed strikes do additional necrotic damage equal to
      your martial arts die.&nbsp;</p>
