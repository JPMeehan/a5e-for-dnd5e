      <p>Also at 6th level, you can sing a song that heals mundane maladies. You
      can begin this song as an action, spending a use of your Bardic
      Inspiration feature. For the next hour, all non-magical diseases in
      creatures and vegetation within 30 feet of you are immediately cured. In
      addition, any withered (but not altogether dead) vegetation  becomes
      healthy again, and creatures in the aura recover 1 level of fatigue (a
      creature may only receive this benefit once per day). To keep this power
      active, you must sing continuously, which requires concentration (per a
      spell) and precludes you from casting spells.</p>
