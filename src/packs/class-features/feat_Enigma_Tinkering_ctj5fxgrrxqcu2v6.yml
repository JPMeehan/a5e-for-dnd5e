      <p>You&rsquo;re a long way from really understanding what you&rsquo;re
      doing, but with a little work you can temporarily access more magical
      abilities from your artifact. You may learn a new spell from the wielder
      spell list you don&rsquo;t currently know of a level you can cast by
      spending 1 exertion point or artifact charge and 1 minute&rsquo;s work
      tinkering. You lose any spells you learn in this way whenever you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>
