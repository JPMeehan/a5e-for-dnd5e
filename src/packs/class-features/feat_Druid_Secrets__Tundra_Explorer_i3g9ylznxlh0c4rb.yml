      <p>You embrace the cold of snowbound tundra. You are naturally
      acclimatized to cold weather and extremely low temperatures, you ignore
      the disadvantage to Perception checks imposed by blizzards, and you
      automatically succeed on concentration checks imposed by blizzards. In
      addition, you ignore the effects of roughing it imposed by resting without
      warmth in environments of extreme cold.</p>
