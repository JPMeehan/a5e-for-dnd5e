      <p dir="ltr">By spending 10 minutes focusing, you can use your element to
      communicate with another creature on the same plane as you. You must be
      able to name the creature, and both you and the creature must be within
      10-ft of an amount of elemental material that you have affinity for, such
      as fog, a bowl of water, a roaring fire, or a pile of rocks. An image of
      you and the creature you are speaking to appears within the elemental
      material. If a creature is unwilling to communicate, they can still see
      and hear you, but they do not appear to you unless they choose to respond.
      While you are focused in this way, you are unaware of your real
      surroundings and only perceive the person you are speaking to.</p>
