      <p>Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.01szspr1nunp0lql]{Divine
      Sense} can warn you of environmental hazards. Depending on which creature
      type pair you are attuned to, you can sense if you are within a mile of an
      area of a hazard or hazards associated with those types as indicated
      below. In order for this feature to work, &ldquo;hazard&rdquo; is defined
      by qualifying for the encounter element listed; this will not pick up a
      candle flame, a bottle of vinegar, someone&rsquo;s magnetized compass
      needle, an icebox, or other innocuous, typically non-hazardous occurrences
      of these conditions. You also know the general directions (compass points)
      of any hazards detected.</p>
