      dir="ltr">The bond between you and your elemental companion is so complete
      that philosophers debate where one soul ends and the other begins.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 15th level, you and your elemental companion gain the
      ability to speak with each other telepathically, as well as share each
      other&rsquo;s senses, as long as you are within 60 ft. You no longer need
      to see it in order to be able to give it commands or use it as the origin
      for your spells.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you
      can also affect your elemental companion if it is within 60 feet of
      you.</p>
