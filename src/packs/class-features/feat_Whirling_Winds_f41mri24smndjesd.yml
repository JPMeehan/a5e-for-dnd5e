      <p>Starting at 6th level, a gale whips up around you as you rage, kicking
      up grit and debris that &nbsp;make you difficult to see. These winds act
      as an aura extending 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through
      total cover. While you are raging, treat all attacks against you as though
      you had half cover (+2 to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks
      made to hide).</p><p>In addition, you gain resistance to either thunder or
      lightning damage, whichever you did not choose at 3rd level.</p>
