      <p>All sealers hold similar tenets, regardless of any master they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Stand Watch. </strong>Remain vigilant for powerful
      supernatural threats at all times.</li>

      <li><strong>Bar the Gate. </strong>If it is possible to prevent the
      arrival of a powerful, destructive entity, then that should be your
      goal.</li>

      <li><strong>Know the True Threat.</strong> Do not allow the malignant idea
      that anything unfamiliar is dangerous to infect your mind. Judge others on
      their actions, not their appearance or lineage.</li>

      <li><strong>Return the Fugitive.</strong> If something that should not
      roam free escapes its confinement, it is your responsibility to return it
      to its prison.</li>

      <li><strong>Seal Away. </strong>Guard the prisons of dangerous entities
      with dedication and care.</li>

      </ul>
