      <p>At 20th level, you become an extension of nature. Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape} has
      no duration. In addition, when you cast a druid spell you do not need seen
      or vocalized components, or any material components that have no cost or
      aren&rsquo;t consumed by the casting. You gain this benefit in both your
      normal shape and while using
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild
      Shape}.</p><p>You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of
      life around you and how to divert it as you see fit. You may cast the
      spells @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.d4gqwm4bxoklygp6]{True
      Resurrection} and<em>
      </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.77amz0lv01jzpzsg]{Power Word
      Kill}<strong>&nbsp;</strong>without expending a spell slot and without any
      material components. Once you cast either spell in this way, you cannot do
      so again until you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you can turn
      nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no matter your form.
      Once each turn, you can use a bonus action to choose a target point within
      30 feet and one of the following element options. If the element you
      choose is not present at or near the target point, any damage dealt by
      this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your spell attack, and
      creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to resist it.</p><h3
      class="Indent1">Air</h3><p>Each creature within 20 feet of that point must
      make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes bludgeoning
      damage equal to 3d8 + your Wisdom modifier and is flung up 20 feet away
      from the target point in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown
      target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 1d8
      bludgeoning damage. If the target is thrown at another creature, that
      creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save
      DC or it takes the same damage and is knocked prone. If the saving throw
      is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and
      isn&rsquo;t flung away or knocked prone.</p><p>In addition, all ranged
      attacks within 30 feet of the target point have disadvantage until the
      beginning of your next turn.</p><h3>Earth</h3><p>Clumps of dirt and stone
      explode outward. Creatures within 10 feet of the target point take 4d8
      bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A creature that makes a Strength
      saving throw against your spell save DC takes half damage is not knocked
      prone.</p><h3>Fire</h3><p>Flames roil outward in a burst of inferno.
      Creatures within 15 feet of the target point take 6d6 fire damage. A
      creature that makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC
      takes half damage.</p><h3>Ice</h3><p>You condense and flash freeze the
      water from a vast area above you into a massive boulder to drop down with
      immense force. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature at least 30
      feet below the target point. On a hit, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning
      damage and 4d6 cold damage.</p><p>In addition, the area in a 20-foot
      radius around the creature becomes difficult terrain for 1
      minute.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>You create a 20-foot tall, 20-foot wide wave
      that travels 30 feet in one direction and then crashes down. Any Large or
      smaller creatures and objects in the wave's path make a Strength saving
      throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8
      bludgeoning damage and is carried with the wave. Any creature that
      succeeds on its saving throw takes no damage and is not
      moved.</p><h3>Wood</h3><p>Splinters appear and fling themselves into flesh
      and armor alike. Creatures within 20 feet of the target point take 4d6
      piercing damage. A creature that makes a Dexterity saving throw against
      your spell save DC takes half damage.</p>
