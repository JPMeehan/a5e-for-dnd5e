      <p>At 20th level, you become an extension of nature. Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape} has
      no duration. In addition, when you cast a druid spell you do not need seen
      or vocalized components, or any material components that have no cost or
      aren&rsquo;t consumed by the casting. You gain this benefit in both your
      normal shape and while using
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape}.</p>

      <p>You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of life around
      you and how to divert it as you see fit. You may cast the spells
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.d4gqwm4bxoklygp6]{True
      Resurrection}&nbsp;and<em>
      </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.77amz0lv01jzpzsg]{Power Word
      Kill}<strong>&nbsp;</strong>without expending a spell slot and without any
      material components. Once you cast either spell in this way, you cannot do
      so again until you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Finally, you can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons
      no matter your form. See the other entries.</p>
