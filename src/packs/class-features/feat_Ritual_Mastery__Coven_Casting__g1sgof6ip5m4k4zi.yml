      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Witches have an
      unparalleled mastery of ritual magic. A 9th level, you can cast any witch
      spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In
      addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the
      following abilities.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You may link two
      other creatures while ritual casting. When the three of you work together
      tto ritually cast a spell that any of you are capable of ritually casting,
      you may upcast the spell to the highest level available to you. All three
      participants must be involved for the entire casting as if tthey were
      individually performing the ritual, and it takes the full casting time +
      10 minutes, unless all participants have an ability that reduces ritual
      casting time.</p>
