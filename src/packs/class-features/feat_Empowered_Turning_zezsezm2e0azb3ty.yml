      <p>At 5th level your greater entity grants you improved ways to turn
      undead or other abhorrent beings. You gain this feature again at 8th,
      11th, 14th, and 17th level. Each time you gain Empowered Turning, choose
      one of the following:</p><h2>Command Undead</h2><p>If you choose,
      creatures you turn instead regard you as their master for the duration.
      While they are under this effect, you may use your action to issue simple
      commands (no more than a sentence or two) which they are compelled to
      obey. They will not take any action that is obviously harmful to them, and
      so will not leap from a great height, jump onto a sword, or purposefully
      self-inflict any damage. They follow the command until you issue a new
      one.</p><h2>Destroy Undead</h2><p>Creatures turned by you of CR 1/2 or
      less are immediately destroyed, transformed into dust by a blinding flash
      of light. You can select this option multiple times. Each time you choose
      it, you are able to destroy more powerful creatures, progressing to CR 1,
      CR 2, CR 3, and then CR 4 each subsequent time you select this
      option.</p><h2>Turn Ideology</h2><p>Choose one of the following: Chaotic,
      Evil, Good, or Lawful. When you use Turn Undead, you can also choose to
      affect creatures with the chosen alignment trait. You can select this
      option multiple times.</p><h2>Turn Supernatural</h2><p>Choose a creature
      type from celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend. When you use Turn Undead,
      you can also choose to affect creatures of that type. You can select this
      option multiple times.</p>
