      <p>You gain proficiency in the Culture skill, or an expertise die if you
      are already proficient. If you spend 1 hour in a given community (such as
      a small town, noble&rsquo;s court, or criminal underworld) listening,
      talking and getting to know people, you learn the prevailing feelings and
      major happenings in the community, including any important recent or
      upcoming events, common gossip, important figures and rivalries, and
      general attitudes of the members. At the Narrator's discretion, you may
      receive more or less information depending on how the inhabitants of the
      settlement perceive you.</p>
