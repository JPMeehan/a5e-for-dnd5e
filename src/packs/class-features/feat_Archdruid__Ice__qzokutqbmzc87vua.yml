      <p>You can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no
      matter your form. Once each turn, you can use a bonus action to choose a
      target point within 30 feet and one of the following element options. If
      the element you choose is not present at or near the target point, any
      damage dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your
      spell attack, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to
      resist it.</p>

      <p><strong>Ice. </strong>You condense and flash freeze the water from a
      vast area above you into a massive boulder to drop down with immense
      force. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature at least 30 feet
      below the target point. On a hit, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning
      damage and 4d6 cold damage.</p>

      <p>In addition, the area in a 20-foot radius around the creature becomes
      difficult terrain for 1 minute.</p>
