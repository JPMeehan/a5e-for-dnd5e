      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can turn your inspiring talents to the
      multiplication of magic. When you see a spell cast on an ally within 30
      feet, you can use your reaction and expend a use of Bardic Inspiration  to
      twin it. If the spell is of 3rd-level or lower, targets only that ally,
      and you are also within the spellâ€™s range, you are also targeted by the
      spell. </p><p>When you reach 14th level in this class, you can expend two
      uses of Bardic Inspiration to twin a spell to target a different ally
      instead of you</p>
