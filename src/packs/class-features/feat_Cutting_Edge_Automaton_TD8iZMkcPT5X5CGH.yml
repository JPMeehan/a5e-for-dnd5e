      <p>Your automaton&rsquo;s speed increases by 20 feet, its AC increases to
      17, its hit points increase to 70, and you add one of the following
      options:</p>

      <p><strong>Stabilizer Ray:</strong> The automaton gains 3 charges which
      stack with the ones from Autonomous Medic and Antitoxin Module (if
      applicable). As an action on its turn, the automaton can spend a charge to
      automatically stabilize a creature making death saves within 30 feet of
      it. It regains all spent charges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Tinkerer&rsquo;s Arms:</strong> The automaton gains a set of
      built-in thieves&rsquo; tools and can use them with a bonus equal to your
      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier at your direction.</p>

      <p><strong>Teleportation Module:</strong> As a bonus action on your turn,
      you can teleport to an empty space adjacent to your automaton. Once you
      have used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence
      modifier (minimum once) you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
