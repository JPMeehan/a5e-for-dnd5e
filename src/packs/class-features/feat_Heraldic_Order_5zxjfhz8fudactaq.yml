      <p>Whenever you would pay for a meal, room, or minor supplies (such as
      mundane ammunition) roll [[/r 1d6]]. On a result of 4 or higher the
      merchant recognizes you as a herald of an order they either fear or
      respect and charge you nothing. If you insist on paying, they may offer
      you information about individuals or places that might be of interest to
      your heraldic order.</p>
