      <p>At 8th level, the energy and focus you bring to battle make your
      presence in combat a crucial factor for victory. The range of your battle
      hymns increases to 60 feet. </p><p>In addition, choose one of the
      following. </p><p>· You can expend 2 uses of Bardic Inspiration to
      activate two Battle Hymns at the same time. Losing concentration or
      changing battle hymns deactivates both. </p><p>· Pick three spells of
      4th-level or lower that have only vocalized components. These spells may
      be from any class spell list. You may spend 2 uses of Bardic Inspiration
      to cast one of the chosen spells at the start of your turn with no action
      required (instead of activating a battle hymn). </p><p>· When you expend a
      use of Bardic Inspiration to activate a battle hymn, you may also grant a
      Bardic Inspiration die to a creature within 60 feet. </p><p>Whenever you
      gain a bard level, you may change your Battle Hymn Specialization.</p>
