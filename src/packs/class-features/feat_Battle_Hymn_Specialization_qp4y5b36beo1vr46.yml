      <p>At 8th level, the range of your battle hymns&nbsp;increases to 60
      feet.</p>

      <p>In addition, choose one of the following.&nbsp;</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can expend two uses of Bardic&nbsp;Inspiration to activate two
      Battle&nbsp;Hymns at the same time. Losing&nbsp;concentration or changing
      battle&nbsp;hymns ends both hymns.</li>

      <li>Pick three spells of 4th-level or lower&nbsp;that have only
      vocalized&nbsp;components. These spells can be&nbsp;from any class spell
      list. You can&nbsp;spend two uses of Bardic Inspiration&nbsp;to cast one
      of the chosen spells at&nbsp;the start of your turn without using an
      action. If you do, you can&rsquo;t&nbsp;activate a battle hymn that
      turn.&nbsp;</li>

      <li>When you expend a use of Bardic&nbsp;Inspiration to activate a battle
      hymn,&nbsp;you can also grant a Bardic&nbsp;Inspiration die to a creature
      within 60&nbsp;feet.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Whenever you gain a bard level, you can change your Battle Hymn
      Specialization.</p>

      <p>At 12th level, you gain a second Battle Hymn Specialization.</p>
