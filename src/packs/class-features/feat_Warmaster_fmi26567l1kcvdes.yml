      <p>At 20th level, you have become an undisputed master of battle. You gain
      the following features.</p><h3 class="Indent1">Master of Combat</h3><p>You
      master every maneuver you know and any future maneuvers you learn as per
      Maneuver Specialization. Additionally, choose one maneuver of 3rd degree
      or less that you know. You are able to use the chosen maneuver without
      expending any exertion points.</p><h3 class="Indent1">Finishing
      Blow</h3><p>You can make spectacular, devastating attacks which inspire
      awe in those nearby. When you miss with a weapon attack while taking the
      Attack action, you can choose to hit instead. Alternatively, you can
      choose to change a hit with a weapon attack into a critical hit, or when
      you score a critical hit you can choose to deal maximum damage.</p><p>All
      hostile creatures who see your Finishing Blow make a Wisdom&nbsp;saving
      throw&nbsp;against your maneuver DC or become&nbsp;frightened&nbsp;for 1
      minute.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again
      until you finish a&nbsp;short or long rest .</p>
