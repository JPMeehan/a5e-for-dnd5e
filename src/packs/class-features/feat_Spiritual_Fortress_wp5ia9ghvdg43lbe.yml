      <p>At 15th level you gain an expertise die on all Intelligence, Wisdom,
      and Charisma saving throws. When you succeed on such a saving throw, you
      may use your reaction to deal damage equal to your divine smite to the
      creature that forced you to make the saving throw. Once you have done so
      you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
