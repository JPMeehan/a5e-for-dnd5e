      <p>Starting at 14th level, while you are&nbsp;bloodied</span>, you can use
      a bonus action to cause your viscous blood to coalesce into
      a&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.h8p1eywvlv5zocrp]{Black
      Pudding}&nbsp;that appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.
      This ooze takes its turn immediately after yours and obeys your verbal
      commands. Without such commands, the ooze only defends itself. It
      disappears after 1 hour, when reduced to 0 hit points, or if it
      can&rsquo;t sense another creature at the end of its turn. Once you use
      this ability, you must finish a&nbsp;<span>long rest before you can do so
      again.</p>
