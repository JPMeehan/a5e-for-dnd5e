      <p>When you take this archetype at level 1, your studies and interaction
      with forbidden lore and fallen divinity grants you power of your own. You
      gain proficiency in Arcana with a skill specialization in Forbidden Lore
      and gain one of the following:</p>

      <h2>Vestigialist&rsquo;s Curse</h2>

      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>

      <p>The curse has the following effects:</p>

      <p>Choose radiant damage or necrotic damage. When you deal damage against
      the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type.
      This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th
      level.</p>

      <p>You gain a pool of vestige dice, which begins empty. Each vestige die
      represents a flashes of supernatural knowledge granted by your patron.
      When the cursed creature ends its turn under the effects of one or more of
      the Charmed, Confused, Frightened, or Rattled conditions, add one vestige
      die to this pool. You can spend a vestige die when making an Arcana,
      History, or Religion check to gain a 1d4 bonus, or when making a death
      save or concentration check to gain a 1d4 bonus. The pool disappears when
      you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h2>Lost Knowledge</h2>

      <p>You gain proficiency with the Religion skill and gain the skill
      specialty of your choice of cults or prophecy. You also gain proficiency
      with the History skill and gain the skill specialty of either legends or
      genealogy. You also learn the following spells at the following levels,
      and they do not count against your spells known:</p>
