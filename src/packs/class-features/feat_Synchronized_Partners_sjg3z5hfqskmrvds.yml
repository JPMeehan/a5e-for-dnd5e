      <p>Starting at 14th level, you and your bonded artifact are in sync and
      can fully trust each other in the heat of combat. While your bonded
      artifact is animated, both you and your artifact have advantage on attack
      rolls so long as you both are within 5 feet of the target creature and
      neither of you is incapacitated.</p>
