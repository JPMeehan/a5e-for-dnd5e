      <p dir="ltr">Also at 2nd level, you have learned that your wild shape can
      be far more dangerous if you shift into that which is infected or dead.
      Whenever you Wild Shape into a creature, you gain the zombie template.
      Furthermore, while in your Wild Shape form, your natural attacks deal an
      additional amount of necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Lastly, if you use your Wild Shape feature to cast Find
      Familiar, you may instead choose the familiar to be undead, rather than
      fey.</p>
