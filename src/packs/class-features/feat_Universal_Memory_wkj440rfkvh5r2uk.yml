      mortals on the plane you occupy. As an action, you may do one of the
      following:</p><ul><li><p>Gain proficiency with a skill of your
      choice.</p></li><li><p>Learn a new spell you qualify to
      learn.</p></li><li><p>Gain proficiency with two weapons of your
      choice.</p></li><li><p>Gain proficiency with a saving throw of your choice
      that you are not already proficient in.</p></li><li><p>Gain proficiency
      with up a musical instrument or tool set of your
      choice.</p></li></ul><p>The new knowledge persists until you use this
      ability again or until you begin a long rest. Once you have used this
      ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once),
      you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
