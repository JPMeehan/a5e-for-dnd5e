      <p>At 3rd level you gain the following channel divinity
      options:</p><h2>Turn the Outsider</h2><p>As an action, you present your
      holy symbol and speak a divine word, rebuking the outsiders. Each fiend,
      celestial, aberration, or elemental creature or any creature with an
      alignment trait within 30 feet that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom
      saving throw. If the creature fails it is turned for 1 minute or until it
      takes damage from any source.</p><p>A turned creature must use its turns
      trying to move as far away from you as possible. It cannot willingly move
      to a space within 30 feet of you. It also cannot take reactions. On its
      action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape any effect that
      prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature
      can use the Dodge action.</p><p>At your Narrator's discretion, depending
      on the cosmology of your setting you may also turn other creature types
      such as fey or undead.</p><h2>Abjure the Mind</h2><p>As a bonus action you
      end any charm, fear, or possession effects on yourself or any allies
      within 10 feet. Starting at level 18, this area increases to 30 feet.</p>
