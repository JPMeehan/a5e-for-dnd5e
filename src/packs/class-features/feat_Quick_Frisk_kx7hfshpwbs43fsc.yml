      <p>You gain an expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks. You can touch a
      target to learn what they are carrying. Make a Sleight of Hand check
      opposed by the target&rsquo;s Perception. On a success, you learn what
      types of objects they are carrying. If they are carrying coins, you know
      the approximate number. For the next 24 hours, any Sleight of Hand checks
      you make against the target have advantage. On a failure, you can&rsquo;t
      use Quick Frisk against that target for 24 hours.</p>
