      <p>Also at 2nd level, you can recover some magical energy by tapping into
      leylines. While in natural surroundings, during a short rest you may
      recover spell slots of a total level less than or equal to half your druid
      level (rounded down), none of which may be higher than 5th level. Once you
      have used this ability, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
