      <p>Bogs and swamps are unpleasant to most but are filled with natural
      beauty to you. Moving through swamps, bogs, or muddy difficult terrain
      costs you no extra movement and you cannot become naturally lost while
      traveling through marshlands. In addition, you ignore the effects of
      roughing it imposed by resting in wet or swampy environments.&nbsp;</p>
