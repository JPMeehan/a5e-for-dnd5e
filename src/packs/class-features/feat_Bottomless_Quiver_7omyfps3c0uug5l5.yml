      <p>Also at level 7, you can spontaneously generate a single round of
      mundane ammunition for any ranged weapon you wield by spending your
      reaction. The ammunition appears loaded into the weapon. There is no limit
      to the number of times you can use this ability, but the ammunition cannot
      be used in conjunction with any spell requiring a ranged weapon attack,
      your Arcane Ammunition, Expanded Arcane Ammunition, or Supreme Arcane
      Ammunition features, or with other similar effects. The ammunition lasts
      for one round and then disappears, whether fired or not.</p>
