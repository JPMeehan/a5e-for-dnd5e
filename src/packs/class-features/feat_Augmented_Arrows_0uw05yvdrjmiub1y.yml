      <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to craft ammunition for the job at
      hand. At the end of each short rest, you can craft a number of augmented
      arrows equal to twice your proficiency bonus, each costing 1 sp of
      materials and an equal amount of ammunition. When you craft each augmented
      arrow, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. On a successful
      hit, the ammunition deals the usual amount of damage, but of the chosen
      type.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can use a bonus action to affix an item of Tiny size
      that weighs 3 pounds or less and can be used as an improvised weapon (such
      as an acid vial, alchemist&rsquo;s fire, or unstable arcanum) to the end
      of a piece of ammunition. This increases the item&rsquo;s range to that of
      your weapon&rsquo;s normal range and allows you to roll as though it were
      a ranged attack with which you are proficient, though it only deals the
      damage and effects of the item, not the ammunition utilized.</p>
