      <p>At 3rd level you gain proficiency with the Medicine skill. If you are
      already proficient with it, you instead gain proficiency with another
      skill from the scholar list. In addition, you gain an expertise die on all
      Medicine checks. At level 7 this increases to a d6, at level 10 it
      increases to a d8 and your maximum size for expertise die on Medicine
      increases to d10, and at level 14 increases to a d10 and your maximum size
      for expertise die on Medicine increases to d12. You may always choose to
      use Intelligence on Medicine checks.</p>

      <p>You also add @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-feats.3v3eg8ki8mwvkoc6]{Surgical
      Combatant} to the list of bonus feats you may choose.</p>
