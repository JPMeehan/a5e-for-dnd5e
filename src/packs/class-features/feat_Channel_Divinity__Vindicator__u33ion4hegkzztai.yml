      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
      Channel Divinity options.</p>

      <h3><strong>Hear Evidence</strong></h3>

      <p>As an action, you can sharpen your ability to sift worthwhile
      information from worthless. For the next hour, when you are asking
      questions about an injustice or its perpetrators, you gain advantage and
      an expertise die on all checks to distinguish truth from falsehood and to
      separate useful information from pointless details and red herrings.</p>

      <h3><strong>Render Verdict</strong></h3>

      <p>When you witness a grave injustice or atrocity yourself, you can
      condemn the perpetrator as a bonus action. To do so, you must be within
      100 feet of the creature you deem most responsible for the wicked deed.
      Alternatively, you may choose a single creature you have a warrant for.
      Used this way, the creature saves with advantage, but the range is
      unlimited. A creature so condemned must make a Charisma saving throw
      against your spell save DC. A creature that fails its save can no longer
      hide from you. For the next week, its outline seems to glow even behind
      solid barriers or if it becomes invisible or enters the ethereal plane. If
      the creature is far enough from you that you could not see it, a glow on
      the horizon indicates its general direction to you. These effects are only
      visible to you, not your companions. In addition, the damage dice of your
      Divine Smite ability become D10s against the creature and you have
      advantage on saving throws imposed by any of its spells or effects. This
      effect ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or you use this
      Channel Divinity option again.</p>

      <p>A creature that succeeds on its save instead has disadvantage on all
      checks to hide from you or put you off its trail for 24 hours.</p>
