      <p>At 18th level, your mastered maneuvers have become as natural as
      breathing, and you have the opportunity to pass your techniques down to
      the next generation. By spending 8 hours sparring, you can teach another
      willing creature a maneuver you have mastered using Maneuver
      Specialization. A creature must be proficient in at least one combat
      tradition to learn a maneuver in this way, it can only learn maneuvers of
      a degree from which it already knows at least one maneuver, this counts
      against its numbers of maneuvers known.</p>
