      <p>Your magic resonates through the air. When using this musical art as a
      spell focus, after casting a bard spell that used an ally as its point of
      origin on your last turn, if you cast the same spell normally its spell
      level increases by 2. Once you have used this feature a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, you can't do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
