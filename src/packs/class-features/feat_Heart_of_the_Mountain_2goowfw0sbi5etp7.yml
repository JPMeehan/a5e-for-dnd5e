      <p>At 18th level, you perfect your connection to earth and stone. When you
      cast a spell from the earth school (or that has &ldquo;earth&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;stone&rdquo; in its name) that has a casting time of 1 action, you
      can cast it as a bonus action instead.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you gain tremorsense to a range of 60 feet. If you are
      touching unworked stone, you can use an action to expand your
      consciousness through it, increasing your tremorsense to a range of 500
      feet until the start of your next turn. This provides you with insight
      into the layout of nearby caves and any creatures on the ground in that
      area.</p>

      <p>Finally, you can use an action to magically&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">petrify</span>&nbsp;yourself. While petrified in
      this way, you are aware of your surroundings and immune to all damage. You
      do not age, nor do you need to eat, sleep, or drink. While petrified in
      this way, you aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">incapacitated</span>, but you can&rsquo;t take
      actions or reactions except to end this petrification as an action. You
      can&rsquo;t be petrified by any other effect, unless you choose to be.</p>
