      <p>At 1st level, you learn that light is everything on the battlefield.
      You can use an action to touch a hostile creature within your reach,
      gently illuminating it with your divine will and granting advantage on
      attacks made against it before the start of your next
      turn.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use an action to touch an ally within
      reach, surrounding them with a coruscating shimmer of bright light. Until
      the start of your next turn, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls
      against the touched ally.</p><p>Once you have used this feature a number
      of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
