      <p>At 15th level when you use any combat maneuver that requires you to be
      mounted you only expend half the exertion (rounded up).</p><p>In addition,
      you gain the Ride Enemy combat maneuver. It does not count against your
      number of maneuvers known, and you do not have to spend exertion points to
      activate it.</p>
