      <p dir="ltr">Also at 3rd level, you receive training in heavier armor than
      most rangers. You become proficient with heavy armor and no longer suffer
      a penalty to Stealth checks for wearing medium armor.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, when you finish a long rest while wearing armor
      without the comfortable property, you may make a Constitution saving throw
      with a DC of 10 + the number of long rests you have attempted while
      sleeping in armor. If you succeed, you gain the full benefits of a long
      rest rather than reduced benefits for roughing it.</p>
