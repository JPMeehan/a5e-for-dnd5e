      <p>When you hit a Large-sized or smaller creature with your Eldritch Blast
      or when a Large-sized or smaller creature fails its saving throw against
      it, you can attempt to grapple the creature, using your spell save DC
      instead of your maneuver DC. The grapple automatically ends if the
      creature leaves your Eldritch Blast range or if you attempt to grapple
      another creature.</p>
