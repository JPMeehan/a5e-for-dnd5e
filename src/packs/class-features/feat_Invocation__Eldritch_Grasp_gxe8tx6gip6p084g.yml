      <p><em>Prerequisite: 7th level</em></p><p>When you hit a Large-sized or
      smaller creature with your Eldritch Blast or when a Large-sized or smaller
      creature fails its saving throw against it, you can attempt to grapple the
      creature, using your spell save DC instead of your maneuver DC. The
      grapple automatically ends if the creature leaves your Eldritch Blast
      range or if you attempt to grapple another creature.</p>
