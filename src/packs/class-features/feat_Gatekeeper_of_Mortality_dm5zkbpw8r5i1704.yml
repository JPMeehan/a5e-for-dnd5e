    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you gain the fearsome power and responsibility to
      shepherd souls into the afterlife. Your weapons and damaging spells deal
      an additional 2d6 points of radiant damage to undead creatures, and you
      automatically sense if a creature you can see is undead. At the Narratorâ€™s
      option, this bonus damage can also apply to creatures that have cheated
      death in some other way. You may also choose to deal radiant damage with
      your Eldritch Blast instead of the usual force damage.</p><p>You can also
      help the unquiet dead who wish to depart. You have advantage on all checks
      to discern how to lay such a creature to rest and to perform tasks
      necessary to do so. In addition, if a creature is unable to move on due to
      something that is now impossible to fulfil, you may cut the red tape of
      fate and send it to its eternal reward as an action. Once you have used
      this final option, you cannot do so again for a year.</p>
