      <p>At 3rd level, your senses sharpen to allow you to perceive your
      lightless environment. If you have the ability to see, you gain darkvision
      to a range of 120 feet and the ability to see through magical darkness. If
      you have blindsight, the range of your blindsight increases by 30
      feet.</p>
