      <p>Your armor&rsquo;s AC increases by 1, and you gain an additional
      feature based on its type:</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting-Edge Light Armor: </strong>You gain a Climb speed equal
      to your walking speed and you are permanently under a spider climb effect
      while you are wearing it.</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting-Edge Medium Armor: </strong>Your armor now includes
      various measures to prevent you from succumbing to the worst that
      supernatural foes can dish out. You gain immunity to the petrified
      condition and make saving throws to avoid the confused, frightened,
      incapacitated, paralyzed, and slowed conditions with advantage.</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting-Edge Heavy Armor: </strong>Your armor now protects your
      allies as well as you and has anti- magic countermeasures incorporated.
      Friendly creatures your size or smaller can use you to provide 3/4th
      cover. Your armor is also immune to magical spells and effects that target
      it specifically such as the heat metal spell or a rust monster&rsquo;s
      antennae.</p>
