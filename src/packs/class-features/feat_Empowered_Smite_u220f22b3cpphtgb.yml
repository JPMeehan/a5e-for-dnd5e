      The effect lasts for up to 1 minute, or until you target another creature
      with a weapon attack. As long as the effect lasts, the target gains no
      benefit from invisibility and has disadvantage on checks made to hide.</p>

      <p>At 4th level, you are able to manipulate magic to add extra power to
      your smites. Whenever you would use your Divine Smite feature, you can
      choose one of the following effects. Once you have used this feature you
      can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Alternatively, you can
      empower a smite by expending a spell slot of 1st-level or higher.</p>

      <p>Some empowerments require your target to make a saving throw to resist
      some of the empowerments effects. The DC for these saving throws is the
      same as your herald spell save DC.</p>

      <h2>Igniting Smite</h2>

      <p>Your smite instead deals fire damage, and the target must make a
      Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take 1d6
      fire damage. On a successful save, it takes no damage and the fire is
      extinguished. The fire can also be put out as an action or by the
      environment, and extinguishes itself after 1 minute.</p>

      <h2>Marking Smite</h2>

      <p>Your smite causes the target to shed bright light for 5 feet, and dim
      light for an additional 5 feet. The effect lasts for up to 1 minute, or
      until you target another creature with a weapon attack. As long as the
      effect lasts, the target gains no benefit from invisibility and has
      disadvantage on checks made to hide.</p>

      <h2>Repelling Smite</h2>

      <p>Your smite instead deals force damage, and the target must make a
      Strength saving throw or be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone. On a
      successful save, the target is knocked back only 5 feet and is not knocked
      prone.</p>
