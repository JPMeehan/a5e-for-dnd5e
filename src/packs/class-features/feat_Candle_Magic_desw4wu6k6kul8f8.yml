      <p>You may spend an amount of time equal to 1 hour + the casting time of
      any ritual spell you know to create a candle imbued with its power.
      Whenever any creature lights this candle, they gain benefits as if they
      had ritually cast the spell.</p>

      <p>A candle will burn for the duration of the spell contained within, and
      while burning cannot be put out by non-magical means. The creature that
      lit the candle can choose to extinguish it to end the spell early. Doing
      so saves any unused duration to be used later, though the duration must be
      spent in 1 minute increments.</p>

      <p>A witch may maintain a number of candles created in this fashion equal
      to their proficiency bonus, and if they attempt to craft another one while
      at this limit, the oldest one they made loses its magic. They must also
      have access to the materials necessary for candle making to do so, though
      the cost involved in doing so is negligible.</p>
