      <p>At 2nd level you learn to not merely adopt a creatureâ€™s form, but to
      empower it with your own will. When you would gain temporary hit points
      from assuming a wild shape, you gain twice as many temporary hit points
      instead. </p><p>In addition, you may add your Wisdom modifier to your AC
      while in a wild shape.</p>
