      <p>At 7th level, you’ve improved your techniques and methods for landing a
      crowd-pleasing blow. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of
      19–20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your
      critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17–20).</p>
