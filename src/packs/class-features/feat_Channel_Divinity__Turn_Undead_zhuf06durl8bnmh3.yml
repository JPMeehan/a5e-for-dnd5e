      speak a divine word, rebuking the undead. Each undead creature within 30
      feet that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the
      creature fails it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage from any
      source.</h4><h4>A turned creature must use its turns trying to move as far
