      <p>With a little reengineering technology can alleviate all manner of
      discomforts. Whenever you begin a long rest that would incur the penalties
      of roughing it (such as resting without heat in a cold environment, on
      unlevel rocky terrain, or without protection from pests in swampy
      environments) you may repurpose one of your currently prepared spell
      inventions. If you do, you do not suffer the penalties of roughing it
      during that long rest. You can determine the exact nature of this
      repurposed spell invention (some examples include using a burning hands
      spell invention as a space heater or a shocking grasp spell invention as a
      bug zapper).</p>
