      dir="ltr">At 14th level, your devotion and fury can protect your allies
      from death itself. When you touch a living creature at 0 hit points, you
      may use your action to stabilize it.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, when you touch a creature who has died within
      the last minute, you may use your action and expend one use of rage to
      return them to life at 1 hit point. You cannot restore missing body parts
      in this way, nor can you return a creature to life if they have died of
      old age.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Once you return a creature to life in this way, you must
      finish a short or long rest to do so again.</p>
