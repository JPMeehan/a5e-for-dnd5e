      <p>The changes the experiments have made do not begin and end at
      spellcasting, unfortunately. At level 1 your flesh and bone become
      tougher, and occasionally scaled, providing a bonus to your armor class
      when you are unarmored. Choose from the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Stone Eye</strong>: Your AC when not wearing armor is 12 +
      Dex</li>

      <li><strong>Beastmantle</strong>: Your AC when not wearing armor is 14 +
      Dex (Maximum 2)</li>

      <li><strong>Shapeshifter</strong>: Your AC when not wearing armor is 12 +
      Cha</li>

      </ul>
