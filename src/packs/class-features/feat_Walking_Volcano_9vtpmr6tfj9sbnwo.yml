      <p>At level 14, your volcanic transformation reaches its apex. While you
      are raging, you can spend an action to fill an area extending 10 feet from
      you with a cloud of dense smoke. You treat an area affected by your own
      smoke as lightly obscured rather than heavily obscured. Any given area of
      smoke persists for an 10 minutes or until dispersed by a strong breeze</p>

      <p>You can also generate and throw a volcanic bomb at a target within as
      an action. A volcanic bomb counts as a ranged weapon attack with a range
      of 30/60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 bludgeoning
      damage.</p>
