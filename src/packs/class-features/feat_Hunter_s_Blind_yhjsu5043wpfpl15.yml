      <p>You can spend 10 minutes constructing a natural shelter able to
      accommodate yourself and up to 9 other creatures of Medium size or
      smaller. The shelter blends in with its surroundings, and as long as no
      one moves into or out of it, the shelter is indistinguishable from a
      natural object. It is designed to allow creatures inside to see out but
      prevent anyone outside from seeing in.&nbsp;</p><p>The shelter is
      comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside, and counts as a
      haven.</p>
