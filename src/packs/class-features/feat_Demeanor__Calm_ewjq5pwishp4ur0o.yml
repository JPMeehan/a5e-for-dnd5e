      <p>Knowing how and when to embrace quietude allows your silence to speak
      far louder than any words, and you easily pick up on the subtleties
      revealed by body language and demeanor. When you first meet an NPC, you
      can choose to remain silent and speak through nonvisual cues â€” scrunching
      your brows, pursing your&nbsp;lips, narrowing your eyes, slowly leaning
      ever so slightly forward, hunching your shoulders, and so on. As long as
      you remain silent for 1 minute, the NPC has a CR lower than your level,
      and it remains within sight of you for the duration, it acts as if you
      succeeded on an Intimidation check.</p><p>In addition, you gain an
      expertise die on Insight checks.</p>
