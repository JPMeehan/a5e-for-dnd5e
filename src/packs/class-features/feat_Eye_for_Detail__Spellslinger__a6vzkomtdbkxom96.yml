      dir="ltr">Also at 7th level, your accuracy and arcana have long relied on
      powerful eyesight, and your training has paid off. You may detect magic as
      the spell. To use this ability, you must make an Arcana check. At a DC of
      10 you are aware of magical auras in your area. Should you choose to focus
      on a specific aura on a following turn, make an Arcana check DC 10 plus
      the spell level of the magical effect as an action to identify the school
      of magic it belongs to. This ability does not provide a passive or
      constant awareness of magical effects.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, you no
      longer take disadvantage on perception checks due to distance.</p>
