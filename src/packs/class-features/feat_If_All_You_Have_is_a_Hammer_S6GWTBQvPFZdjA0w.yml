      <p>You may spend 1 exertion to make a weapon attack roll with an
      appropriate weapon in place of a tool check, or in place of a Sleight of
      Hand, Engineering, or Athletics check where you could apply a weapon. This
      could mean picking a lock with a dagger, prying a door open with a sword,
      swiping a pouch with a rapier, or shoring up a tunnel with a spear.</p>
