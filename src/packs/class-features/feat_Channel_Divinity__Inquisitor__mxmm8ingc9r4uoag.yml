      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
      Channel Divinity options.</p>

      <h2>Compelling Inquiry</h2>

      <p>When questioning a creature with which you share a language, you can
      use your Channel Divinity to compel it to speak the truth. The creature
      makes a Constitution saving throw or finds itself unable to be dishonest
      for 1 minute. Regardless of whether it succeeds or fails, you know the
      outcome of the saving throw.</p>

      <h2>Inquisitorial Challenge</h2>

      <p>As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to issue a
      challenge of combat to one creature you can see within 30 feet. The
      creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
      can&rsquo;t move more than 30 feet away from you and has disadvantage on
      attacks against creatures other than you for 1 minute.</p>
