      <p>At 10th level, your mastery of air can empower the lightning and
      thunder damage you cast even against creatures normally resistant to them.
      Lightning or thunder damage from your spells treats immunity to lighting
      or thunder as though it were lightning or thunder resistance, and ignores
      lightning or thunder resistance entirely. Additionally, any spell you cast
      that deals lightning or thunder damage deals additional damage equal to
      your intelligence modifier on one damage roll.</p>
