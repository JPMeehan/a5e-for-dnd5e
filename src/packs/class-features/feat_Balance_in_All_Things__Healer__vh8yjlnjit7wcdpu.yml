    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the damage you deal to your enemies radiates healing
      energy back to you and your allies. When you hit with a spell attack, you
      and any allies within 30 feet of you regain hit points equal to your
      Wisdom modifier + the spellâ€™s level. A creature cannot benefit from this
      effect more than once per short rest.<br></p>
