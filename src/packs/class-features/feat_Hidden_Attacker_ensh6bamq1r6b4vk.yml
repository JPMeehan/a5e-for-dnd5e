    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you excel at staying hidden from your
      enemy&rsquo;s sight even when on the attack. If you start your turn hidden
      from one or more creatures, you can activate this power to remain hidden
      from them until the start of your next turn. Attacking does not reveal
      your position, and you do not need&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">cover</span>&nbsp;to remain hidden. You can use
      this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining
      all uses when you finish a&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">short or
      long rest</span>.</p>
