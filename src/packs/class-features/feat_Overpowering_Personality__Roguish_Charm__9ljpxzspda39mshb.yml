      <p>Beginning at 18th level, your poise and charm allow you to impose your
      vision on the world. Choose one of the following options. You must be
      proficient in a skill in order to gain an expertise die from Overpowering
      Personality.</p><h3><strong>Roguish Charm</strong></h3><p>You gain an
      expertise die on Persuasion checks. After you spend a minute in
      conversation with a creature that is not hostile, you may make a
      Persuasion check opposed by its Insight. On a success, the creature is
      nonmagically charmed by you for 1 hour. The charm ends early if you or
      your allies harm the creature. Once you’ve used this feature successfully,
      you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
