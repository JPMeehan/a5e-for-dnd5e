      <p>Starting at 17th level, you can draw on the power of darkness to
      literally disappear and make your enemies forget you were ever there. You
      can use a bonus action to magically become&nbsp;invisible</span>&nbsp;for
      1 minute. Attacking does not break this invisibility.</p><p>In addition,
      each creature within 60 feet that sees you use this ability must make a
      Wisdom&nbsp;saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + you
      proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the
      creature&rsquo;s memories of you over the past hour tare erased; while
      they still remember the basic events of that time, their memories have
      been altered not to include you. The target&rsquo;s memories of actions
      you take after you use this ability are not affected.</p><p>Once
      you&rsquo;ve used this ability, you must finish a&nbsp;<span>long rest
      before you can do so again.</p>
