      <p>Starting at 17th level, you reach mastery of the way of the fist. When
      you make an unarmed strike, you score critical hits on a roll of 19–20. If
      you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits,
      your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17–20). In addition, when
      you use a bonus action to make an unarmed strike, it deals an additional
      damage die.</p><p>[[/r 1d4 #d4 die]] [[/r 1d6 #d6 die]] [[/r 1d8 #d8 die]]
      [[/r 1d10 #d10 die]] [[/r 1d12 #d12 die]]</p><p>If a creature is reduced
      to 0 hit points by your unarmed strikes, you can spend 3 exertion to make
      its body and soul be destroyed in an implosion. The target can’t be
      brought back from the dead, except with a wish spell.</p><p>When you hit a
      creature with two or more unarmed strikes in the same turn, you can spend
      3 exertion to force it to make a Constitution saving throw, dealing one
      effect from the list below on a failure. For each successful unarmed
      strike after the second, you can spend 1 exertion to deal one additional
      effect. For example, if you hit with four unarmed attacks, you can spend 5
      exertion to deal three effects. You can’t choose the same effect more than
      once, and on a successful saving throw all effects are
      negated.</p><ul><li><p>Deal additional damage equal to twice your martial
      arts die.</p></li><li><p>The creature is blinded and deafened for 1
      minute.</p></li><li><p>The creature is paralyzed for 1 minute. At the
      beginning of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw,
      ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li><li><p>The creature is
      knocked prone and becomes poisoned for 1 minute.</p></li><li><p>Healing
      features, spells, and traits have no effect on the creature until the
      beginning of your next turn.</p></li><li><p>The creature loses a spell
      slot from its highest available level.</p></li><li><p>The creature loses 6
      exertion.</p></li><li><p>The creature can’t use bonus actions, legendary
      actions, or reactions until the beginning of your next
      turn.</p></li><li><p>The creature gains a level of fatigue.</p></li></ul>
