      <p>When you take this archetype at 1st level, your study of eldritch
      warfare infuses your magical practice. You gain proficiency with four
      martial weapons of your choice, the History skill, and the History skill
      specialty <em>military history</em>. Finally, choose one of the following
      options, either Warrior&rsquo;s Curse or Combat Maneuvers:</p>

      <h2>Warrior's Curse</h2>

      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following
      effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>Choose magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage when you apply
      the curse. When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an
      additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at
      10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You gain a pool of defensive dice, which begins empty. Every time the
      cursed creature hits you with an attack, you gain a defensive die. You may
      spend one of your defensive dice as a reaction when you are hit with an
      attack, adding 1d4 to your AC against that attack and potentially turning
      the hit into a miss. You may not spend a defensive die on the attack that
      you acquired it from. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <h2>Combat Maneuvers</h2>

      <p>You learn to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency with the
      Cutting Omen and your choice of the Mist and Shade, Mirror&rsquo;s Glint,
      or Tempered Iron traditions. You learn one maneuver of your choice from
      traditions you are proficient with.</p>

      <p>You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus,
      regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use
      your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers
      Known column of Table: Martialist Maneuvers shows when you learn more
      maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver
      Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a
      given level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
      the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
      level from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>
