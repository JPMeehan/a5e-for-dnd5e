      <p><em>Prerequisite: 3rd level</em></p><p>Using a reflective object, such
      as an ordinary mirror or the smooth surface of water, you can commune with
      your patron or their emissary. You may do so during a short or long rest,
      receiving or conveying information related to your master&rsquo;s bidding.
      This entity may also use such surfaces to bridge communication with you on
      its own terms.<br style="box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;" /><br
      style="box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;" />You can also use this
      feature to cast&nbsp;augury&nbsp;without spending spell points. Casting
      the spell in this way does not require material components, although you
      do need a reflective surface by which your patron might appear to you.
      Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
