      <p dir="ltr">Also at 2nd level, you have trained with various weapons and
      skills that are especially useful in a coastal environment. You gain
      proficiency with nets and tridents, the Athletics skill, and the
      Primordial language (and its Aquan dialect). You also gain Athletics skill
      specialties swimming and diving. Finally, spells from the water school
      count as druid spells for you. You also may prepare an additional number
      of spells from the water school equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
