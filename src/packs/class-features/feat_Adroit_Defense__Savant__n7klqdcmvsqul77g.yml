      <p>You constantly analyze combat situations to improve your defensive
      posture, proactively interfering to guide attacks away from yourself.
      While you are wearing no armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity
      modifier + your Intelligence modifier. You cannot use a shield and still
      gain this benefit.</p><p>The savant is not proficient in armor by default,
      but might gain those proficiencies through archetypes, feats, or
      multiclassing. When you are wearing armor youâ€™re proficient in, you can
      use your Intelligence in place of your Dexterity to determine your AC.</p>
