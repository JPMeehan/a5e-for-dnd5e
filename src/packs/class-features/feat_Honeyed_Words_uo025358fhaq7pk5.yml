      <p>Starting at 6th level, you learn to weave magic directly into your very
      words and gesticulations. When you cast a bard spell, you can replace any
      vocalized components with speech and any seen components with gestures.
      Any observers with a passive Insight score equal to or less than your
      passive Deception score or passive Persuasion score do not see or hear you
      cast the spell. If you are making a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion
      check as part of your speech or gestures, the effects of the spell occur
      before the check is made.</p><p>Once you have used this feature a number
      of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
