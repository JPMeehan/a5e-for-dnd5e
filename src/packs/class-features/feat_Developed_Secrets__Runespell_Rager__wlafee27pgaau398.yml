      <p dir="ltr">The secretive study and occasionally violent lifestyle of
      most runespell ragers often requires a great deal of travel, giving you
      ample opportunity to learn survival secrets both mundane and
      magical.</p><p dir="ltr">At 2nd level you gain a developed secret. You may
      learn any berserker developed talent for which you meet the prerequisites,
      using your runespell rager levels in place of berserker levels. The
      Developed Secrets column of the Runespell Rager table shows when you learn
      more developed secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever you learn an additional
      developed secret, you may instead learn a warlock secret of the arcana
      instead. You may not learn more than one warlock secret of the arcana
      through this feature. You may use your runespell rager level in place of
      warlock levels to meet these prerequisites.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, you
      may use your spellcasting ability in place of your Strength ability to
      determine your carrying capacity, including the amount of Supply and the
      number of bulky items you can carry.&nbsp;</p>
