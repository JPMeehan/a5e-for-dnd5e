      <p>Your name is writ in water, and people easily forget your face despite
      any current fame you may currently enjoy. By taking 1 minute of
      preparation, you remove signifying details people usually associate you
      with (such as glasses, a scarf, or an outlandish outfit) and assume an
      alter ego who is totally forgettable. Anyone outside of close friends and
      contacts must make a DC 15 Intelligence check to attempt to remember your
      name, alias, or specific details about you; on a failure they remember
      only the most basic details but nothing sufficient to easily identify you,
      and they may not attempt another check until they encounter you again.
      Your Prestige Rating while assuming this alter ego is always treated as
      zero.</p>
