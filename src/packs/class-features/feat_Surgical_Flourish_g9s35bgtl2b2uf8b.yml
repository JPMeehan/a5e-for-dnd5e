    value: >-
      <p>When you have advantage on a melee attack and both dice results are
      high enough to hit, choose one of the creatureâ€™s limbs or eyes to
      debilitate. If the creature succeeds a Constitution saving throw, you
      debilitate that body part only until the end of your next turn. If it
      fails the saving throw, the body part is debilitated until it can take a
      short rest.</p><p>A creature cannot use a debilitated limb to attack, and
      cannot hold any items or effectively wear a shield with a debilitated
      limb. A creature with a debilitated leg has its speed reduced by half, it
      falls prone after using the Dash action, and it has disadvantage on
      Dexterity checks to balance. A creature with a debilitated eye has
      disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on
      ranged attack rolls.</p>
