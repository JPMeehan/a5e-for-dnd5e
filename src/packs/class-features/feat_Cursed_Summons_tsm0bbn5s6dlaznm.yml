      <p dir="ltr">At 6th level, you have the ability to turn a defeated foe
      into a temporarily loyal ally. When you kill a creature targeted by your
      Deathly Curse, or under the effects of one of your warlock spells, you can
      have your patron bind the dead creature to you, summoning a Shadow or a
      Spectre (your choice) from the corpse. The undead rolls its own
      initiative, has its own turns, and obeys your verbal commands. The undead
      disappears after 1 minute, when you are knocked unconscious, or when it is
      reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p dir="ltr">At 15th level, you can instead
      choose to have your patron reanimate the corpse as a Skeletal Champion, or
      Zombie Knight instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have used this feature,
      you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
