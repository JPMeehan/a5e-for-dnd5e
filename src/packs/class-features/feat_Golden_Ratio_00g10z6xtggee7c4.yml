      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Youâ€™ve been taking exact measurements of both
      natural and magical specimens, and believe true expressions of both can be
      reduced down to mathematics. When you select this field discovery you may
      select two 1st-level spells from the druid spell list. These are
      considered artificer spells for you and you may add them to the list of
      spells you can prepare. If you are at least a 7th level artificer when you
      select this field discovery, you may select 1st- or 2nd-level spells from
      the druid spell list instead. You may select this field discovery multiple
      times, choosing different druid spells each time.</p>
