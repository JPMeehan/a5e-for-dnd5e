      <p dir="ltr">Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, the
      intercession of elemental forces you call also offer up insights on things
      to come. When you cast a spell from your archetype spell list of 1st-level
      or higher, choose a number of targets up to the spell&rsquo;s level,
      chosen from yourself and friendly creatures you can see or hear within
      thirty feet of you. Distribute a number of elemental divination dice among
      these targets totalling the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Creatures can spend your elemental divination dice to add an
      expertise die on any roll they make. If a creature is subject to your
      elemental divination more than once, their remaining elemental divination
      dice stack with the new. All of a character&rsquo;s elemental divination
      dice disappear 1 minute after the last one they received.</p>
