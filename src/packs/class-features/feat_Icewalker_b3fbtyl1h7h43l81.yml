      <p dir="ltr">You ignore difficult terrain from ice and snow, and can even
      walk upon the top of snow. You do not have to make checks or saves to
      balance on icy surfaces. You gain a Climb speed equal to your speed, but
      only on icy surfaces. You can move on top of water at half your speed,
      temporarily freezing the water below your feet; the ice washes away and
      melts after you pass. If the air temperature is below freezing, you can
      choose to create a path of ice behind you for others to follow, but the
      path must remain anchored to a surface, or else it melts in 1 minute.</p>
