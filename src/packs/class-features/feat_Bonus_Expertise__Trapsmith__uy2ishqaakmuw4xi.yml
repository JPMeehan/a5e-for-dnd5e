      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
      Engineering and tinkerer’s tools, and you gain an expertise die on checks
      made with either, and when using thieves’ tools. For you, expertise dice
      in these skills and tools can be upgraded from d8 to d10, exceeding the
      usual limit on expertise dice.</p>
