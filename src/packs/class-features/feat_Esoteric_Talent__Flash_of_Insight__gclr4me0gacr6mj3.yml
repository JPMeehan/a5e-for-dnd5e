      <p>Also at 2nd level, you gain one of the following benefits, which
      represents a minor talent youâ€™ve picked up over the course of your
      studies.</p><h3><strong>Flash of Insight</strong></h3><p>You can use a
      bonus action to roll a d20, record the result, and choose a creature you
      can see within 30 feet. The next time that creature makes an attack roll,
      ability check, or saving throw, it takes that d20 result instead of
      rolling. If you use this feature again before finishing a short rest, you
      must sacrifice a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to do so.</p>
