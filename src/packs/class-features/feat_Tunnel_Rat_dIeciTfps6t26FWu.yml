      <p>You are very adept at digging and tunneling. While wielding a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.vqseoqiptkqkux3k]{Shovel}, you
      can dig a 5 foot by 5-foot wide tunnel through nonmagical sand, loose
      earth, loamy soil, mud, or snow (but not solid rock) at a speed of 5 feet
      every 15 minutes, which includes the time taken to shore up the tunnel and
      add support. You can dig pits and trenches open to the air at twice this
      speed. In addition, you may ignore the effects of roughing it due to
      environmental conditions while resting in a trench or hole.</p>
