      <p>At 20th level, you become an exemplar of either temporal or divine
      justice. Choose one of the following options:</p>

      <h3><strong>Order of Justice</strong></h3>

      <p>You receive the authority and funding to set up your own order. You
      gain a level 5 stronghold of average quality of the castle, temple, or
      training hall type, and two seasoned followers chosen from the diviner,
      healer, interpreter, sage, or smith types. At the Narrator&rsquo;s option,
      you can place this stronghold somewhere unusual or purchase upgrades for
      it at the normal cost as part of the acquisition process. You also gain
      the services of two NPCs of up to CR 5.</p>

      <h3><strong>Divine Certainty</strong></h3>

      <p>You can survey the scene of a grave injustice or atrocity and instantly
      know who is responsible, both for the actual action itself and anyone who
      ordered it. The responsible parties are immediately marked as per your
      Render Verdict ability (no save). Nothing short of the wish spell or the
      intervention of a deity can thwart this feature.</p>
