      <blockquote><p>At 1st level, you can modify your damaging spells to use
      divine energies.</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>When you
      cast a spell of 1st level or higher that does damage measured in a number
      of dice, you can swap any number of those dice out for an equal number of
      the next size down that do radiant or necrotic damage (your choice on a
      per-die basis) instead.</p><p>If the spell already measures its damage in
      <strong>d4</strong>s, it cannot be modified this way.</p><p>For example,
      you could substitute one of the <strong>d8</strong>s of thunder damage
      from a <em>thunderwave</em> spell with a <strong>d6</strong> of radiant
      damage instead.</p>
