      <p>When you are in the bounds of a settlement, as an action, you can
      summon a spectral law book containing all the rules of behavior for that
      place, written and unwritten, and the local power structure. The book is
      obviously magical and clearly not a solid object, cannot be damaged or
      taken from you, and persists until you dismiss it (no action required) or
      leave the bounds of the settlement. The book sheds bright light to a range
      of 5 feet and dim light to a range of 15 feet.</p><p>The amount of time it
      takes to read this book for a given community is up to the Narrator, but
      as an action, you can learn any of the following: </p><ul><li><p>Who is
      officially in charge of the area.</p></li><li><p>A brief summary of what
      sorts of behavior will win you favor or get you into
      trouble.</p></li><li><p>What deviations from common legal norms exist, if
      any. For example: if theft is legal here or wearing green clothing is
      not.</p></li><li><p>What rights you have in the settlement, if
      any.</p></li></ul><p>You may use this feature at will.</p>
