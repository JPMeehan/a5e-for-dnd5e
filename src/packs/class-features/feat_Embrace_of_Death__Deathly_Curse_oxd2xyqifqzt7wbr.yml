      <p dir="ltr">You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you
      can see within 30ft. The curse lasts 1 minute, ending early if the
      creature dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When you deal damage against the cursed
      creature, it takes an additional 1d4 Necrotic damage. This bonus increases
      by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 19th level.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain a pool of necrosis dice, which
      begins empty. When the cursed creature fails a saving throw, add one
      necrosis die to this pool. You can spend a necrosis die whenever you deal
      damage with your Eldritch Blast, or a spell of 1st level or higher that
      deals necrotic damage, to deal an additional 1d4 necrotic damage. The pool
      disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p dir="ltr">Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again
      until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
