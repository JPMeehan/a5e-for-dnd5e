      15th level, others have learned to trust your example and confidently
      follow in your footsteps. Whenever you succeed on a Strength or Dexterity
      saving throw against an effect, any of your allies who observed you gain
      advantage on their next saving throw against the same effect in the next
      10 minutes. Likewise, whenever you succeed on an Acrobatics, Animal
      Handling, Athletics, Stealth, or Survival check, any allies that observed
      you have advantage on their next check to perform the same activity using
      the same skill in the next 10 minutes. This ability applies even if your
      check or saving throw would otherwise be considered simultaneous with that
      of your ally, such as when making a group ability check, or if you and an
      ally are both targeted by the same spell. If the check or saving throw is
      simultaneous, you may also choose one ally to automatically succeed on the
      check or saving throw instead of gaining advantage.</span></p>
