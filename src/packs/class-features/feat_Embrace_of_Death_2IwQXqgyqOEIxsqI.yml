      <p>When you take this archetype at 1st level, your knowledge of
      necromantic magics far exceeds most, and your prolonged presence around
      said magic has had a profound effect on you. You gain proficiency in
      religion, as well as the undead speacialty.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, whenever you use your Eldritch Blast feature, you may
      choose to deal necrotic damage instead of force damage.</p>

      <p>You also choose one of the following:</p>

      <h2>Deathly Curse</h2>

      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30ft. The curse lasts 1 minute, ending early if the creature dies,
      you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>

      <p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an
      additional 1 d4 necrotic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th
      level, and again at 15th and 10th level.</p>

      <p>You gain a pool of necrosis dice, which begins empty. When the cursed
      creature fails a saving throw, add one necrosis die to this pool. You can
      spend a necrosis die whenever you deal damage with your Eldritch Blast, or
      a spell of 1st level or higher that deals necrotic damage, to deal an
      additional 1d4 necrotic damage. The pool disappears when you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h2>Undead Resilience</h2>

      <p>You gain resistance to necrotic and poison damage, as well as an
      expertise die on saving throws against poison.</p>
