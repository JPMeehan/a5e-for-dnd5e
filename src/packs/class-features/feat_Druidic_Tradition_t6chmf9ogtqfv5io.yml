      <p>At 6th level, choose one of the following:</p>

      <h2>Harvest Boon</h2>

      <p>You always have the plant growth spell prepared, and it doesn&rsquo;t
      count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition,
      you can cast plant growth without expending a spell slot when casting the
      spell using the Enlarged option.</p>

      <h2>Traditional Spells</h2>

      <p>When you first gain this feature, select three spells from the air,
      beasts, earth, healing, nature, plants, terrain, water, or weather schools
      as your traditional spells. You can select up to two additional
      traditional spells from those schools when you reach 7th, 9th, and 11th
      level in this class. You always have your traditional spells prepared, and
      they don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each
      day. If you select a spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the druid spell
      list, the spell is a druid spell for you.</p>

      <h2>Transfer Vitality</h2>

      <p>You can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast cure wounds at
      a spell level equal to one-third your druid level. In addition, once
      between long rests, when you restore a creature&rsquo;s hit points, you
      can choose to restore twice as many hit points as normal.</p>
