      <p>At 8th level, you can spend 1 minute studying your environment and
      attempt a DC 15 Insight check. On a success, you notice something of
      significance, such as a coded message, a secret door, a hidden chest, or
      the tracks or other signs of a nearby creature. The nature of the
      information you intuit depends on the location you are in&mdash;the
      Narrator can always decide there is nothing for you to intuit about your
      current location or may offer a clue leading to a more relevant location
      instead. Once you have learned something with this feature, you must
      finish a&nbsp;long rest before you can do so again.</p>
