      <p>You gain an expertise die on Performance checks. You can spend 10
      minutes practicing a skill of your choice, at the end of which you make a
      Performance check. You can use this result to replace the die roll of one
      ability check you make using that skill in the next hour. You may decide
      to use this feature after seeing the die roll. Once you have used this
      feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
