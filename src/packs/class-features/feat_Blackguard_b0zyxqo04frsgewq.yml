      <p>At 20th level, you fully become a terrifying figure out of nightmare
      and legend. You gain the following abilities:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>Your fell physiology becomes incredibly durable. You gain immunity to
      ongoing damage, and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and
      piercing damage from non-magical sources.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Your blood becomes a poisonous black ichor. You may inflict 2 points of
      necrotic damage to yourself to poison a weapon with your blood for one
      round. A creature struck by a weapon so poisoned takes 2d6 additional
      necrotic damage per hit and must make a constitution saving throw or gain
      the poisoned condition for one minute. Creatures must save against each
      hit separately. Creatures within 5 feet of you that deal more than 10
      points of piercing or slashing damage to you must make a dexterity save
      against your maneuver DC or suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Each applicable
      instance of damage triggers this effect separately.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.k25cbr3kk1rdtq3j]{Menacing
      Countenance} becomes so terrible that it tears at the minds of those who
      witness you. Creatures that fail their save against your Menacing
      Countenance take 2d4 of psychic damage and are rattled until they can
      shake off the effects. Creatures that fail their saves by 10 or more
      instead become supernaturally terrified, and will flee from you at maximum
      speed by the most direct route possible, heedless of hazards along their
      path, until you are out of sight.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

    description: "<p>A daunted creature acts in various ways depending on the situation and the Narratorâ€™s discretion. Most non-hostile daunted creatures simply find somewhere else to be. Hostile daunted creatures might also excuse themselves (often making a show of bravado before doing so). A daunted creature that attacks you takes a -1d4 penalty to their attack rolls.\_</p>\n<p>A creature engaged in combat with you can re-attempt their save against this effect at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.
