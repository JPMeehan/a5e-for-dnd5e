      <p>Also at 1st level you gain a special ability tied to the experiments
      that were pressed upon you. Your bonded power must be of the same line as
      your flesh and bone selection.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Baleful Gaze</strong>: As an action you may attempt to stun
      all creatures in a 15ft cone. Creatures in the area must make a
      Constitution save against your spell DC. On a failure they are stunned
      until the beginning of their next turn. You may use this ability once per
      short rest, or expend a sorcery point as a bonus action to recover use of
      it.</li>

      <li><strong>Beastmantle</strong>: You gain a Bite attack as a natural
      weapon which deals 1d6+Str piercing damage. When you cast a spell with a
      range of touch you may use your bite attack as part of the spellcasting
      action to deliver the spell. In addition you grow a long tail with a
      stinger. As a bonus action on your turn you may use your tail as a natural
      finesse weapon to attack. On a hit you deal 1d4 piercing damage and poison
      damage equal to your Constitution modifier.</li>

      <li><strong>Shapeshifter</strong>: You gain the ability to change your
      body significantly. As an action you may drastically alter your
      appearance, including height by up to a foot, weight by up to 50lbs, and
      heritage. If you attempt to mimic a specific creature you gain advantage
      on any performance or deception checks based on appearance. You may also
      choose to instead alter your body to gain a climb or swim speed equal to
      your normal speed. Any change requires an action and lasts up to an hour,
      though you may choose to end the effect normally. You may use this ability
      once per short rest, or expend a sorcery point as a bonus action to
      recover use of it. This ability does not trigger Detect Magic or similar
      effects.</li>
