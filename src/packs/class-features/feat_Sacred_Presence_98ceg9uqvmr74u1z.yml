      <p>At 9th level, you bring the true presence of your ideals wherever you
      go. Choose one of the following.</p><h2>Cosmic Idealist</h2><p>Your moral
      compass aligns with the transcendent forces of the multiverse. Choose
      Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, or one of the following: Chaotic and Evil,
      Chaotic and Good, Lawful and Evil, or Lawful and Good. You gain the chosen
      alignment trait or alignment traits. You can identify creatures that have
      the same alignment traits as you, and you have advantage when making
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks against them.</p><p>Additionally,
      you do not suffer negative effects from being on a plane with which you
      share an alignment trait.</p><h2>Eyes of the Heart</h2><p>You have a way
      of really seeing folk&rsquo;s inner character. When you succeed on a
      contested Insight check, if the opposing creature&rsquo;s Charisma score
      is equal to or less than your spell save DC, for the next 24 hours you do
      not need to make any further checks to recognize whenever that creature is
      lying, telling the truth, or excluding information.</p><h2>Spiritual
      Salve</h2><p>Your spiritual mindset has given you unique insights that can
      help you and your companions endure hardships. Your constant
      encouragements and proverbs allow allies within 30 feet of you to reroll a
      Constitution check or saving throw that they fail. If they do so, they
      must use the new roll. This feature cannot be used on saving throws made
      to maintain concentration on a spell. Once a creature has used your
      Spiritual Salve to make a reroll, it cannot do so again until it has
      finished a long rest.</p>
