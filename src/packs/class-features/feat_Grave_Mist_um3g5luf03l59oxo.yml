      <p>Also at 10th level, you gain the ability to conjure up a sinister fog
      that moves with you. The fog extends 20 feet from you and spreads around
      corners. You can see through the fog as if it was not there, but other
      creatures treat everything in the fog as lightly obscured. In addition,
      creatures in the fog other than you that are immune to necrotic damage are
      treated as resistant to it instead, creatures resistant to necrotic damage
      are treated as if they were not resistant, and creatures that are not
      resistant to necrotic damage are treated as vulnerable. Once you have used
      this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum
      once), you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
