      <p>If you choose, creatures you turn instead regard you as their master
      for the duration. While they are under this effect, you may use your
      action to issue simple commands (no more than a sentence or two) which
      they are compelled to obey. They will not take any action that is
      obviously harmful to them, and so will not leap from a great height, jump
      onto a sword, or purposefully self-inflict any damage. They follow the
      command until you issue a new one.</p>
