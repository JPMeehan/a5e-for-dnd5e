      <p>At 15th level when you smite a target or critically hit them with a
      weapon attack they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
      DC or be frightened until the end of their next turn. Whenever you reduce
      a creature to 0 hit points all hostile creatures within 30ft of the
      creature you felled must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until
      the end of their next turn.</p><p>In addition, when a creature within 5ft
      of you hits you with an attack you may use your reaction to attack them
      back, critically hitting on a 17-20 when you do so. You may do so a number
      of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when
      you finish a long rest.</p>
