      <p>A mere look from you can set creatures and structures aflame. As a
      bonus action, you may select a number of targets up to your Charisma
      modifier you can see within 120 feet. They all take 1d6 fire damage and
      1d6 ongoing fire damage until a creature spends an action to extinguish
      the flames.</p>
