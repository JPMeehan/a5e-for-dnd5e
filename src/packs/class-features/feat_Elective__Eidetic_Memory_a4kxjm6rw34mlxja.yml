      <p>Your memory is nearly perfect. You can accurately recall anything
      you’ve read or seen in the past month. Additionally, when retreading a
      travel route you’ve traveled in the past month, you have advantage on
      ability checks made against environmental hazards on that route, unless
      the landscape has been significantly altered in that time.</p>
