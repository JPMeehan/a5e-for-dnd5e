      <p>Also at 2nd level, when an attack you make is a critical hit, you can
      immediately prepare a trick without needing to spend a bonus action. If
      you already have a trick prepared, you can replace it. If you have a
      flourish prepared, you may use it on this critical hit, before choosing to
      prepare a new trick.</p>
