      <p>At 15th level, the massive variety of different combat techniques you
      have learned allows you to pick out the occasional moment to strike with
      particular viciousness. Once per turn, when you hit with a weapon attack,
      you can choose to have the attack do additional damage equal to the number
      of combat traditions you know at least one maneuver from. Once you have
      used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you
      canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
