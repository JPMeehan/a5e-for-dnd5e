      <p>At 6th level your methodology to battle seeps further into the way you
      interact with others&mdash;and how they interact with you. Choose one of
      the following:</p>

      <h2>Forceful</h2>

      <p>People respond favorably to your vigor. You can always choose to use
      Constitution when making Persuasion checks.</p>

      <p>In addition, in every settlement you visit you inspire a number of
      followers equal to your proficiency bonus. Your followers perform minor
      tasks to help you while you are there, feed you and your allies, carry
      your belongings to nearby destinations, share their mount animals, reveal
      some of their secrets to try and gain your favor, and ask you for help
      before turning to the authorities with a problem.</p>

      <h2>Mighty</h2>

      <p>You turn your toughness into a tool when imposing upon others. You can
      always choose to use Constitution when making Intimidation checks.</p>

      <p>In addition, when you enter a tavern or other social gathering, you can
      make a DC 15 Intimidation check while loudly declaring that you are
      looking for something or someone. On a success, most of the people there
      look at and otherwise point out whoever they believe is the person you are
      looking for or the person most likely to know about what you are
      seeking.</p>

      <h2>Scary</h2>

      <p>It&rsquo;s commonly thought that it&rsquo;s best not to ask you for too
      much clarification or detail. You can always choose to use Constitution
      when making Deception checks.</p>

      <p>In addition, when you fail a Deception check against a creature, it
      makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to your passive Deception
      score. On a failure, it thinks twice about your dishonesty and your
      Deception check becomes a success.</p>
