      <p>You are loyal to a specific nation, lord, organization, or other
      authority. While you are in good standing with that authority and are
      within their area of influence, you and your allies can easily find free
      food and lodging, and creatures with a CR lower than yours that are also
      loyal to that authority may perform simple tasks at your request. You lose
      good standing with that authority if you go against their
      wishes.</p><p>Consult the Narrator on authorities within the&nbsp;campaign
      setting, their wishes, and what will keep or return you to good standing
      with them.</p>
