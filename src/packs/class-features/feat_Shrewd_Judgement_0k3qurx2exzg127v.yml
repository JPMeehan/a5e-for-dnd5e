      <p>Beginning at 8th level, your ability to read others makes you as
      dangerous in conversation as you are in a dark alley. Choose one of the
      following options.&nbsp;You must be proficient in a skill or tool in order
      to gain an expertise die from Shrewd Judgment.</p><h2>Quick
      Frisk</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks. You can
      touch a target to learn what they are carrying. Make a Sleight of Hand
      check opposed by the target&rsquo;s Perception. On a success, you learn
      what types of objects they are carrying. If they are carrying coins, you
      know the approximate number. For the next 24 hours, any Sleight of Hand
      checks you make against the target have advantage. On a failure, you
      can&rsquo;t use Quick Frisk against that target for 24
      hours.</p><h2>Social Expertise</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on checks
      made with one of the following skills: Intimidation, Performance, or
      Persuasion.</p><h2>Spot Tell</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Insight
      checks. Whenever a creature makes a Deception check opposed by your
      Insight check and you win the opposed check, you also learn to recognize
      signs that the target is bluffing. For the next 24 hours, you have
      advantage on Insight checks made against the target.</p><h2>Tricky
      Interrogation</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When
      you ask a yes or no question to a creature you can see, you can make a
      Deception check opposed by the target&rsquo;s Deception check. On a
      success, you learn whether the target believes the answer to be yes or no,
      even if they didn&rsquo;t reply. On a failure, you can&rsquo;t use Tricky
      Interrogation against that target for 24 hours.</p>
