      <p>You do not need preparation to come up with a convincing fake persona,
      background, and excuse to cover anything suspicious you are doing. You can
      gain advantage on Deception checks to pretend to be someone else. However,
      the ruse won’t hold up to prolonged scrutiny. If you spend more than a few
      minutes in someone’s presence, you must make a new Deception check with
      disadvantage to maintain the ruse.</p>
