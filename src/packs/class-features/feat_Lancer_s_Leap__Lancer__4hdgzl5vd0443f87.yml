      <p>Also at 6th level you may perform the Lancer’s Leap, a special combat
      maneuver that only lancers gain. This maneuver does not count against your
      maneuvers known, and can be used with any other maneuver. Once you have
      used the Lancer’s Leap you must complete a short or long rest before using
      it, again. If you spend 3 exertion points before a short or long rest, the
      use of this ability recharges.</p>
