      <p>At 20th level, your capacity for drawing a crowd reaches dizzying new
      heights. As an action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to start
      an epic performance that lasts for 1d4 rounds. During that time, you can
      choose up to 50 creatures that are within 120 feet of you. Each creature
      able to hear or see your Epic Performance makes a Charisma saving throw
      against your bard spell save DC. If a creature fails its saving throw, it
      is charmed by you for the duration plus 6 days, or until you or your
      companions do anything harmful to it. A charmed creature regards you as a
      friendly acquaintance. </p><p>The performance ends early if you are
      incapacitated or silenced, or if you voluntarily end it (no action
      required). At the end of the duration, you can expend an additional use of
      Bardic Inspiration to extend the duration by 1d4 rounds. </p><p>When your
      Epic Performance lasts at least 1 minute, at the end of the duration you
      can target each charmed creature as if using the mass suggestion spell
      cast at 9th-level. Creatures do not make saving throws to resist this
      effect. The commands you give a charmed creature are not obvious, and
      other creatures must make a Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your
      Charisma (Performance) check to understand that you are doing anything
      more than giving a performance. You can give each creature its own set of
      commands, but can only give out 6 different sets of commands. </p><p>Once
      you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
