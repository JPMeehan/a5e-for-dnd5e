      <p>At 10th level, you can call upon the spirits of the departed to protect
      you in combat. As an action, you call forth a swirling mass of spectral
      forms around yourself. You gain temporary hit points equal to your
      proficiency bonus + your spellcasting modifier + warlock level. While you
      have any of these temporary hit points remaining, you are lightly
      obscured. Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
