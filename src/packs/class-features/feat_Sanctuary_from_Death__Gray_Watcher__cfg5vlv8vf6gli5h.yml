      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">If an undead creature
      wishes to attack you or cast a harmful spell against you, it must first
      make a wisdom save against your spell save DC. On a failure it must choose
      a different target for its attack or the attack is wasted. An undead that
      is not mindless is aware of this ability before it tries to attack. If you
      attack an undead creature, cast a spell targeting it, or cause it to take
      damage, you lose this protection against that undead creature for the next
      24 hours.</p>
