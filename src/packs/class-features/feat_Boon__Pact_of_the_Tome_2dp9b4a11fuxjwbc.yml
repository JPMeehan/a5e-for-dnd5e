      <p>Aware of your drive for knowledge, you awaken to find a grimoire left
      in your pack by your patron: a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips.
      While the book is in your possession, you know these cantrips and they are
      treated as warlock spells. They don&rsquo;t count against your number of
      cantrips known. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1 hour
      ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony destroys
      the previous book. The book is collected by your patron when you die.</p>
