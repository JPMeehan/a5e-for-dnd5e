      well as leveraging your natural interpersonal skills to enhance your
      magic. Choose one of the following:</p>

      Allure</strong></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You gain an expertise
      die on Persuasion checks, and may always choose to use your spellcasting
      ability modifier on Persuasion checks, in addition when a creature
      succeeds on a saving throw against a spell you cast that would charm them,
      you may make a Persuasion check opposed by their saving throw. On a
      success, they must reroll their save and take the second result. If the
      spell targets more than one creature, you may only force one of them to
      re-roll.</p>
