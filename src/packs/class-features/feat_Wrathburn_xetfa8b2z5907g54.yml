      <p>At 3rd level, you may cast berserker spells while you are raging, but
      it is taxing for you. Whenever you cast a spell while raging, you take
      psychic damage equal to the spellâ€™s level, which is applied directly to
      your hit points, bypassing your rage hit points. You can concentrate on
      berserker spells while raging, but you take 1 point of psychic damage at
      the beginning of each round while you do.</p><p>Choose five multiclass
      spells associated with the berserker class and add them to your berserker
      spells known. They do not count against your total spells
      known.</p><p>This trait does not permit you to cast or concentrate on
      spells from any other sources while raging.</p>
