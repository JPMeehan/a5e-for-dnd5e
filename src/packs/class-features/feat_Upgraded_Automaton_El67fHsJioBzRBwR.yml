      <p>You improve your automaton. Its armor class increases to 14, its hit
      points increase to 35, and you choose one of the following upgrades. You
      can only upgrade a function your automaton already possesses.</p>

      <p><strong>Upgraded Medic:</strong> If your automaton has the Autonomous
      Medic option, it now heals for 2d8 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Upgraded Weapon:</strong> If your automaton has the Autonomous
      Weapon option, it now deals damage equal to 2d8 + your Intelligence
      modifier and its range increases to 150/600.</p>

      <p><strong>Upgraded Scanner:</strong> If your automaton has the Autonomous
      Scanner option, it now performs the Search action automatically on your
      turn, not requiring an action from you. You must still specify what
      it&rsquo;s looking for.</p>

      <p><strong>Additional Automaton Function:</strong> Your automaton gains a
      second set of capabilities. For example, if you had selected the
      Autonomous Weapon option at level 5, you could select the Autonomous Medic
      option now.</p>
