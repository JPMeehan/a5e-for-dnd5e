      <p>At 15th level, if damage reduces a beast you are the guardian ranger of
      to 0 hit points, it makes a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal
      to 10 + the attack modifier of the damaging attack. On a success, the
      beast drops to 1 hit point instead.</p>

      <p>A beast can use this feature once between long rests.</p>
