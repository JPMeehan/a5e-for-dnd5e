      <p>Starting at 15th level, your power is so great that you no longer need
      to know a heretic’s name or wrongdoing in order to bestow punishment—it’s
      as if you can read their soul. When you use Mark of the Heretic, you need
      only point at a creature to mark it. Additionally, when a creature marked
      by this feature dies, you can apply the mark to another creature you can
      see within 30 feet of you without expending another use of Mark of the
      Heretic.</p>
