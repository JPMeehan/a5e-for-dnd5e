      <p>When you select this archetype at 2nd level beneficial winds aid in
      your movement as you weave your magic. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st
      level or higher you movement speed is increased by 10 feet and attacks of
      opportunity have disadvantage against you until the end of your next turn.
      This ability does not function while in a vacuum, underwater, or otherwise
      not surrounded by air.</p>
