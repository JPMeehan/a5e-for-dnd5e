      <p>When you start a short rest, you can choose a topic to study from the
      library, browsing through its spectral volumes. You have disadvantage on
      all Perception checks while studying from the library. When you finish
      your long rest, you may make a single Arcana, Culture, Engineering,
      History, or Nature check with advantage. If you succeed on your check, the
      next attack you make against a creature of the corresponding type (see
      below) is made with advantage.</p>
