      <p>Also at 3rd level, your martial direction improves the efficiency of
      your allies&rsquo; attacks against an enemy you focus their attention on.
      You can use a bonus action to choose a creature you can see within 30
      feet. Until the start of your next turn, creatures able to hear or see you
      gain an expertise die on attacks made against that creature.</p>
