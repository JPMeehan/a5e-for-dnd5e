      dir="ltr">You cast your gaze inward, and a hidden place reveals itself to
      you. Name a specific, immovable location on the same plane that you are
      seeking and spend 1 sorcery point. After 10 minutes of continuous focus,
      you know the distance and direction of the location from your current
      position.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">By spending an additional sorcery point you also learn of one
      previously unknown obstacle that stands between you and the destination.
      At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, information about this obstacle may
      range from cryptic or crystal clear. Spending any additional points on
      subsequent uses of this feature does not reveal any additional obstacles
      but may yield new information about the obstacle.</p>
