    value: >-
      <p>When you encounter a shed piece of a creature (such as a lock of hair,
      bloody bandage, a scale, or a tooth), you can touch that object and
      instantly attune to it as if it were a magic item. If you are carrying the
      shed piece and attuned to it when you see the creature from which it
      originated, you immediately know that it belongs to that creature, at
      which point the attunement ends. At the Narratorâ€™s discretion, you may
      learn additional cryptic information from being attuned to such
      things.</p>
