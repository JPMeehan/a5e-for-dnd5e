      <p>At 6th level, you are able to use your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.s4iiatrup3e3virw]{Channel
      Divinity} to see and hear through the eyes of another for 1 minute. When
      using this feature, you become blinded and deafened to your surroundings
      and sense through a creature you name. As long as the creature is alive
      and on the same plane of existence, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
      failure, you can see what it sees and hear what it hears. An unconscious
      creature automatically fails its save, but only hears (it sees nothing).
      You cannot see through the eyes of a blinded creature, or hear through the
      ears of a deafened creature. If the creature is dead or protected from
      divination magic this feature has no effect. On a successful save, a
      creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>
