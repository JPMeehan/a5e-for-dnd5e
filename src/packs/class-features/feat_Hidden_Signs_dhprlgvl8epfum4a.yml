      <p>You gain an expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks. You can use body
      language and hidden hand signals to communicate a short message to some
      observers while hiding it from others. Make a Sleight of Hand check
      opposed by the Insight checks of observers from whom you want to hide your
      communication. On a success, a creature is not aware that you sent a
      message. On a failure, the creature is aware that you signaled but
      doesn&rsquo;t know the content of your message. If you fail by 5 or more,
      the creature learns your message.</p>
