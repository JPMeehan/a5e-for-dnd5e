      <p>Beginning at 11th level, the first time each round you hit with an
      unarmed attack, the target suffers additional necrotic damage based on the
      light level. If the target is in bright light, it takes an additional 1d4
      necrotic damage. If it is in dim light, the damage is 1d6 instead. If it
      is in darkness, the damage is 1d8, and if it is in magical darkness, the
      damage is 1d10.</p>
