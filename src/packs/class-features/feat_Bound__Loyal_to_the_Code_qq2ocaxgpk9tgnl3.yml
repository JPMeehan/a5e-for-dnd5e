      <p>You are loyal to a specific code of honor. You gain an expertise die on
      Persuasion checks. However, whenever you break your code you suffer a
      level of strife and instead have disadvantage on Persuasion checks for the
      following 7 days. Choose one of the following codes to
      keep:</p><ul><li><p>I will never harm a creature that has
      surrendered.</p></li><li><p>I will never steal from a living
      soul.</p></li><li><p>I will never let a lie pass my
      lips.</p></li></ul><p>Alternatively, consult the Narrator for any codes
      specific to the campaign setting.</p>
