      <p dir="ltr">At 6th level, your Eldritch Blast becomes more vicious. If
      you know Eldritch Ray, Eldritch Scythe, Eldritch Whip, or Eldritch
      Disturbance, follow the rules detailed in the Warlock section of the
      Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">If you know Eldritch
      Chant, at 5th level you may target two creatures with one use of Eldritch
      Chant. This increases to three creatures at 11th level, and four creatures
      at 17th level. If a creature succeeds on its save against Eldritch Chant,
      you may target it again with additional uses of Extra Blast.</p><p
      dir="ltr">In addition, when a creature fails its save against Eldritch
      Chant you may choose to roll one Chant die, expending it. The creature is
      Confused for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled.</p>
