      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Witches have an
      unparalleled mastery of ritual magic. A 9th level, you can cast any witch
      spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In
      addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the
      following abilities:</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Book of
      Dreams</strong></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You may select one
      ritual spell on your spell list and add it to a dream journal. Once per
      long rest while sleeping or trancing, you may ritually cast one of the
      spells in your journal. Each time you gain a witch level, you may add
      another ritual spell you know to the list. In addition, you always have
      the dream spell prepared, it does not count against the number of prepared
      spells, and you may ritually cast it even though it does not have the
      ritual tag, but only while you are sleeping or trancing.</p>
