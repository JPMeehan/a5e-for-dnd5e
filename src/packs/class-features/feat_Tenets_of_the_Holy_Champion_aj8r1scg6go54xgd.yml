      <p>All holy champions hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Lead by Example. </strong>Strive to embody the principles of
      your deity, and inspire others to do the same.</li>

      <li><strong>Life In Service.</strong> When your deity calls, you answer,
      and all you do is in dedication to them.</li>

      <li><strong>Quick of Mind.</strong> Steel yourself against psychic attacks
      that may sway you from service.</li>

      <li><strong>Strong of Body. </strong>Peak physical condition must be
      maintained, in order to serve to the best of your abilities.</li>

      </ul>
