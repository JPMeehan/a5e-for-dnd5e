      <p>When you choose this archetype at level 2, your unarmed damage becomes
      necrotic damage, and you may use your Intelligence bonus instead of your
      Strength bonus when calculating your unarmed damage.</p><p>Additionally,
      you learn how to use the very life force of your victims. Whenever you
      deal necrotic damage to a living target with a CR of &frac14; or higher,
      you gain half the damage dealt as temporary hit points. You can never have
      more of these temporary hit points than twice your proficiency bonus, and
      you may not benefit from temporary hit points from more than one creature
      at a time.</p><p>Finally, all spells of the necromancy school become
      wizard spells for you (see the full list at the end of this archetype
      description).</p>
