      <p>At 6th level you gain an expertise die on death saving throws. You also
      gain the ability to resist the pull of death. When you are reduced to 0
      hit points but not killed outright you may spent a point of exertion and
      choose one of the following effects:</p><h2>Fight Through Death</h2><p>You
      remain conscious and able to act while dying at 0 hit points. While at 0
      hit points your unarmed strikes deal additional necrotic damage equal to
      your martial arts die and if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points you
      gain a successful death saving throw. You still suffer failed death saving
      throws from taking damage as normal. If you attain 3 failed death saves
      you die; if you attain 3 successful death saving throws you regain 1 hit
      point.</p><h2>Long Death</h2><p>Increase the number of death saving throws
      you can fail before dying by your proficiency bonus.</p>
