      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">At 10th level you may
      use an action to cause any number of humanoids, giants, fey, or
      monstrosities to make a wisdom save against your spell save DC.
      Monstrosities are only affected if the have an intelligence of 7 or
      higher.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">On a failure, they
      are entranced by you until the start of your next turn. Their movement
      speed is 0 and they are incapacitated. This effect ends early if they take
      any damage, or if another creature uses their action to shake them out of
      it. At the start of your next turn, if any creatures are still affected,
      you may expend an additional use of this ability to extend the effect.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You may use this
      ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all
      expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
