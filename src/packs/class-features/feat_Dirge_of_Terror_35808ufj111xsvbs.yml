      <p>At 14th level, you learn to emit a terrifying clamor that causes your
      opponents terrible distress. As an action, you may spend a use of your
      Bardic Inspiration to play a Dirge of Terror. Enemy creatures in a 15-foot
      cone must make a <strong>Wisdom save against your spell save DC or take
      4d6 psychic damage, gain a level of strife and become frightened for one
      minute.</strong> Creatures that succeed on their Wisdom save take damage
      as normal, but are not frightened and do not gain levels of
      strife.</p><p>Creatures that fail by 5 or more suffer a mild heart attack.
      Such a creature must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC
      or acquire two levels of fatigue and are stunned until the end of their
      next turn.</p>
