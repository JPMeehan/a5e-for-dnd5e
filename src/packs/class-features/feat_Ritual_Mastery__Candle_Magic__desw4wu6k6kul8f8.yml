      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Witches have an
      unparalleled mastery of ritual magic. A 9th level, you can cast any witch
      spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In
      addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the
      following abilities.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Book of
      Dreams</strong></s></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Coven
      Casting</strong></s></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Ritual
      Attire</strong></s></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Candle
      Magic</strong></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You may spend an
      amount of time equal to 1 hour + the casting time of any ritual spell you
      know to create a candle imbued with its power. Whenever any creature
      lights this candle, they gain benefits as if they had ritually cast the
      spell.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">A candle will burn
      for the duration of the spell contained within, and while burning cannot
      be put out by non-magical means. The creature that lit the candle can
      choose to extinguish it to end the spell early. Doing so saves any unused
      duration to be used later, though the duration must be spent in 1 minute
      increments.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">A witch may maintain
      a number of candles created in this fashion equal to their proficiency
      bonus, and if they attempt to craft another one while at this limit, the
      oldest one they made loses its magic. They must also have access to the
      materials necessary for candle making to do so, though the cost involved
      in doing so is negligible.</p>
