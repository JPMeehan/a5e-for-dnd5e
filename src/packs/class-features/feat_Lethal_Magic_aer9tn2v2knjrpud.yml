      <p>Also at 14th level, your ability to infuse poison into your spells
      improves. When you cast a spell with a single target, you may expend a
      dose of any poison (common or named). If the target is struck by a spell
      requiring an attack roll or fails its save against a spell requiring a
      saving throw, it is also subjected to the effects of the poison. If the
      poison’s save DC is lower than your spell save DC, it increases to match
      your spell save DC. Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again
      until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
