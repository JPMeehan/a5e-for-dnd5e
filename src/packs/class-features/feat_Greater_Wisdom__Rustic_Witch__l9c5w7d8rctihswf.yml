      for the next week.</p><p>You can also use 3 rare herbs and a minute of
      work to create a healing potion (superior), and any healing potion you
      craft heals additional hit points equal to your spellcasting ability
      modifier. Basic, advanced, or potent poisons you craft deal additional
      damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and their DC is
