      <p>At 2nd level, after much contemplation and communion with your greater
      entity, you pledge to uphold certain standards of behavior beyond what is
      necessary for adventure. In return, your greater entity grants you one of
      the following related boons. When you fail to uphold this pledge, you lose
      any benefits from it until 24 hours after you finish a long rest and
      rededicate yourself.</p><h2>Chaste</h2><p>In exchange for forgoing
      pleasures of the heart and flesh, you are hardened to the persuasions of
      others. Add your Wisdom modifier to any saving throws made to resist being
      charmed. You also gain one skill specialty chosen from Insight,
      Persuasion, or Religion.</p><h2>Destitute</h2><p>In exchange for forgoing
      material luxury, vendors who are not explicitly opposed to your greater
      entity are compelled to give you heavy discounts of up to 20%, and inkeeps
      offer free lodging.</p><h2>Devotional Integrity</h2><p>You adhere to a
      strict code of morality and ethics. When an action you take is honest and
      non-violent, until the end of your turn you are immune to the rattled
      condition and you do not suffer disadvantage or penalties on Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma checks made as part of that action.</p><h2>Image of
      the Divine</h2><p>You exhibit a uniform, makeup, tattoo, or body
      modification indicating your higher entity or religious order. Creatures
      have advantage when discerning your religious identity. You gain advantage
      on saving throws against fear and ability checks made against
      Intimidation. You also gain one skill specialty chosen from Insight,
      Intimidation, or Persuasion.</p><h2>Merciful</h2><p>In exchange for
      forgoing bloodshed&mdash;torture, attacking unconscious creatures, and
      dealing lethal wounds to creatures you reduce to 0 hit points&mdash;you
      are yourself granted mercy. When you have already succeeded on two death
      saving throws, you have advantage on death saving throws.</p><h2>Rule of
      Ritual</h2><p>You make formal religious observances and perform ritual
      timekeeping. You can spend 1 hour during a long rest to make these
      observances, and if you do you only need 4 hours of sleep instead of the
      normal 6. You learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ljixftygfhi0sfsf]{Guidance}
      cantrip if you do not already know it, and when you grant expertise dice
      with a spell of 1st-level or higher, the expertise die you grant increases
      by one step.</p><h2>Secrecy</h2><p>Your mission from your deity requires
      you to work undercover, concealing your true self with a secret identity.
      In exchange for forgoing the pleasure of true connection and friendship,
      you gain an expertise die on Deception checks.</p><h2>Severity</h2><p>In
      exchange for forgoing weaknesses such as helping or protecting others
      (except when it serves you), you add your Wisdom modifier to Perception
      checks made to find valuable objects, and on opposed checks made against
      the Persuasion check of another creature.</p><h2>Silence</h2><p>In
      exchange for speaking only to cast spells, you are able to compel other
      creatures to action with only a glance. When a creature within 10 feet of
      you makes a Persuasion check, you may add your Wisdom modifier to the
      result.</p>
