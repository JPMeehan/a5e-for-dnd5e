      <p>As a bonus action, you can declare a last stand, which lasts for 10
      minutes. While your Last Stand is active, for each allied creature within
      the range of your Commanding Presence ability that is at 0 hp, you and any
      friendly creatures within the same area gain a +1 bonus to damage with
      weapon attacks. These bonuses stack, but the maximum bonus you can receive
      is equal to your proficiency bonus. If one of the creatures is revived,
      the bonus to damage decreases, but you and allied creatures in the area
      gain temporary hp equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you have used this
      ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
