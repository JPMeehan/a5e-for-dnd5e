      <p>You can use an action and touch a plant to be recognized by nature as
      one of its protectors for the next hour. For the duration, you gain
      advantage on Persuasion checks made to influence druids and beasts.
      Alternatively, you can end the blessing early to gain advantage on a
      Survival check made to find Supply or a Haven in the wilderness.</p>
