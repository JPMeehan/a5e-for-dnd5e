      <p>At 2nd level you may use your Channel Divinity to mark a creature you
      can see within 30 feet for death. This mark lasts for 1 minute. The marked
      creature cannot regain hit points and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. At
      the start of each of their turns they must make a Constitution saving
      throw or take 2d4 necrotic damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at level 8
      and 2d8 at level 17. If a creature dies while so marked, you may choose to
      have the mark jump to a new creature if your choice you can see within 30
      feet of the creature that died. If you do so, increase the remaining
      duration by a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier to a maximum
      of 1 minute. A greater restoration, heal, mass heal, or similar magic ends
      the effect on a creature.</p>
