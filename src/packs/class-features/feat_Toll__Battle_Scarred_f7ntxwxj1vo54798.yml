      <p>Youâ€™ve embraced every victory and loss, and you wear each battle scar
      like a badge of honor. Whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points you gain a
      new permanent scar or mark, and you gain inspiration. Once you gain
      inspiration in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
