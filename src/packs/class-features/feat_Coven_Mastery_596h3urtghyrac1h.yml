      <p>At 10th level you gain the Coven Casting ritual mastery option, or a
      different ritual mastery option if you already have it. &nbsp;Furthermore,
      by linking with two other creatures using this ability over a short rest
      each of the three creatures can regain a spell slot of 5th level or lower.
      &nbsp;Furthermore, any one of the linked creatures can expend a spell slot
      in order to allow a different linked creature to regain a spell slot of
      the same or lower level. &nbsp;Once you have used this benefit you cannot
      do so again until you finish a long rest. &nbsp;You must have exactly two
      allies with ritual casting that you can bond with for the full duration of
      the short rest to use this ability.</p>
