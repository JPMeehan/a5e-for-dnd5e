      <p>Your patron grants you a bag of fairy dust, which contains a number of
      uses equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use a bonus action to
      sprinkle this fairy dust on yourself or a creature within 15 feet. A
      creature benefiting from your fairy dust gains a fly speed of 30 feet
      (with the ability to hover) for 10 minutes.</p><p>A creature other than
      you attempting to use the fairy dust must succeed on an Arcana check equal
      to your spell save DC or it has no effect. When you finish a long rest,
      your previous bag of fairy dust disappears and you receive a new bag of
      fairy dust.</p>
