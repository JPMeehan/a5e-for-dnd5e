      <p>You are extremely good at breaking things—whether it’s the shop of a
      merchant who won’t cough up their protection money, the statue of a
      tyrant, or the fortifications of an occupying army. Objects and structures
      have vulnerability to your weapon attacks, provided you are using a weapon
      with an appropriate damage type (a hammer for bricks, a blade for rope,
      etc.). This bonus stacks with the breaker property on your weapons.</p>
