      comfortable in even the heaviest armors. You gain the following

      wearing a helm or visored helm.</p></li><li><p>You never suffer fatigue
      from wearing armor or sleeping in armor.</p></li><li><p>You can don or
      doff armor in half the time it would normally take.</p></li><li><p>You
      never have disadvantage on Acrobatics or Stealth checks due to wearing
      armor or using a heavy shield.</p></li></ul>
