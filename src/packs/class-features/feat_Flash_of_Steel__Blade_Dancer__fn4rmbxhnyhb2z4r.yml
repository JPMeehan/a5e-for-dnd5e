      <p>You bring your weapons to bear faster than the eye can blink. You can
      draw your Fencer’s Arsenal weapons at any time, even when you are
      surprised and even when it is not your turn. Drawing your Fencer’s Arsenal
      weapons requires no action, and it does not need to be done as part of
      another action.</p>
