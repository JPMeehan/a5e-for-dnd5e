      <p>Also at 2nd level you are capable of taking on more strenuous forms
      than druids of other circles and find the change much easier. You may
      select wild shapes with a CR of 1 at 2nd level, and wild shapes with a CR
      no higher than 1/3 your druid level at later levels. In addition, you can
      use a bonus action to assume a wild shape.</p>
