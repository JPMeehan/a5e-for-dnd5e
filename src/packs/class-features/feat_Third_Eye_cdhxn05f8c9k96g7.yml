      <p>At 15th level you open your third eye. You gain 60 feet of darkvision
      if you do not already have it. If you already have darkvision, the rand of
      your darkvision increases by 30 feet. You can see through magical darkness
      with this darkvision. In addition, you may choose one the following
      spells: <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">detect magic, detect evil
      and good, detect poison and disease, </em>or<em
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> see invisibility</em>. You gain the
      benefits of this spell, no spell slot or concentration required, unlimited
      duration, and the effect cannot be dispelled, though it can be suppressed
      by an antimagic field.</p>
