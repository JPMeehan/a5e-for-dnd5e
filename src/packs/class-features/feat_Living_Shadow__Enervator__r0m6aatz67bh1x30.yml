    value: >-
      <p>You are able to use your gifts to turn your shadow into a real friend.
      You no longer cast a shadow in light, as it is now a loyal companion,
      having performed a dark ritual, it has been turned into a Shade.</p>

      <p>While the shade is not your familiar, it acts the same as one as per
      the spell.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, any features that affect your familiar through the
      <em>Pact of the Chain</em> also affect your Shade.</p>
