      <p>Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you can empower
      a melee weapon you touch while raging. For the duration of your rage, as
      long as you are holding it the weapon deals an extra [[/r 1d6 #lightning]]
      lightning damage. <br>The damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at
      15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level. Only one weapon can be empowered at a
      time, though you can use a bonus action to transfer the effect to a
      different weapon.</p><p>In addition, you gain resistance to lightning
      damage. </p>
