      <p dir="ltr">When you move on your turn, you can choose to freeze the air
      ahead of you, creating a path of ice like a wall. The ice path can go up
      or down at a maximum angle of 45 degrees; moving upwards costs double your
      movement, and you get a bonus to your speed downwards equal to the
      downward angle of the slope. Each 10 ft section of the path has AC 12 and
      30 hit points, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. If a section of the
      path is destroyed, the path collapses. Ice created with this adaptation
      melts after 1 minute, unless the air temperature is below freezing.</p>
