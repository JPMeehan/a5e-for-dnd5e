      powerful.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Light of Truth</h3><p dir="ltr">If you choose
      Path of the Light, you now emit bright light to a range of 30 feet and dim
      light to a range of 60 feet. You may suppress this light at will (no
      action required) and reactivate it as a bonus action. While this light is
      active, you have advantage on Insight checks against creatures within the
      area of bright light. In addition, creatures observing illusions within
      the area of the bright light have advantage on saves to disbelieve
      them.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Gloom of Deceit</h3><p dir="ltr">If you choose Path
      of the Dark, you now suppress light by one level within a range of 30
      feet. (Bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness, and
      darkness becomes magical darkness). You may suppress this darkness (no
      action required) or reactivate it as a bonus action. While this darkness
      is active, illusions within its area become more potent. Creatures
      witnessing an illusion in the area have disadvantage on saves to
      disbelieve them, and creatures failing such a save become rattled.
      Creatures attempting an Insight check on you also do so with
      disadvantage.</p>
