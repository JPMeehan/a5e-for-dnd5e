      <p>At 3rd level, your defensive abilities also improve with some help from
      your magical studies.</p><p>If you have the Brutal Defense feature, you
      can spend 2 exertion points to infuse your armor with crackling magical
      energy for a minute. While this ability is active, a creature that hits
      you with a melee attack must make a Constitution saving throw against your
      spell save DC. A creature that fails the save takes force damage equal to
      your martial arts die.</p><p>If you have the Agile Defense ability, you
      instead may instead use Flurry of Blows, Long Step, or Patient Defense
      after casting a spell with a casting time of one action.</p>
