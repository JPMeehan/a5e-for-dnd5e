      <p>At 1st level you learn to use your patron&rsquo;s power as a weapon,
      blasting enemies with an eldritch force that defies even the laws of
      magic. Choose one of the following features:&nbsp;</p><h2>Eldritch
      Disturbance</h2><p>You can use an action to strike a creature you can see
      within 60 feet with a reality-distorting curse, blending pain both mental
      and physical. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 1d10 force
      damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.</p><h2>Eldritch
      Ray</h2><p>You can use an action to create a deadly beam that strikes a
      creature within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature,
      dealing 1d10 force damage on a hit.</p><h2>Eldritch Scythe</h2><p>Once per
      turn when you would make a melee weapon attack as part of the Attack
      action or an opportunity attack, you can instead make a melee spell
      attack, lashing out with an ephemeral and unearthly blade. On hit, the
      target takes 1d8 force damage. In addition, you can choose a creature that
      you can see and that is within your reach. It takes half as much
      damage.</p><h2>Eldritch Whip</h2><p>You can use an action to thrash a
      creature with a scintillating tendril of arcane force. Make a melee spell
      attack against a creature within 15 feet, dealing 1d6 force damage on a
      hit. At the end of your turn you gain a number of temporary hit points
      equal to half the damage you dealt with Eldritch Whip this turn (minimum
      1), which last until the end of your next turn. When you hit a creature
      with your Eldritch Whip and you already have temporary hit points, you can
      end the temporary hit points early to gain a bonus to the Eldritch
      Whip&rsquo;s damage roll equal to half the number of temporary hit points
      you ended early.</p>
