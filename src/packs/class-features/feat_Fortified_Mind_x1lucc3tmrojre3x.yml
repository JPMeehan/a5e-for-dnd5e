      <p>Your mind becomes hardened to the influence of extraplanar
      forces.&nbsp;You have resistance to <em>psychic</em> damage and have
      advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws imposed by
      aberrations, celestials, fey, fends, and undead.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, you never suffer any sort of ill effect merely from
      knowing or discovering something related to otherworldly threats or lore
      (The Narrator has the final say here, but is encouraged to be
      generous).</p>
