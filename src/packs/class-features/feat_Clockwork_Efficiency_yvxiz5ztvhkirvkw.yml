      <p>You gain the ability to create singular moments of explosive
      coordination. As an action, select up to 6 friendly creatures (which may
      include you) within 100 feet. All of the creatures immediately take a
      single action, expending their reaction to do so. If the order of their
      actions matter, you may decide the sequence. Once you use this feature,
      you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p>
