    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings
      from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your Speed. You can create
      or dismiss these wings as a bonus action. You can’t manifest these wings
      while wearing armor unless the armor is made&nbsp;to accommodate them
      (increasing the armor’s cost by 50%), and clothing not made to accommodate
      your wings may be destroyed when you manifest them.</p>
