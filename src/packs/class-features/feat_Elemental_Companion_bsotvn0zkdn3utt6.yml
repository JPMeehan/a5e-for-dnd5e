      dir="ltr">At 3rd level, you learn how to focus some of your power tightly
      until it manifests as an elemental creature. It is friendly to you and
      your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in
      the Elemental Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB)
      in several places. You determine the creature&rsquo;s exact appearance,
      which has no effect on its game statistics, but the creature is made of
      pure elemental material: windy clouds for air, flames for fire, soil and
      rock for earth, and roiling water for water. Your elemental
      companion&rsquo;s element is determined by your elemental affinity. This
      determines a number of its abilities and features. If you possess multiple
      elemental affinities, you choose one of them when your elemental companion
      manifests; you may switch if you summon a new one.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In combat, your elemental companion shares your initiative
      count. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it
      takes on its turn is the Dash, Dodge, or Sprint action, unless you take a
      bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That
      action can be one in its stat block or some other action, not just those
      listed (such as basic combat maneuvers like Push or Grapple).</p>

      <p dir="ltr">When you cast a spell or use elemental blast, you can have
      your elemental companion be that spell&rsquo;s origin, as long as you can
      see your elemental companion and it is within 60 feet. Additionally, as an
      action, you can spend spell points to heal your elemental companion if you
      can see it and it is within 60 feet of you; it regains a number of hit
      points equal to 1d8 per spell point you spend, up to your spell point
      casting limit. Your elemental companion has its own Hit Dice, which it can
      use to heal during short rests. If your elemental companion has died, you
      can revive it by focusing your power during a short or a long rest. Rather
      than reviving a companion, you can alternatively summon a new one.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Your elemental companion also dies if you die. When it dies,
      it crumbles and evaporates, fading into nothing and leaving behind any
      items it was wielding, wearing, or carrying. If you are unconscious, your
      elemental companion acts on its own to defend you, using its full range of
      actions, remaining by your side.</p>
