      <p>You may not always stand and fight, but woe betide the fool who thinks
      you a coward. You gain advantage on saving throws to avoid being charmed,
      compelled, or frightened; to resist the effects of poisons and diseases;
      and to avoid gaining levels of fatigue or strife. You also gain advantage
      on saving throws and opposed checks to resist interrogation and to resist
      having your thoughts read.</p>
