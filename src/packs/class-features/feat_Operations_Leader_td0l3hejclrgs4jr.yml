      <p>Starting at 11th level, you devise a set of communication cues. Any
      allies who have received this training— usually taking 10 minutes of
      discussion and practice — do not need to share a language with you to
      benefit from this feature.</p><p>Additionally on your turn, you can use a
      bonus action and spend 5 exertion points to make it easier for you and
      your allies to help each other with certain skills. While this
      coordination is in place, your chosen allies can take the Help action as a
      bonus action to help each other. This coordination requires you to
      maintain concentration, and both chosen allies—the one with the skill
      proficiency and the one making the ability check—to be within 30 feet of
      you at the time of the ability check.</p><p>You can use your bonus action
      to change which allies benefit from the coordination each turn and you are
      able to concentrate on it for up to 10 minutes. The skills that can
      benefit from this are Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Deception,
      Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Stealth, and Survival. This might be
      used to help the team navigate difficult terrain, maintain a facade while
      undercover, or perform an ambush.</p><p>If you have proficiency in Stealth
      this coordination can happen silently via surreptitious signals. If you
      have proficiency in Deception this coordination can happen as a series of
      code words interspersed with other conversation. An onlooker needs to
      succeed on an Insight check contested by your ability check— whether
      Stealth or Deception — to realize the coordination is taking place.
