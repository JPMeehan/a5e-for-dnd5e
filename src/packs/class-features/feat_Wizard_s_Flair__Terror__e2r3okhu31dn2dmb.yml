      <p>At 9th level, you have created a flair that you use when casting
      spells. Choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a long
      rest, you may replace your flair with another.</p><p>Whenever you cast a
      spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose to cast it with your flair.
      You can do so again when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><h3><strong>Terror</strong></h3><p>Choose one creature within 30
      feet that can see you when you cast the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom
      saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn.
      While frightened in this way, it starts its turn by using its full
      movement to get away from you in the most direct manner possible, avoiding
      obvious hazards along the way.</p>
