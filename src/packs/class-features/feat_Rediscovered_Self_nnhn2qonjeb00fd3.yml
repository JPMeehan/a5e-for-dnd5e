      <p>At 10th level you discover an animal form that resonates with you. When
      you first gain this feature select a wild shape you know. Once per day,
      you may assume your chosen wild shape without expending a use of your wild
      shape feature. You may remain in your chosen wild shape indefinitely. You
      may also rest in your chosen wild shape and do not revert out of it when
      unconscious.</p>
