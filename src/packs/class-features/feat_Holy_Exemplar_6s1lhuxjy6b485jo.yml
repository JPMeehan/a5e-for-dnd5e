      <p>At 20th level, your deity constantly watches over you. Even death
      cannot touch you as you recover from mortal wounds in a flash of holy
      light, a sudden swelling of unnatural darkness, or another expression of
      potent divine power. When you die after being reduced to 0 hit points by
      an attack or spell, after 1d4 rounds you return to life with 100 hit
      points. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
