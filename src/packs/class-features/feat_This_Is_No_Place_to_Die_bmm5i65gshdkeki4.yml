      <p>At 17th level, your presence is enough to help allies cling to life a
      little longer, confident that you have a plan to save them. If one of your
      allies that you’re aware died in the past round, you can use your action
      to entreat them to hold on. If you do, they briefly return to life at 0
      hit points, are stable, and for the next minute cannot be required to make
      death saving throws from taking damage. If they remain at 0 hit points at
      the end of one minute, they actually die.</p><p>At the Narrator’s
      discretion, some actions can kill a helpless creature despite this
      ability, such as decapitation or falling in lava.</p><p>Once you use this
      feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
      again.</p>
