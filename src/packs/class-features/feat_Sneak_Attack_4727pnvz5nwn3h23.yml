      <p>Beginning at 1st level, you fight with precision, taking advantage of
      momentary lapses in an opponentâ€™s concentration. Once per turn, you can
      deal extra weapon damage when you hit a creature with a finesse weapon or
      ranged weapon attack. The amount of extra damage is shown in the Sneak
      Attack column of the Rogue table. </p><p>In order to apply this damage,
      you must not have disadvantage on the attack and your target must be
      within 5 feet of another enemy of the target who is not incapacitated.
      Alternatively, you can apply sneak attack damage if you have advantage on
      the attack.</p>
