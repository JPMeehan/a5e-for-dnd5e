      <p>Your reputation for benevolent care and sharing useful knowledge
      precedes you. You can automatically find food and shelter for yourself in
      a significant settlement equivalent to a moderate lifestyle. In addition,
      when you finish a short or long rest, you gain the benefits of a special
      version of the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.uell7a5o6fcerke2]{Sanctuary} spell
      that only applies to humanoids, and most humanoids are willing to at least
      talk to you before attacking. This effect ends based on the normal
      conditions for <em>sanctuary</em>.</p>
