      <p>This armed alchemical grenade explodes when it hits a target or at the
      end of your turn.</p><p>Whenever you hit a target with an alchemical
      grenade, each creature within 5 feet of the target makes a Dexterity
      saving throw or takes half as much damage as taken by the target (the
      target is immune to this effect). Whenever you miss with an armed
      alchemical grenade it explodes in a harmless location at the end of your
      turn.</p><h3><strong>Flashbang</strong></h3><p>A target hit by this
      grenade makes a Constitution saving throw or is blinded until<br>the end
      of its next turn. </p>
