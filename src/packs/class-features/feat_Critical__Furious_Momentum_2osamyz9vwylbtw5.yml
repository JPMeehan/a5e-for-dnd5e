    value: >-
      <p>Seizing on the fervor of a well-struck blow, you use your fury to fight
      all the harder. When you score a critical hit, the next melee weapon
      attack you make before the end of your next turn is a&nbsp;critical hit on
      a roll of 17â€“20. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again
      until you have finished a short rest. Alternatively, you can expend one
      use of Rage to use this feature. The effects of this Furious Critical can
      be combined with any other.</p>
