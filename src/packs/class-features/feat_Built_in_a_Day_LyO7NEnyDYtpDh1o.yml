      <p>You gain proficiency with
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.zn52h9g28j8i3v0j]{Carpenter's
      Tools}, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. With the
      appropriate tools and access to raw materials, you can quickly construct
      simple wooden structures, such as a log bridge, barricade, or perch. A
      medium structure takes you 10 minutes to build, a large structure takes 1
      hour, and a huge structure takes 8 hours. These structures are crude and
      improvised, and fall into disrepair and become unusable after 24 hours
      unless you spend an equal amount of time again to maintain them each
      day.</p>
