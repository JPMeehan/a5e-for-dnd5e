    value: >-
      <p>While you are conscious, any ally that starts its turn within range of
      your Commanding Presence can use an action to move up to twice its Speed
      in a straight line and take the Attack action. Until the end of that
      allyâ€™s next turn, creatures they did not attack on their turn have
      advantage on attack rolls against them.</p>
