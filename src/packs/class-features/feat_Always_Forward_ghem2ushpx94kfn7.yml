      dir="ltr">Also at 3rd level, you are equipped to overcome any natural
      obstacle. You gain an expertise die when making saving throws to resist
      fatigue following a forced march. In addition, choose one of the following
      options:</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>World-Wanderer</strong></p>

      <p dir="ltr">You gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your
      speed, or increase these speeds by 10 feet if you already have them. In
      addition, your speed is only reduced by 5 feet instead of halved when
      crawling, squeezing, or traversing difficult terrain.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Specialized Explorer</strong></p>

      <p dir="ltr">You gain an additional secret of nature from the druid class,
      and it does not count against your total exploration knacks known.</p>
