      <p>At 17th level, you can use an action and spend 8 exertion to make a
      melee weapon attack against a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom
      modifier within 30 feet of you, making a separate attack roll for each
      target. For each subsequent hit after the first, you deal an additional
      1d6 damage. This still counts as a single Attack action for the purpose of
      Flurry of Blows or similar abilities.</p>
