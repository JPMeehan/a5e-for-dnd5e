      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to bend your magic in flexible,
      constantly-changing ways. When you finish a short or long rest, you can
      choose a benefit from the following list. You can expend your Flux to use
      that benefit.</p>

      <p>When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can change your
      benefit to a different one, recharging your Flux. Otherwise your Flux
      recharges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Ad Hoc Defense. </strong></em>When you take damage, you can
      use your reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to your
      proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Elusive. </strong></em>You can use a bonus action to
      teleport 15 feet to a space you can see.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Reactive Ward.</strong></em> When you make a saving throw,
      you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the result.
      You may do so after the roll is made, but before any effects of it are
      resolved.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Spell Intensity. </strong></em>When you deal damage with a
      spell, you can increase the first damage roll of that spell by an amount
      equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>
