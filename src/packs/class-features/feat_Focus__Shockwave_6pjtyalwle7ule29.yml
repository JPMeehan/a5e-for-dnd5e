    value: >-
      <p><em>Requirement: 5th level</em></p><p>You can use an action and spend 3
      exertion to hit the ground so hard it sends a shockwave in a 40-foot line
      that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
