      <p dir="ltr">You cause a creature, for one round, to be able to take any
      number of reactions. The creature takes 2 damage when it takes its second
      reaction, which is doubled when it takes its third, doubled again for its
      fourth, and so on. When the creature has an opportunity to take a
      reaction, it is magically forced to, even if doing so would reduce it to 0
      hit points.</p>
