      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">At 11th level you
      have learned how to magically enhance your interactions with others, as
      well as leveraging your natural interpersonal skills to enhance your
      magic. Choose one of the following:</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:
      .0001pt;"><s><strong>Fascinating Allure</strong></s></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Unnerving
      Intimidation</strong></s></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Bewildering
      Deception</strong></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You gain an expertise
      die on Deception checks and may always apply your spellcasting ability
      modifier to Deception checks. In addition, any time you cast an illusion
      spell that can be seen through with an Investigation check, you may make a
      Deception check and use either your spell save DC or the result of the
      check as the DC to see through the illusion.</p>
