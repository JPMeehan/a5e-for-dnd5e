      <p>At 20th level, you no longer question the motives of those around you
      as your refined instincts easily sniff out dishonesty. When listening to a
      creature speak, provided you share at least one language, you are
      immediately aware if it is being dishonest though you have no special
      ability to obtain the truth without using your Channel Divinity. Creatures
      protected from divination, such as by the <em>nondetection</em> spell, are
      immune to this feature.</p>
