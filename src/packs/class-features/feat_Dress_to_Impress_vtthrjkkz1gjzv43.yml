      dir="ltr">At 9th level, your facility with disguises and alter egos has
      become truly prodigious. You immediately gain the Costumer, Master of
      Disguise, and Dress Rehearsal options from the Low Profile, Guarded
      Aspect, and Overpowering Personality features of the rogue class
      respectively. You still gain these features as normal when you reach the
      appropriate levels in the rogue class, but may not choose the options you
      already gained from this feature at those levels.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you gain proficiency in Charisma saving
      throws.</p>
