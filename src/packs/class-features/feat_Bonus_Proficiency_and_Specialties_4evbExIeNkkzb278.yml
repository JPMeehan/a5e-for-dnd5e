      <p>When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
      Culture and Performance. If you are already proficient with either skill,
      you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain additional
      specialties equal to your proficiency bonus, and you gain another
      specialty whenever your proficiency bonus increases. These bonus
      specialties must be in Culture or Performance.</p>
