      <p>At 2nd level you can magically summon a spiritual vine that can strike
      and grab your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot long vine at a
      point you can see within 60 feet. The vine lasts for 1 minute, until you
      dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you use this feature to create
      another vine. When you create the vine, you can make a melee spell attack
      against one target within 10 feet of it. On a hit the target takes 1d6
      force damage, and it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell
      save DC. On a failure the target is restrained by the vine (escape DC
      equal to your spell save DC).&nbsp;When you reach 10th level in this
      class, the damage increases to 2d6.</p>

      <p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the vine up to 30 feet and
      repeat the attack, or if a creature is currently restrained by the vine
      you may move the vine and the restrained creature 10 feet in any
      direction.</p>
