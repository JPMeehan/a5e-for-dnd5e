      <p>At 10th level, your fury magically suppresses the regenerative
      abilities of your foes. While you are raging, a creature with a
      regeneration ability that starts its turn within 10 feet of you regains
      only half as many hit points as normal (rounded down).</p><p>You also gain
      the supernatural ability to devour life force from downed foes. When you
      reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you recover one
      expended hit die. For you to do so, the creature&rsquo;s CR must be at
      least half your character level (rounded down).</p>
