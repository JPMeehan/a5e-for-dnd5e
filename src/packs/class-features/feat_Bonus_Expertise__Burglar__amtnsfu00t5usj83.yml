      <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Sleight of Hand, and you
      gain an expertise die on checks using it and when using thieves’ tools.
      For you, expertise dice in Sleight of Hand and thieves’ tools can be
      upgraded from d8 to d10, exceeding the usual limit on expertise dice. You
      can use your Cunning Action to make a Sleight of Hand check or to use
      thieves’ tools.</p>
