    value: >-
      <p>While you are conscious and when an ally within range of your
      Commanding Presence would drop to 0 or fewer hit points, your ally can use
      their reaction to spend the tactics die and roll it to gain temporary hit
      points equal to the result plus your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Once a
      creature has benefited from the tactics die in this way, it cannot do so
      again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
