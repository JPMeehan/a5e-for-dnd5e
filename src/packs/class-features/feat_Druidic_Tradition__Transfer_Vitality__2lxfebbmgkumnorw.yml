      <p>At 6th level you master a technique passed down through countless
      generations of druids. Choose one of the
      following:</p><h3><strong>Transfer Vitality</strong></h3><p>You’ve learned
      to conduct natural vitality into a healing force. You may expend a use of
      Wild Shape to cast cure wounds at a spell level equal to 1/3 your druid
      level. </p><p>In addition, when you restore a creature’s hit points, you
      may choose to restore twice as many hit points as normal. Once you restore
      hit points in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
