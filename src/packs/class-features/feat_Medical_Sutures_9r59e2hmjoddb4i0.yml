      <p>Starting at 5th level you’ve turned your arcanoscience expertise
      towards first aid. You can create the following additional items using
      Tactical
      Chemistry:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.989ahbuhi1cqvrmy]{Bandage}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.067o6hjosd8nrjs8]{Healer's
      Satchel} (1 use)</p></li></ul><p>In addition, you can reattach a severed
      limb or body part. The limb or body part must be relatively intact and the
      injury must be no more than 8 hours old. The reattaching process takes 1
      hour and requires a DC 14 leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit check. On a
      success the limb or body part is attached and functional with no further
      complications. On a failure the limb cannot be saved.</p><p>Alternatively,
      you can replace a lost limb or body part with a donor part. This donor
      part must be analogous to a missing part (an arm for an arm, a leg for a
      leg), and it must be from a humanoid creature of the same size. The
      reattaching process requires a DC 20 leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit
      check when performed in this way.</p>
