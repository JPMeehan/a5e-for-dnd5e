      <p>All green knights hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Defend Nature.</strong> Protect and heal the lands you travel
      through.</li>

      <li><strong>Embody Strength.</strong> Be as mighty as a boulder and when
      needed stand firm like a rooted tree.</li>

      <li><strong>Ensure the Cycle. </strong>Do not suffer that which defies the
      natural flow of life and teach these ways to others.</li>

      <li><strong>Walk the World.</strong> Travel far and experience the beauty
      of nature beyond your territory.</li>

      </ul>
