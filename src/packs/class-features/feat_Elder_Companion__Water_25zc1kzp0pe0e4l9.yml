      dir="ltr">As you grow in power, so does your elemental companion.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 11th level, your elemental companion grows to large size,
      though you can reduce it to medium or small or back again to large as an
      action. It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to
      d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are
      able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its
      Elder ability, shown below.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Water, Whelm:</strong> Your elemental companion
      targets each Large or smaller creature in its space. Each target makes a
      Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the
      targets take your water blast damage and are grappled (escape DC equal to
      your spell save DC); a creature can attempt to escape with an Athletics
      check instead of a Strength or Dexterity saving throw if it chooses,
      swimming free. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and
      unable to breathe air. The elemental can move at full speed while carrying
      grappled creatures inside its space. It can grapple one Large creature or
      up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>
