      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers.
      You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Biting Zephyr</li>

      <li>Mist and Shade</li>

      <li>Rapid Current</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are
      proficient with.</p>

      <p>You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus,
      regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use
      your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool.</p>

      <p>The Maneuvers Known column of the Rogue table shows when you learn more
      maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver
      Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a
      given level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
      the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
      degree from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>
