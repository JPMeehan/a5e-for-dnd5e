      <p>Your expertise die on Stealth checks increases to d10. You have a
      passive Stealth score of 10 plus your Dexterity modifier plus your
      proficiency bonus. When you have not attempted to hide from a creature but
      are not visible to it and not making noise, you are considered hidden,
      using your passive Stealth score.</p>
