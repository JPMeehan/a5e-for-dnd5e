    value: >-
      <p>Your smite causes the target to shed bright light for 5 feet, and dim
      light for an additional 5 feet. The effect lasts for up to 1 minute, or
      until you target another creature with a weapon attack. As long as the
      effect lasts, the target gains no benefit from invisibility and has
      disadvantage on checks made to hide.</p>
