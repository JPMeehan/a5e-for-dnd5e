      <p>Also at level 3, once you have spent 24 hours in a new city, you can
      choose to acquire a grade 1 frugal Safehouse stronghold for free. You may
      only have one of these strongholds in any given city, but if one is
      discovered by your enemies, you can replace it after another 24 hours. You
      may have a maximum number of safehouses acquired by this feature equal to
      your proficiency bonus (each in a different community). If desired, you
      can decommission a safehouse over the course of 1 hour (clearing out
      possessions and removing clues) to set one up in a new location.</p>
