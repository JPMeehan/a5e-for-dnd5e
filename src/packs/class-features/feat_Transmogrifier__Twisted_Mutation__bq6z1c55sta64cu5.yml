      <p>At 6th level your power grows as your altered physiology adapts to the
      life you&rsquo;ve led up to this point. You may choose one of the
      following abilities and are not bound by your flesh and bone
      selection.</p>

      <p><strong>Transmogrifier</strong>: Once per short rest you may use your
      action to transform yourself into a tiny or smaller creature, or an
      animated object up to medium size as per the spell&rsquo;s functions
      though you retain your mental attributes and can still perform S
      components for spellcasting purposes you cannot vocalize. You gain a
      number of temporary HP equal to the animated object&rsquo;s HP. Once your
      temporary HP run out you revert to your normal form, though you can choose
      to end this effect at any time, otherwise it has no duration. Any objects
      you carry become a part of your new form and do not function.</p>

      <p>In addition, if you possess the shapeshifter bonded power you may use
      it a number of times per short rest equal to your proficiency bonus, but
      may still recover a use by expending a sorcery point as a bonus
      action.</p>
