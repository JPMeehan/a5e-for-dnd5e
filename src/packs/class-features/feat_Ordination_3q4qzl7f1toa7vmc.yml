      <p>Your mission in the world is supported by the spiritual community or
      religious hierarchy who called you to religious service. As a formal
      leader within your religious order, you are expected to perform the
      ceremonies of your faith, including weddings and funerals. In exchange,
      members of your faith provide you and your companions with food, lodging,
      and a modest lifestyle.</p><p>Additionally, if your congregation or order
      is able, they send you letters with regular updates about their
      well-being. They are willing to help connect you with other chapters of
      your faith through letters of introduction.</p>
