      <p>Also at 1st level, whenever you finish a long rest in a town, village,
      enclave, commune, or other reasonably major population center, the
      Narrator should give you a new piece of information about something
      significant going on in the world. Your sources of information are varied
      and mysterious, and it is enough to know that you know. Once you have done
      so, you cannot gain information again from the same location until you
      have gained information from a different location with this feature.</p>
