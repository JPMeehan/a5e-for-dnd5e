      <p>When you select this archetype at 1st level, you develop an enhanced
      connection to the world of spirits. You gain proficiency with the Religion
      skill or an expertise die if you are already proficient and a skill
      specialty in it for undead. You also learn your choice of one of the
      <em>mage hand, chill touch, or spare the dying</em> cantrips, which does
      not count against your maximum cantrips known. In addition, choose one of
      the following options:</p><h3>Chilling Curse</h3><p>You can use a bonus
      action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The
      curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or
      you become incapacitated. The curse has the following
      effects:</p><ul><li><p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature,
      it takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at
      10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p></li><li><p>You gain a
      pool of spectral dice, which begins empty. Each spectral die represents a
      sliver of spiritual power. When the cursed creature acquires a condition
      or a tracked condition it already has ticks up, add one spectral die to
      this pool. You can spend a spectral die when making an ability check tied
      to your spellcasting ability to gain a 1d4 bonus. For example, if you
      selected Wisdom for your spellcasting ability, you could use a spectral
      die to give yourself a bonus to a Wisdom (Perception) check. The pool
      disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</p></li></ul><h3>Defy the
      Departed</h3><p>You gain a supernatural resistance to the depredations of
      undead creatures. You make all saving throws against effects from undead
      creatures with advantage.</p>
