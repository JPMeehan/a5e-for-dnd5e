      <p>You gain proficiency with checks using a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.uwrm02lk6beqqt92]{Forgery Kit}.
      If you are already proficient with checks using a forgery kit, you instead
      gain an expertise die. In addition, your prestige increases by 1 as you
      claim other great artists&rsquo; work as your own while maintaining
      plausible deniability with the general public. Of course, you may draw the
      ire from the artists you steal from or those who closely follow their
      work.</p>
