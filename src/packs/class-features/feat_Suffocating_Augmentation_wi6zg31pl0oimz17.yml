      spending 7 spell points, your blast sucks the air from the target&rsquo;s
      lungs or fills them with water. Creatures hit must succeed a Constitution
      saving throw or take 1d6 ongoing damage and begin holding their breath;
      they can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns to
      regain their breath and end the effect. Non-breathing creatures are immune
      to this effect. This otherwise follows the rules for drowning and
      suffocation.</span></p>
