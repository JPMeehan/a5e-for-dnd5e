      <p dir="ltr">Like ebbing water, you are able to quickly adapt your lies
      and deceptions during the flow of conversation. You gain proficiency in
      Deception. If you are already proficient, you instead gain an expertise
      die. Additionally, if you fail a Deception check made to tell a lie to a
      creature, you can instantly reroll, but you must take the second result
      even if it is worse, as you notice they aren&rsquo;t falling for your lies
      and quickly adapt. Once you use this ability on a creature, you cannot use
      it again on the same creature until you complete a long rest.</p>
