      <p dir="ltr">At 6th level, you have an uncanny knack for learning who has
      access to the levers of power in a community. By spending an hour asking
      around, you can automatically find who has authority over a particular
      aspect of a community&rsquo;s life such as, but not limited to, who the
      local top law enforcer is, who is in charge of infrastructure, who
      controls the local budget, and so on. Once you have found such an
      individual, you gain an expertise die to Deception, Intimidation, or
      Persuasion checks to convince them to help you or your community.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Your prestige rating also increases by 2 and can never be lower
      than 3.</p>
