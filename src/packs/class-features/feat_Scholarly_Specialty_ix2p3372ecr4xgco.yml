      <p>When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, choose one classical
      school of magic as your Scholarly Specialty: abjuration, conjuration,
      divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or
      transmutation. The gold and time you must spend to copy spells from this
      school into your spellbook is halved. If a feature refers to your chosen
      school, it refers to the school selected in this feature.</p>
