      <p>Beginning at 15th level, you can make yourself impossible to ignore on
      the battlefield. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 exertion points to
      taunt all enemies within 30 feet. Affected creatures must make an
      Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures that fail
      their save zero in on you and you alone for one minute, causing them
      disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than you and on opposed
      checks they make to find hiding creatures other than you. A creature can
      repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
      success.&nbsp;</p>
