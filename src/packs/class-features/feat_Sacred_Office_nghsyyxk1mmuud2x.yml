      <p>Also at 4th level, your mission has taken root and is known through
      much of the land, conveying rumors both good and ill about your deeds.
      Choose one of the following.</p><h2>Auspicious Collaborator</h2><p>The
      higher powers you are attuned to have witnessed your deeds and bestowed
      upon you a quality of worthiness. Your requests for aid are perceived as
      opportunities for partnership rather than impositions.</p><p>People of all
      backgrounds are more drawn to help you than they would ordinarily be. You
      gain one specialty chosen from Culture or Persuasion, and you gain an
      expertise die on Persuasion checks related to seeking aid.</p><h2>Divine
      Authority</h2><p>Your connection to religious hierarchy opens many doors.
      Sermons you give and courtesy calls you make to different religious groups
      put you in contact with a local representative of your faith, who is happy
      to strongly recommend you to another local leader. You gain one specialty
      chosen from Culture, Insight, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain an
      expertise die on Culture, Insight, and Persuasion checks made against
      local leaders to whom you are recommended that would otherwise be
      indifferent towards you.</p><h2>Engaging Proclaimer</h2><p>Your
      recitations of divine stories, songs, or chants quickly build and hold an
      audience&rsquo;s attention, whether you are speaking to a packed tavern or
      a smaller gathering. You gain an expertise die on Performance checks to
      gather and hold the attention of 2 or more people. In addition, you gain
      two skill specialties, chosen from Performance and
      Religion.</p><h2>Reputation</h2><p>Your reputation for talented ministry
      and good works precedes you. Common folk frequently recognize you on
      sight, and those who do often have a friendly disposition towards you.
      They often ask you for counsel, favors, and blessings. The disposition of
      people they introduce you to are one stage better than normal (the
      indifferent become friendly, the hostile become
      indifferent).</p><h2>Symbol of Might</h2><p>The strength of the powers you
      serve is obvious to anybody you interact with, and you are able to use it
      to garner a certain level of fear and compliance. You gain one
      Intimidation specialty, and you gain an expertise die on Intimidation
      checks made to convince others to comply with your demands. The people you
      intimidate are no longer friendly towards you, if they were
      previously.</p>
