    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you distract
      that foe through a mix of repartee and positioning, causing them to move
      in the direction you want. If they fail a Wisdom saving throw against your
      trick DC, until the end of your turn when you move, you can move them an
      equal distance, keeping them within your melee reach the whole time. Their
      movement doesnâ€™t provoke opportunity attacks, and if you would move them
      into a space that would cause them damage, they can choose to stop outside
      it.</p><p>After you use this feature, you cannot use it against the same
      creature again until you finish a short rest.</p>
