      <p>When you are ambushed, you gain an expertise die on your initiative
      check. When you trigger a trap, you gain an expertise die on the first
      saving throw you need to make, or to your AC against the first attack the
      trap makes against you. After you use this ability, you cannot use it
      again until you complete a short rest .</p>
