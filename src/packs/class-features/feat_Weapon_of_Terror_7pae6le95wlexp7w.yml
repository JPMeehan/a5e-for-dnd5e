    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, your Weapon of Dread improves, allowing the weapon to
      absorb the essence of other magical weapons. As an hour-long ritual, you
      may transfer the properties of a magical weapon in your possession to your
      Weapon of Dread. Your Weapon of Dread gains the magical properties of that
      weapon, and the original becomes a mundane weapon of its type. </p><p>You
      may only absorb the essence of one magic weapon at a time with this
      feature. If you replace one set of properties with another, the once-magic
      item whose properties you had previously transferred immediately
      reacquires them (even if itâ€™s on another plane). If the disenchanted
      weapon has been destroyed, it magically re-forms in a space adjacent to
      you as your Weapon of Dread acquires its new properties.</p>
