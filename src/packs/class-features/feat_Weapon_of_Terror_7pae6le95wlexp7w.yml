      <p>At 7th level, your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.v1veq4yf1kt1boh3]{Weapon
      of Dread} improves, allowing the weapon to absorb the essence of other
      magical weapons. As an hour-long ritual, you may transfer the properties
      of a magical weapon in your possession to your Weapon of Dread. Your
      Weapon of Dread gains the magical properties of that weapon, and the
      original becomes a mundane weapon of its type.</p>

      <p>You may only absorb the essence of one magic weapon at a time with this
      feature. If you replace one set of properties with another, the once-magic
      item whose properties you had previously transferred immediately
      reacquires them (even if it&rsquo;s on another plane). If the disenchanted
      weapon has been destroyed, it magically re-forms in a space adjacent to
      you as your Weapon of Dread acquires its new properties.</p>
