      <p>Your connection to the divine enables you to separate the worthwhile
      from the worthless in an investigation or court case.&nbsp;</p><p>As a
      bonus action, you may ask a single question and expend a use of your
      Channel Divinity. For one hour, anything that would lead you to the answer
      to this question is highlighted with a divine glow only you can see.
      Witnesses or those with relevant knowledge seem to glow faintly, text that
      contains clues to the questionâ€™s answer appears highlighted on the page,
      and you automatically notice clues that would help you answer the question
      you asked.</p><p>This feature merely shows you the location of evidence;
      securing it and interpreting it are still up to you.</p><p></p>
