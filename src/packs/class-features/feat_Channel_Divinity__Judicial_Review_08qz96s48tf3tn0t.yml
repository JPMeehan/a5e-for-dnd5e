      <p>Your connection to the divine enables you to separate the worthwhile
      from the worthless in an investigation or court case.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>As a bonus action, you may ask a single question and expend a use of
      your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.s4iiatrup3e3virw]{Channel
      Divinity}. For one hour, anything that would lead you to the answer to
      this question is highlighted with a divine glow only you can see.
      Witnesses or those with relevant knowledge seem to glow faintly, text that
      contains clues to the question&rsquo;s answer appears highlighted on the
      page, and you automatically notice clues that would help you answer the
      question you asked.</p>

      <p>This feature merely shows you the location of evidence; securing it and
      interpreting it are still up to you.</p>
