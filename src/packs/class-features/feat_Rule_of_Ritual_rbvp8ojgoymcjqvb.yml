      <p>You make formal religious observances and perform ritual timekeeping.
      You can spend 1 hour during a long rest to make these observances, and if
      you do you only need 4 hours of sleep instead of the normal 6. You learn
      the @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ljixftygfhi0sfsf]{Guidance}
      cantrip if you do not already know it, and when you grant expertise dice
      with a spell of 1st-level or higher, the expertise die you grant increases
      by one step.</p>
