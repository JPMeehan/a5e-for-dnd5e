      <p>When you select this archetype at 3rd level your mental discipline
      allows you to psionically enhance your physical prowess. Any time an adept
      feature makes reference to your Wisdom modifier, you can instead use your
      Intelligence modifier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You
      can also use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength or
      Dexterity modifier when calculating your maneuver DC.</p><p>Lastly when
      you use the Flurry of Blows, Long Step, or Patient Defense abilities, you
      gain an additional benefit.</p><p><strong>Flurry of
      Blows.</strong></p><p>You deal additional psychic damage equal to your
      Intelligence modifier with your Flurry of Blows
      attacks.</p><p><strong>Long Step.</strong></p><p>You increase your total
      movement speed by an amount equal to 5 x your Intelligence modifier.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This bonus is added after all
      other modifications to your movement speed and is not multiplied by
      dashing, the haste spell, or other similar effects.</p><p><strong>Patient
      Defense.</strong></p><p>You can use your reaction when you would be hit by
      an attack to increase your AC against that attack by an amount equal to
      your Intelligence modifier.</p>
