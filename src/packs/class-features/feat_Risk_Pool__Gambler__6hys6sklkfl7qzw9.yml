      <p>As a Gambler you rely on luck even more than most adventurers.  You
      gain a pool of dice that represents the reservoir of your good
      fortune!</p><p>Once per round you may try to make a lucky strike on a
      target that you have advantage or expertise to hit.</p><p>This must be
      declared after the dice are rolled but before the narrator declares
      whether the attack was a hit or a miss.</p><ul><li><p>On a hit, add your
      risk dice to the damage dealt.</p></li><li><p>On a miss, your risk pool
      shrinks by 1 die until your next short rest.</p></li></ul><p>Your risk
      pool refills at the start of your next turn.</p>
