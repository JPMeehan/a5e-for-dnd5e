    value: >-
      <p>You can use an action to emit an aura of confession that extends 10
      feet from you, which benefits you and one other willing creature within
      the aura. The aura lasts for an hour or until you decide to dismiss it (no
      action required). The effect also ends early if you or the target fall
      unconscious, make an attack roll, cast a spell other than those of the
      healing school, or make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution
      check.</p><p>While the aura is active, any words uttered by you or the
      target are only audible to the two of you. Outside sound can enter the
      aura, but is muffled; you and the targeted creature have disadvantage on
      Perception checks that rely on hearing anything but each other while the
      field is active. Noise other than your conversation passes through the
      field normally and creatures outside the field can hear sounds on the far
      side of the area, as well as your footsteps, musical instruments, etc. at
      no penalty. Magical sensors and creatures besides you and the target
      inside the aura cannot hear the conversation but pick up other sounds
      normally.  If you end the effect by dismissing it, you may choose to
      impart one of the following effects onto the other creature: A calm
      emotions effect that persists for 8 hours and requires no
      concentration.</p><p>Heal up to 3 levels of strife from the creature.</p>
