      <p dir="ltr">Beginning at level 10, you gain tremendous power over
      nautical vessels traveling through your domain. Choose one of the
      following features:</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Maritime Terror</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">All of your attacks and spells gain the Breaker weapon
      property against water vehicles, and you gain advantage on checks to
      maintain a grapple while you are in water. Also while in contact with a
      body of water of at least Large size, you gain temporary hit points equal
      to your proficiency bonus at the beginning of each of your turns.</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Maritime Guardian</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">At your option, a water vehicle you ride gains resistance to
      bludgeoning, lightning, piercing, slashing, and thunder damage. You also
      gain advantage on Perception and Insight checks to detect threats to the
      vehicle or its occupants. Spells you cast that restore hit points can also
      target the vehicle to repair damage, even if the vehicle would not
      normally be a valid target for the spell.</p>
