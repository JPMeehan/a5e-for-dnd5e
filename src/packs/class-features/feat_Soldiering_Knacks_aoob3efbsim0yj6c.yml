      <p>Over the course of your training and adventures you have picked up a
      variety of skills and tricks to help you make your way. At 1st level you
      gain a soldiering knack of your choice. Your soldiering knacks are listed
      below. The Knacks Known column of the Fighter table shows when you learn
      more fighter soldiering knacks.</p>

      <h2>Amphibious Combatant</h2>

      <p>You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed, and you can spend 1 exertion
      to reroll a failed Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check related to
      aquatic activity (such as an Athletics check to swim, an Acrobatics check
      to keep balance on a ship&rsquo;s deck, or a Constitution check to hold
      your breath). You may choose whether to use the new roll or the original.
      In addition, you add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you
      can hold your breath before suffocating, and you can spend 1 exertion to
      hold your breath for additional minutes equal to your proficiency
      bonus.</p>

      <h2>Burst of Strength</h2>

      <p>You can spend 1 exertion to add your proficiency bonus to a Strength
      check, even if you already add your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>

      <h2>Campaigner</h2>

      <p>You double your Strength score when determining your carrying capacity
      and the weight you can lift, push, or drag. In addition, you can add your
      proficiency bonus to the number of hours you can march before you risk
      fatigue from a forced march.</p>

      <h2>Clearsight Sentinel</h2>

      <p>You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, you
      don&rsquo;t suffer disadvantage on Perception checks in lightly obscured
      areas (such as in light fog, moderate foliage, or heavy
      precipitation).</p>

      <h2>Extreme Leap</h2>

      <p>When you take the Dash action and mow at least 20 feet, your long jump
      distance is doubled until the end of your turn. You can spend 1 exertion
      to triple your jump distance until the end of your turn instead. If you
      do, you can move the full distance of your jump, even if it exceeds your
      Speed.</p>

      <h2>Mountaineer</h2>

      <p>You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed, and you can spend 1
      exertion to reroll a failed Athletics check to climb, choosing whether to
      use the new roll or the original. In addition, moving through nonmagical
      difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.</p>

      <h2>Nightwatch</h2>

      <p>When taking a long rest, add your proficiency bonus to the number of
      hours you can spend in light activity. In addition, one hour of that time
      can be spent in strenuous activity near the rest site (such as patrolling,
      fighting, or other adventuring activities) without interrupting your
      rest.</p>

      <h2>Stable Footing</h2>

      <p>You have advantage on checks and saving throws to avoid falling prone.
      You never fall prone after falling, and when calculating damage you take
      from falling, treat the fall distance as if it were shorter by a number of
      feet equal to 10 &times; your proficiency bonus.</p>

      <h2>Weather Beaten</h2>

      <p>You gain advantage on saving throws against cold and hot weather, as
      well as any adverse effects from wind or precipitation.</p>
