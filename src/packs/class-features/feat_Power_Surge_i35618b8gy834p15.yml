      <p>Your power flows directly through you, and you have the ability to push
      yourself and sacrifice your own safety by channeling more energy through
      you than your body can handle.</p>

      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you use your elemental blast as an action,
      you can choose to power surge to gain temporary spell points equal to half
      your proficiency bonus that must be used on an augmentation or
      augmentations on that elemental blast. When you choose to power surge, you
      take 1d8 damage per temporary spell point gained. This damage cannot be
      reduced in any way. These temporary spell points cannot be used to exceed
      your spell point casting limit.</p>
