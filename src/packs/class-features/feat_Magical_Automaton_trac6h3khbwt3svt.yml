      <p>At 20th level you’ve managed to achieve what most inventions are truly
      designed for, making machines that do your work for you. Whenever you
      create a spell invention, you may spend 25 additional gp in material
      components and expend two uses of your infusion feature to transform that
      spell invention into a spell automaton that uses the spell automaton stat
      block and it is destroyed if it reaches 0 hit points.</p><p>The exact
      design of your spell automaton is up to you, and it may resemble a
      humanoid creature, a boxy contraption, or be a magical construct flowing
      with arcane energies. </p><p>Your spell automaton is an ally to you and
      your companions. In combat, the it shares your initiative count, but it
      takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no
      action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action
      and uses its move to avoid danger.</p><p>You can maintain this spell
      automaton as if it was an infused item, requiring both the prepared spell
      invention and two uses of your infusion feature. You can repair your spell
      automaton to full hit points during a long rest solong as you have access
      to your tools of artifice. You can only maintain a single spell
      automatonat a time, and if you attempt to create a second spell automaton
      or fail to maintain one after finishing a long rest the spell automaton
      falls apart into scrap.</p>
