      <p>At 14th level if you spend a long rest doing nothing but resting and
      talking with or listening to another creature, that creature may remove an
      additional level of fatigue and strife, and may also remove such even if
      they have more than one level and are not in a haven. You cannot grant
      yourself this benefit.</p>
