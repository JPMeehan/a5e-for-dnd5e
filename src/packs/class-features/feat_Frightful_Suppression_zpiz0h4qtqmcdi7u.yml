      <p>When you make an attack that causes loud noises—a firearm or grenade,
      or also items and spells that deal thunder damage—you can use this trick
      to force the attack’s target (or creatures in the attack’s area) to make a
      Wisdom saving throw to gauge when it is safe to move, and thus avoid being
      pinned down. A creature that fails cannot move until the start of your
      next turn unless it spends an action.</p>
