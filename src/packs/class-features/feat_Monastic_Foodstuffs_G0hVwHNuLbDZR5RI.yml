      <p>You come from a religious order that creates some kind of foodstuff as
      part of monastic practice. Common variations on this theme are bread,
      cheese, beer, and wine, but it can be almost anything. You gain
      proficiency with brewer&rsquo;s supplies and cook&rsquo;s tools. In
      addition, your order has carefully created and maintained a small
      collection of secret recipes. Trade goods you produce with cook&rsquo;s
      tools or brewer&rsquo;s supplies have double their usual value. Finally,
      your culinary knowledge is refined enough that you can identify spices and
      other foodstuffs by appearance and smell and can tell cheap or fake
      imitations from the genuine article without the need for an ability
      check.</p>
