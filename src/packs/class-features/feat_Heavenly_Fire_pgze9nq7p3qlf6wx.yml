    value: >-
      <p>When you deal fire damage or radiant damage, at your option you can
      have that damage dealt be half fire damage and half radiant damage.<br>In
      addition, you may choose to have your fire spells heal rather than
      harming, restoring hit points equal to half the damage they would normally
      do. You may use this feature a number of times equal to half your
      proficiency bonus and regain all uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>
