      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers.
      You gain proficiency in two combat traditions:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Viper&rsquo;s Fang</li>

      </ul>

      <p>and your choice of either:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Mist and Shade</li>

      <li>Mirror&rsquo;s Glint</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You learn one maneuver of your choice from traditions you are
      proficient with.</p>

      <p>You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus,
      regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use
      your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool.</p>

      <p>The Maneuvers Known column of Table: Field Engineer Maneuvers shows
      when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with,
      while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select
      maneuvers from at a given level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
      the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
      level from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>
