      <blockquote><p>At 17th level, you become an implacable figure of
      judgment.</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>You are under a
      continuous <em>detect thoughts</em> effect with a range of 10 feet (it
      emits no magical aura).</p><p>You may teleport a distance of up to your
      walking speed as a bonus action once per round. </p><p>Additionally,
      creatures you kill have their souls immediately sent to their final
      judgment. This prevents speak with dead from working on their remains,
      prevents the remains from being reanimated as an Undead creature, and
      their remains acquire the doomed condition.</p><p>The soul of a creature
      slain by you cannot be captured on its way to judgment by any means short
      of an artifact or the wish spell.</p>
