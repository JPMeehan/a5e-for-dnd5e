      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to safely remove other humanoids from
      bad situations—conscious or not! As an action, you may lift another
      willing or unconscious Humanoid of your size category or smaller onto your
      shoulders. While you are carrying someone this way, you only have one hand
      free to use a weapon and you may move at your full movement speed, but may
      not Dash. The creature is considered grappled while you carry it this way,
      but has advantage on checks to free itself if it wants to.</p><p>You can
      climb while carrying someone this way, but your climbing speed is
      halved.</p><p>While swimming along the water’s surface, you can likewise
      hold another creature of your size category or smaller in such a way that
      its head remains above water and pull it along with you. While pulling a
      creature this way, your swim speed is halved. As above, such a creature is
      considered grappled, but has advantage on checks to free itself if it
      wants to do so.</p><p>In any of these cases, setting down the person you
      carry or pulling them onto dry land requires an action. Dropping them
      unceremoniously (dealing 1d6 of bludgeoning damage if onto a hard surface)
      can be done as a bonus action.</p>
