      <p dir="ltr">You can harness the primal fear of fire. You gain proficiency
      in Intimidation. If you were already proficient, you instead gain an
      expertise die. You suffer no penalties for attempting to use Intimidation
      on creatures that do not share a language with you, or who have no
      language, as the fear of fire transcends all language. Additionally, when
      you are under the effect of the Frightened condition, you make your attack
      rolls against the subject of your fear with advantage rather than
      disadvantage.</p>
