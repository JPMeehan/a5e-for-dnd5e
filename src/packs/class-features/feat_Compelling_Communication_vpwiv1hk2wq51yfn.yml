      <p>At 1st level, you can manipulate people with words as easily as a
      warrior can with physical force. You can spend an action to affect a
      creature within 30 feet that can understand you with any flourish trick
      that you have prepared other than Surgical Flourish, without making an
      attack.</p><p>At 6th level, the range you can affect a creature increases
      to 60 feet. Additionally, you gain the ability to use flourish tricks
      other than Surgical Flourish whenever you deal damage to a creature with
      your Weapon of Choice ability (see below).</p>
