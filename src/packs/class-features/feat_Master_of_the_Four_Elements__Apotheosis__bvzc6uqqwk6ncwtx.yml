      dir="ltr">You have mastered the four base elements, and discovered that
      through them all the other elements can be created. You can freely apply
      your augments to any blast, regardless of element requirements.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, you gain a bonus adaptation. This adaptation
      can be chosen from any that you qualify from, and you can freely retrain
      it for another you qualify for during a short or a long rest.</p>
