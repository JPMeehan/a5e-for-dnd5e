      <p>Beginning at 15th level you can cast a modified version of the
      <em>hallow</em> spell. The casting time is reduced to 1 hour, the duration
      is reduced to 8 hours, and it does not require material components. Once
      you do, you must finish a long rest before doing so again.</p>
