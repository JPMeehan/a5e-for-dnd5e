      <blockquote><p>At 6th level, you clearly contain the essence of something
      beyond mortal ken, and it provokes awe and wonder in those who witness
      your magic.</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Whenever you
      cast a spell from the divine school of 1st-level or higher, you are
      surrounded by an aura of awe that persists for a number of minutes equal
      to the spell level.</p><p>This aura may subtly provoke powerful feelings,
      or it could be overtly visible and fantastical; either way the effect is
      clearly magical.</p><ul><li><p>While this aura is active, you gain an
      expertise die on all <em>Persuasion </em>and <em>Intimidation
      </em>checks.</p></li><li><p>While this aura is active, you may choose to
      glow, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light an
      additional 30 feet beyond that (beginning or ending the glow is a bonus
      action).</p></li></ul>
