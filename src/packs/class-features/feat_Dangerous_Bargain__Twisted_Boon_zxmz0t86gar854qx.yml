      <p>At 6th level, you've mastered some of a hag's power of corrupted fey
      bargains. &nbsp;You gain the other option from A Blessing and a Curse that
      you did not already choose. &nbsp;Normal uses of the ability are shared
      between both. &nbsp;<br>You may also use either one without expending a
      use of the ability. &nbsp;If you do so to grant Witch's Blessing, then the
      next time after the affected roll that the affected creature succeeds on a
      roll of the same type (attack, check, or save), they are automatically
      affected by Witch's Curse. &nbsp;If you use it to impose a Witch's Curse,
      the next time after the affected roll that the affected creature fails a
      roll of the same type, they are automatically affected by a Witch's
      Blessing. &nbsp;Once you have used this ability on a particular creature
      for free, you cannot do so again on that creature until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
