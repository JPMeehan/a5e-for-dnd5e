      <p>At 20th level, you have achieved a rare level of achievement and
      prestige, gaining the following features. </p><h3><strong>Magesight
      </strong></h3><p>Your eyes become attuned to the supernatural. You cannot
      be blinded, and you can see normally in darkness, both magical and
      nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. </p><p>When you can see a creature
      use Spellcasting to cast a spell you instinctively know what spell is
      being cast before the casting is complete. This does not tell you what
      level spell slot is being used to cast the spell.</p><h3><strong>True
      Magician </strong></h3><p>When you have a 1st-level wizard spell prepared,
      you are able to cast it as a 1st-level spell without expending a spell
      slot.</p>
