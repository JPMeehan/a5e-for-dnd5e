      <p dir="ltr">At 8th level, you can protect your allies with the sheer
      power of your faith and care. When you or a friendly creature within 30
      feet of you are targeted with an attack or harmful spell or effect, you
      can use your reaction to force the creature that is the source of the
      attack or harmful spell or effect to make a Wisdom saving throw against
      your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacking creature must choose a
      different target or its attack, effect, or spell is canceled with no
      effect and the action is wasted. This feature cannot be used against area
      effects such as an explosion or a dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon. Once you
      have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,
      you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
