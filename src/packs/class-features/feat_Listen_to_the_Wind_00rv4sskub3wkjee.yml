      <p>Also at 2nd level you can use the wind to uncover secret information.
      By spending 10 minutes concentrating outside, you may cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.84xbuk6c7yo86ga7]{Locate Object}
      spell without expending a spell slot.</p><p>At 6th level you may instead
      cast @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.kk7n5fm5uz9xwrr2]{Locate
      Creature} in this way.</p><p>At 10th level you can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.ppht0do531mq84uw]{Scrying} in this
      way. Once you do so you cannot do so again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p><p>None of these spells function if the target is
      underwater, in a vacuum, in an airtight container, or otherwise does not
      have a path between you and it or them through the air, however small.</p>
