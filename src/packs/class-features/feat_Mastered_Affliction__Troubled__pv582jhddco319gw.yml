      dir="ltr">At 14th level, while you realize that you will never be free of
      your artifact&rsquo;s curse, you are so accustomed to it that attempts to
      make it worse skate off of you. You gain one of the following benefits
      based on your chosen affliction:</p><ul><li
      dir="ltr"><strong>Unmoored:</strong> You are immune to the Confused
      condition.</li><li dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Paranoid:</strong> You are immune to the
      Frightened condition.</li><li dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Troubled:</strong> You cannot be put to sleep
      magically and you are immune to being harmed or terrorized in your dreams
      (such as with the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.jo2vztvypvhqxh5u]{Dream}
      spell). You also ignore the effects of having one level of fatigue, though
      if you gain a second, both (and any additional) levels affect you
      normally.</li><li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Fettered:</strong>
      You are immune to the Slowed condition.</li><li dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Gravebound:</strong> If you are killed, a
      spellcaster does not have to spend material component costs to raise you
      from the dead with
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.0k5zymq9q95l8jwa]{Revivify},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.9zhsri19dkhm9mcf]{Raise Dead}, or
      similar magic.</li></ul>
