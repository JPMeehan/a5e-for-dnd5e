      <p>Your Divine Smite becomes deadlier to oppressors. Choose a number of
      organizations up to half your proficiency bonus. Members of these
      organizations, plus any creature involved in the slave trade as a supplier
      or customer, any creature with the Evil alignment trait, and any Fiend all
      take an additional die of damage from your Divine Smite. You may change
      the chosen organizations when you complete a long rest.</p>
