      Smite} becomes deadlier to oppressors. Choose a number of organizations up
      to half your proficiency bonus. Members of these organizations, plus any
      creature involved in the slave trade as a supplier or customer, any
      creature with the Evil alignment trait, and any Fiend all take an

      organizations when you complete a long rest.</p>
