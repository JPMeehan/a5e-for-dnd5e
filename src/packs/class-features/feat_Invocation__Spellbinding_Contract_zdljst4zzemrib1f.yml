      <p><em>Prerequisite: 9th level</em></p><p>You can
      cast&nbsp;<em>geas&nbsp;</em>once by spending 7 spell points. You cannot
      do so again until you finish a long rest. If the command of
      the&nbsp;geas&nbsp;is the stipulation of an agreement to which the target
      consents, the target automatically fails its saving throw against this
      spell.</p>
