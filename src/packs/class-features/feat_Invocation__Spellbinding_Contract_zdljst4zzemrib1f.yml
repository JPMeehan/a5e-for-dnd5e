      <p>You can cast <em>geas&nbsp;</em>once by spending 7 spell points. You
      cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. If the command of
      the&nbsp;geas&nbsp;is the stipulation of an agreement to which the target
      consents, the target automatically fails its saving throw against this
      spell.</p>
