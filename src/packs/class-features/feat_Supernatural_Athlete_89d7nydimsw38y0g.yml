      longer any obstacle to you.</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p>You gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed, and you
      may scale even sheer surfaces as long as you keep at least one hand and
      one foot in contact with the surface at all times.</p><p>You also learn
      the <em>feather fall</em> spell and may use it at will without expending a
      spell slot. </p><p>While falling, Acrobatics checks you make to aim for a
      specific landing spot are made at advantage. If you land in sufficiently
      loose and concealing material (such as a cart full of hay or a body of
      water), you can make a Stealth check to hide yourself as you land (no
      action required).</p>
