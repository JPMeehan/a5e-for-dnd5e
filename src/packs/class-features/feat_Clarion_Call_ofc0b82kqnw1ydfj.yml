      <p>You gain knowledge of the secret language of angels. You can speak,
      read, write, and sign <em>Celestial</em> if you couldn't already, and you
      know the <em>tongues</em> spell, it counts as a warlock spell, and it
      doesn't count against your number of spells known.</p><p>In addition, as
      an action you can use this knowledge to infuse your words with a semblance
      of divine authority when you call out. You may cast the <em>bless</em>
      spell a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. When you cast the
      spell in this way, it affects a number of creatures equal to your
      spellcasting ability modifier, has only a verbal component, and can only
      affect creatures that can hear and understand you. It counts as a first
      level spell. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
