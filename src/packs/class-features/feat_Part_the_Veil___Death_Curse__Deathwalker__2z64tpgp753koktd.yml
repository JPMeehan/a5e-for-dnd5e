      following:</p><p><strong>Death Curse</strong></p><p>You can use a bonus
      action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The
      curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or
      you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p><p>-
      When you deal damage against to cursed creature, it takes additional 1d4

      use it again until you finish a short or long
