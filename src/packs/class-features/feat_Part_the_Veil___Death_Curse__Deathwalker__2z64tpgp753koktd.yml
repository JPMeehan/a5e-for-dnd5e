      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">When you select this
      archetype at 1st level, you begin to learn how to manipulate the powers
      and energies of death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You
      learn the spare the dying cantrip, which does not count against your
      number of cantrips known.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Choose one of the
      following:</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Death
      Curse</strong></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You can use a bonus
      action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The
      curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or
      you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">- When you deal
      damage against to cursed creature, it takes additional 1d4 necrotic
      damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and
      20th level.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">- When that creature
      is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies, the curse ends, and you regain hit
      points equal to 1d8+your warlock level.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Once you have used
      this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Mortal
      Defiance</strong></s></p>
