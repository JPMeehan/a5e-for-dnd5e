      <p>You may perform an hour-long ritual to mark a suit of armor, and either
      a pair of weapons or a weapon and a shield. Thereafter, you may use your
      channel divinity as a bonus action to summon the marked items onto your
      body. The armor appears on your body and any weapon or shield appears in
      your hands. If you are wearing different armor or are carrying other
      items, they appear in a neat pile at your feet. This effect works at any
      distance, provided your marked items are on the same plane as you.</p>
