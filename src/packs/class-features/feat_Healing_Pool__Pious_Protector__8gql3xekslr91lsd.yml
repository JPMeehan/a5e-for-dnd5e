      <p>At 2nd level, you have learned to store up a stock of restorative
      energy that you can use to aid those who need your care. You have a
      healing pool equal to 3 x your pious protector level. When you restore hit
      points to a creature with a spell, class feature, or feat, you can draw
      upon this pool and cause the creature to heal an additional number of hit
      points of your choice.</p><p>This pool is restored at the end of a long
      rest.</p>
