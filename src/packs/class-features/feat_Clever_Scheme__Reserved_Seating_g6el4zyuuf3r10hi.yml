      <p>You have forethought of when and where you might need to be places. If
      you knew you would be in a given area, once per day you can call upon this
      forethought to have a vehicle or mount waiting for you and your
      companions, or to have a reservation available at a venue. You pay any
      appropriate costs. For exceptional requests, you may need to make a
      Persuasion check or owe someone a favor.</p>
