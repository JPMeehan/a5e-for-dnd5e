      <p>Your artifact transfers martial knowledge directly into your mind and
      reflexes. Choose and learn a combat tradition you don&rsquo;t already know
      and immediately learn a combat maneuver from that tradition of a degree
      you can currently perform. You may select this relic art more than once,
      choosing a different combat tradition and maneuver each time.</p>
