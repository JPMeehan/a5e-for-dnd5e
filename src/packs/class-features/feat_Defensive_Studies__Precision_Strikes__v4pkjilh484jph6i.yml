      <p>You have learned how to apply your knowledge and powers of observation
      to harming others. You may spend a bonus action to study a target. Any
      time you hit that target with a weapon attack before the end of your next
      turn, you deal an additional 1d8 damage to them of the same type as the
      attack. In addition, for the duration you may apply your Intelligence
      modifier to hit and damage with weapon attacks against this target instead
      of Strength or Dexterity. The bonus damage increases to 1d10 at 9th level,
      1d12 at 14th level, and 2d8 at 18th level.</p>
