      <p>Finally, at 3rd level, you have been trained to keep a very watchful
      eye out and summon reinforcements at the drop of a hat. You gain an
      expertise die on Perception checks and you can shout for aid as a reaction
      to seeing something that you deem suspicious or being attacked. In
      particular, this makes it very hard to silence you via spell or violence
      before you can shout for aid.</p>
