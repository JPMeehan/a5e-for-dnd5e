      <p>You become an almost impenetrable barrier for those you would keep from
      harm. As a bonus action, you may designate a number of creatures you can
      see equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) as your charges. Whenever
      one of those creatures is within 10 feet of you and is subject to an
      attack, you may spend 1 exertion to move adjacent to the creature and
      activate your <em>Get Behind Me</em> ability. You need not expend your
      reaction to use <em>Get Behind Me</em> when activated this way.</p>
