      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in
      four of the following skills and tool kits: Deception, Insight,
      Investigation, Stealth, disguise kit, poisoner&rsquo;s kit, or
      thieves&rsquo; tools. If you already have proficiency with a skill you
      select this way, you gain an expertise die with it instead.</p>

      <p>In addition, you can invent ciphers and are able to teach a cipher you
      create to others. Anyone who knows the cipher can encode and read hidden
      messages made with it; the apparent text must be at least four times
      longer than the hidden message. Other creatures can detect the presence of
      the cipher if they spend a minute examining it and succeed on an
      Investigation check against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, they can
      read the hidden message.</p>
