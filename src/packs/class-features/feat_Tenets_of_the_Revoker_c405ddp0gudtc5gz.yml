      <p>All revokers hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they
      serve.</p><ul><li><strong>Rise Above Your Past.</strong> Don&rsquo;t let
      your past define you. Judge others based on their actions now, not
      then.</li><li><strong>Learn From Mistakes.</strong> Never commit the same
      mistakes. Draw nowledge from every failure. Remind others that defeat
      should be a turning point, not a dead end.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Own
      Path.</strong> Allow no one, not even deities, to decide your destiny for
      you. Grab fate by the neck.</li><li><strong>Embrace Duty.</strong> Choose
      the life of a hero. Defend the weak, punish the guilty.</li></ul>
