      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to use sound to locate objects and creatures
      around you. As a bonus action, you can sing, stomp, or play a musical
      instrument, concentrating on your music as if it were a spell. Until the
      start of your next turn, any creature within 300 feet of you that can hear
      you automatically detects your presence, but you also gain blindsight with
      a range of 30 feet. If you already have blindsight, its range increases by
      30 feet.</p>
