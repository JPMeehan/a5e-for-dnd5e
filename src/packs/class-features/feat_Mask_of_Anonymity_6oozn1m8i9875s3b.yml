      <blockquote><blockquote><p>At level 3 when you select this archetype, you
      become supernaturally difficult to
      remember.</p></blockquote></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>You
      gain proficiency in <em>Stealth</em>; if you are already proficient, you
      instead gain an expertise die on Stealth checks.</p><p>You also gain the
      Stealth specialty <em>Anonymity</em>. Your maximum expertise die size for
      Stealth is d12 for you, rather than the usual limit of a d8.</p><p>As long
      as you make even a cursory effort to conceal your appearance (such as by
      wearing a hood, covering your lower face with a scarf, or wearing a domino
      mask), the memory of those who observe you will fixate on the concealing
      item rather than your actual facial features and dress. Those with a
      reason to remember identifying details about you must make an opposed
      Intelligence check at disadvantage against your passive Wisdom (Stealth)
      to recall useful information about you.</p><p>In addition, you learn to
      blend seamlessly into crowds. You gain an expertise die to Stealth while
      in crowds, and those attempting to pick you out from those around you do
      so with disadvantage.</p><p></p>
