      <p>Also at 3rd level, your battle hymns take a different tone, now
      specially prepared for bloody fights and hard fought victories. You learn
      an additional battle hymn chosen from Table: Battle Hymns, counting your
      bard level as double for the purposes of which battle hymns you meet the
      prerequisites for. This battle hymn does not count against your number of
      battle hymns known. When you reach 8th level, you may change one of your
      battle hymns for a new Victorious Hymn.</p>
