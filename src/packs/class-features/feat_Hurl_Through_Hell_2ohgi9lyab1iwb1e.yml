      <p>At 14th level, you can condemn a creature to see Hell in all its
      infernal glory. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this
      feature to instantly fling it through the most horrific vistas of the
      multiverse. The creature disappears&nbsp; until the end of your next turn,
      reppearing in the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied
      space. If the creature is not a fiend, it takes [[/r 10d10]] psychic,
      fire, or cold damage (your choice). Once you have used this feature, you
      canâ€™t do so again until you finish &nbsp;long rest.</p>
