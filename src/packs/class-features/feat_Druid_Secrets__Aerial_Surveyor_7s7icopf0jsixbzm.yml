      <p>You are at home soaring at dizzying heights and peering towards the
      horizon. You can familiarize yourself with a 5-mile radius area around you
      by spending a minute studying your surroundings while flying or at great
      heights. Once you familiarize yourself with an area in this way, you gain
      an expertise die on any Perception or Survival checks you make while
      outdoors in that area for the next 24 hours, and you cannot familiarize
      yourself with another area until you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p>
