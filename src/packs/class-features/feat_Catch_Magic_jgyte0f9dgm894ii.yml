      <p>Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, you gain the
      ability to touch magic itself and change its structure. When you are hit
      by a spell attack, you can use your reaction to absorb it, distilling it
      into a primal form of magic called mana, which you can eventually learn to
      harness. Make a spellcasting ability check opposed by the spellcaster. On
      a success, you negate the spell and convert it into a number of mana
      points equal to the level of the spell, regardless of the level of the
      spell slot it was cast with. Cantrips count as first level spells for this
      purpose. On a failure, or if you are unable to absorb the mana points that
      would be gained from the spell, it resolves normally.</p><p>The maximum
      number of mana points you can absorb equals your proficiency bonus. This
      resets at the end of a long rest and any remaining mana points
      disappear.</p>
