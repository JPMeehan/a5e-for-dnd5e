      <p>At 14th level your lifeforce becomes a locus of natural power. You gain
      an additional Primal Vitality or Ingrained Vitality feature you haven’t
      previously selected, and your choice of one of the
      following.</p><h3><strong>Noxious Miasma</strong></h3><p><em>Prerequisite:
      Deathly Nectar</em></p><p>Miasmic ichor runs through you and that which
      you grow. As an action you can expend a use of Wild Shape to cause
      yourself or a creature you’ve summoned to give off a noxious miasma in a
      10-foot radius for the next minute. Whenever a non-plant creature other
      than you starts its turn within the miasma’s radius or moves there for the
      first time on its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw against
      your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.</p><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>If you do not meet any of the prerequisites,
      instead you gain an additional Primal Vitality and an additional Ingrained
      Vitality feature you haven’t previously selected.</p>
