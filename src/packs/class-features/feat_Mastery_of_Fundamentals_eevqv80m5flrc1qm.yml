      <p>When you select this archetype at 3rd level basic melee damage you deal
      is equal to your unarmed strike damage. This stacks with the Total Combat
      focus feature if you later take that. You can use the grapple basic
      maneuver with in place of your bonus action martial arts attack, or one or
      more flurry of blows attacks.</p>
