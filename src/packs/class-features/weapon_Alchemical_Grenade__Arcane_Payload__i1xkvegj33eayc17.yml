    value: >-
      <p>This armed alchemical grenade explodes when it hits a target or at the
      end of your turn.</p><p>Whenever you hit a target with an alchemical
      grenade, each creature within 5 feet of the target makes a Dexterity
      saving throw or takes half as much damage as taken by the target (the
      target is immune to this effect). Whenever you miss with an armed
      alchemical grenade it explodes in a harmless location at the end of your
      turn.</p><h3><strong>Arcane Payload</strong></h3><p>A target hit by this
      grenade takes additional force damage and makes an Intelligence saving
      throw or is rattled until the end of its next turn.</p>
