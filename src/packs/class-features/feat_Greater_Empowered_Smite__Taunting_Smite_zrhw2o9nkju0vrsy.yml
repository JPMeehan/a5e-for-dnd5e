      <p>The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes an
      additional 1d6 radiant damage when attacking a creature other than you and
      cannot make opportunity attacks against anyone but you. This effect lasts
      up to 1 minute, and the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
      each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
