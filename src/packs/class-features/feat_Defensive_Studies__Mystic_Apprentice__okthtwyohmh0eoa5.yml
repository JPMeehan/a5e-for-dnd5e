      <p>While you are not truly a magic user per se, you have come to
      appreciate the usefulness of some minor magical talents for defending
      oneself, especially as an alternative to physical combat. You learn two
      cantrips of your choice from any spell list. Both cantrips must be from
      the same list, and at least one of them must deal damage. Unlike most
      scholar abilities, these are actual spells that follow the normal rules
      for spellcasting.</p>
