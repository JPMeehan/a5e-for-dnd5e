      <p>At 14th level, you can pass effortlessly through natural stone. You
      gain a burrowing speed equal to half your walking speed. You can burrow
      through nonmagical, unworked earth, and when you burrow in this way, you
      leave no tunnel behind you. If you&rsquo;re burrowing through stone and
      you end your movement inside the stone, you take bludgeoning damage equal
      to your level as it attempts to crush you.</p>

      <p>Additionally, stone in all its forms is no longer a hindrance to you.
      You ignore&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">difficult terrain</span>
      caused by molten rock, can walk on it as though it were solid, and take no
      damage from it unless submerged. Finally, your spells that manipulate
      stone can now be used on worked stone.</p>
