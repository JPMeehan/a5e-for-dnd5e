      <p>You can motivate your allies to keep going even when they are tired and
      hungry. Once between long rests, you can choose a number of allies equal
      to twice your<br>proficiency bonus who can hear or understand you. Each
      ally can travel an additional hour before needing to make a Constitution
      saving throw for a forced march.</p>
