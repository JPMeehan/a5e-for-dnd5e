      <p>You gain an expertise die on checks made with thieves’ tools. When you
      would trigger a mechanical trap on your turn, your alert senses warn you
      of danger before you complete the action. You may immediately end your
      turn in order to delay the trap’s effects until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
