      <p>Starting at 1st level, any musical instrument that you have proficiency
      with counts as a spell focus for the purposes of spellcasting. Although
      spells can be cast without these instruments, only targets that are able
      to perceive your performance can benefit from&nbsp;this feature. Whenever
      you finish a rest,&nbsp;choose one of the following as your
      Art<br>Specialty.</p>

      <p><strong>Percussion (Casabas, Castanets,&nbsp;Drums, Maracas).
      </strong>Any instrument played&nbsp;by being struck or scraped (either by
      other&nbsp;instruments or against each other)&nbsp;qualifies as a
      percussion instrument.&nbsp;When you cast a bard spell from the&nbsp;sound
      school using a percussion&nbsp;instrument as your spell focus, double
      the&nbsp;spell's range. A sound spell that has a&nbsp;range of Touch
      increases its range to 30&nbsp;feet.</p>

      <p><strong>String Instruments (Dulcimer, Harp, </strong><strong>Lute,
      Lyre, Violin). </strong>String instruments are played by plucking and
      twanging strings. When using a string instrument as a spell focus,
      whenever you cast a bard spell&nbsp;from the movement or
      teleportation&nbsp;school, you can target an additional&nbsp;creature
      within 15 feet of you.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Visual (Calligraphy, Dance, Light
      </strong><strong>Manipulation, Shapes). </strong>There are many&nbsp;ways
      to undertake a visual performance,&nbsp;whether through illustration,
      illusion&nbsp;magic, or legerdemain. When using visual&nbsp;art as a spell
      focus, whenever you cast a&nbsp;bard spell, you can make one ally that
      can&nbsp;see you the point of origin of that spell.&nbsp;You must be able
      to see any targets of the&nbsp;spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Voice (Humming, Insults, Oration, </strong><strong>Singing).
      </strong>When using this musical art as a spell focus, you have advantage
      on checks made to maintain concentration on a bard spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Wind Instruments (Bagpipes, Flute, Horn, Ocarina,
      Trombone).</strong> Any instrument played by passing air through it
      qualifies as a wind instrument. When you cast a bard spell using a wind
      instrument as a spell focus, you can make a Deception or Performance check
      as a part of casting the spell. Creatures with a passive Insight score
      equal to or less than the result of your check do not see or hear you cast
      the spell. Once you have used this feature three times, you cannot do so
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>
