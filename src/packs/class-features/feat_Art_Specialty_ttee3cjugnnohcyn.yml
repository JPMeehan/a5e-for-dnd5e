      <p>Starting at 1st level, any musical instrument that you have proficiency
      with counts as a spell focus for the purposes of spellcasting. Although
      spells can be cast without these instruments, only targets that are able
      to perceive your performance can benefit from&nbsp;this feature. Whenever
      you finish a rest,&nbsp;choose one of the following as your
      Art<br>Specialty.</p>

      <p><strong>Percussion (Casabas, Castanets,&nbsp;Drums, Maracas).
      </strong>Any instrument played&nbsp;by being struck or scraped (either by
      other&nbsp;instruments or against each other)&nbsp;qualifies as a
      percussion instrument.&nbsp;When you cast a bard spell from the&nbsp;sound
      school using a percussion&nbsp;instrument as your spell focus, double
      the&nbsp;spell's range. A sound spell that has a&nbsp;range of Touch
      increases its range to 30&nbsp;feet.</p>

      <p><strong>String Instruments (Dulcimer, Harp, </strong><strong>Lute,
      Lyre, Violin). </strong>String instruments are played by plucking and
      twanging strings. When using a string instrument as a spell focus,
      whenever you cast a bard spell&nbsp;from the movement or
      teleportation&nbsp;school, you can target an additional&nbsp;creature
      within 15 feet of you.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Visual (Calligraphy, Dance, Light
      </strong><strong>Manipulation, Shapes). </strong>There are many&nbsp;ways
      to undertake a visual performance,&nbsp;whether through illustration,
      illusion&nbsp;magic, or legerdemain. When using visual&nbsp;art as a spell
      focus, whenever you cast a&nbsp;bard spell, you can make one ally that
      can&nbsp;see you the point of origin of that spell.&nbsp;You must be able
      to see any targets of the&nbsp;spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Voice (Humming, Insults, Oration, </strong><strong>Singing).
      </strong>When using this musical art as&nbsp;a spell focus, you have
      advantage on&nbsp;checks made to maintain concentration on&nbsp;a bard
      spell.<br>Wind Instruments (Bagpipes, Flute,&nbsp;Horn, Ocarina,
      Trombone). Any&nbsp;instrument played by passing air through
      it&nbsp;qualifies as a wind instrument. When you&nbsp;cast a bard spell
      using a wind instrument&nbsp;as a spell focus, you can make
      a&nbsp;Deception or Performance check as a part&nbsp;of casting the spell.
      Creatures with a&nbsp;passive Insight score equal to or less than&nbsp;the
      result of your check do not see or hear&nbsp;you cast the spell. Once you
      have used&nbsp;this feature three times, you can&rsquo;t d</p>
