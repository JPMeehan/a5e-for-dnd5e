      <p>At 15th level, you can cast create undead without a spell slotor
      components. Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p><p>In addition, you can cast raise dead once
      per week without components. However, when you do, the target returns to
      life with two additional levels each of fatigue and strife. At the
      Narrator's option, they may also "come back wrong" in other ways, such as
      bleached white hair, disconcerting black veins, inky black eyes, and so
      on.</p>
