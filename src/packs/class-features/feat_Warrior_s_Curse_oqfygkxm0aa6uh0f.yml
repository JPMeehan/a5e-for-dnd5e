      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following
      effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>Choose magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage when you apply
      the curse. When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an
      additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at
      10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You gain a pool of defensive dice, which begins empty. Every time the
      cursed creature hits you with an attack, you gain a defensive die. You may
      spend one of your defensive dice as a reaction when you are hit with an
      attack, adding 1d4 to your AC against that attack and potentially turning
      the hit into a miss. You may not spend a defensive die on the attack that
      you acquired it from. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
