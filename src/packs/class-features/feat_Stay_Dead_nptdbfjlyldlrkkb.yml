      <p>At level 10, creatures you kill tend to stay dead, even when magic is
      involved. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a
      Constitution save against your maneuver DC. A creature that fails has
      disadvantage on death saving throws until it dies or stabilizes and it
      cannot be stabilized or healed by the Medicine skill or by magical healing
      unless it stabilizes on its own. At level 17, creatures affected by this
      feature also acquire the doomed condition.</p>
