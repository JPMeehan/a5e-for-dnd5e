      <p>In addition to the spells you normally prepare, you always have speak
      with dead prepared, and you can use this feature to cast it once between
      long rests without spending a spell slot. When you do so, you do not have
      to target a corpse; you can also target a grave marker, memorial, statue,
      painting, or other depiction of the deceased creature you wish to talk to.
      If the chosen creature is not dead, or if such a creature never existed in
      the first place, the spell fails.</p>
