      new mixes and concoctions come naturally to you. When you first gain this
      field discovery, you gain two schematics of your choice and add them to
      your schematic book. These schematics must be for potions of common or
      uncommon rarity. You gain proficiency with alchemistâ€™s supplies, or if you
      are already proficient you gain an expertise die instead. In addition, you
      have advantage on checks made to create schematics for potions.</p>
