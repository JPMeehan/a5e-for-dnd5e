      <p>On your turn, you say something to turn a foeâ€™s attention away from you
      or an ally. You or an ally of your choice who can understand you can move
      up to their speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from
      one creature of your choice that can understand you. If they end up having
      obscurement or cover relative to the distracted foe, they can Hide without
      spending an action.</p>
