      <p>You stand on the shoulders of giants, the power of your transformation
      literally swells you to meet the expectations of those that came before.
      You add the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ap6klied8mqbclvn]{Enlarge/Reduce}
      to your list of known wielder spells. In addition, when you use a bonus
      action to enter your torchbearer form you may choose to cast the spell
      <em>enlarge/reduce</em> on yourself at 2nd level without expending any
      additional artifact charges as a part of the same bonus action. Spells you
      cast in this way end when you leave your torchbearer form.</p>
