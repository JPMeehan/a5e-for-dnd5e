      <p>When attacking one of your <em>Studied Adversaries</em> you may
      increase the benefits of your <em>T</em><em>rained Accuracy</em> ability
      as if you had expended one additional use, to a maximum equivalent of 3
      uses. &nbsp;Once you have done so against a specific creature, you cannot
      do so again against that creature for 24 hours.</p>
