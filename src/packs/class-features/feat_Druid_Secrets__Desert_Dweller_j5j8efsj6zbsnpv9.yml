      <p>Few choose to willingly live where the sun relentlessly burns overhead
      but you find tranquility amongst the sands. You are naturally acclimatized
      to hot weather and extremely high temperatures. In addition, while in a
      desert or similar arid environment you can spend 1 hour scouring the area
      for food and digging for water to generate 1 Supply. Once you use this
      feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p>
