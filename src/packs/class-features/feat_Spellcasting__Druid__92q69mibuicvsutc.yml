      <p>Drawing on the power of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape
      nature&rsquo;s essence to your will.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level,
      you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn
      additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
      Cantrips Known column of the Druid Spells table.</p><h3>Preparing and
      Casting Spells</h3><p>The Druid Spells table shows how many spell slots
      you have to cast your druid spells. To cast one of these druid spells, you
      must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all
      expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the
      list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
      druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to
      your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells
      must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting spells
      doesn&rsquo;t remove them from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can
      change your list of prepared spells whenever you finish a long rest by
      meditating for at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
      list.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting
      ability for your druid spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers
      to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
      when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when
      making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 +
      your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack
      modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
      modifier</p><h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast a druid spell as a
      ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell
      prepared.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use a nature focus as a
      spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>
