      <p>Drawing on the power of nature itself, you can&nbsp;cast spells to
      shape nature&rsquo;s essence to your will.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Cantrips</h2>

      <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell
      list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels,
      as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid Spells table.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Preparing and Casting Spells</h2>

      <p>The Druid Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      druid spells. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of
      the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
      when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to
      cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number
      of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum
      of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
      slots. Casting spells doesn&rsquo;t remove them from your list of prepared
      spells.</p>

      <p>You can change your list of prepared spells whenever you finish a long
      rest by meditating for at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on
      your list.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Spellcasting Ability</h2>

      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your
      Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
      you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid
      spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Wisdom modifier</p>

      <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your
      Wisdom modifier</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Ritual Casting</h2>

      <p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
      and you have the spell prepared.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Spellcasting Focus</h2>

      <p>You can use a nature focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid
      spells.</p>
