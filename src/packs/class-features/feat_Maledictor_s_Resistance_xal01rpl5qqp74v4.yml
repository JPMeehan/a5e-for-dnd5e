      an expertise die on saves against spells of the Affliction school as well
      as any magical effect originating from a source outside yourself that
      would result in you being charmed, frightened, petrified, poisoned,
      slowed, cause you to gain levels of fatigue or strife, impose disadvantage
      on one or more of your saving throws, cause you to become vulnerable to
      one or more types of damage, or result in your infection with a
      disease.</p>
