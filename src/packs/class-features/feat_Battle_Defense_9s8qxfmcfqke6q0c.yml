      <p>Starting at 1st level, you decide on how best to protect yourself on
      the battlefield&mdash;relying on barbaric might or encased in weighty
      armaments. Choose one of the following options.</p>

      <h2>Juggernaut</h2>

      <p>You gain proficiency with heavy armor. In addition, your speed is not
      reduced by wearing heavy armor, you can still benefit from raging while
      wearing heavy armor, and you do not count the weight of any worn armor
      when determining your carrying capacity.</p>

      <h2>Rugged Defense</h2>

      <p>While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your
      Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and
      still gain this benefit.</p>

      <p>In addition, your speed increases by 5 feet while you aren&rsquo;t
      wearing heavy armor. At 5th level, your speed increases by an additional 5
      feet.</p>
