      <p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to exert extra force into your
      swings. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can
      expend exertion points to deal an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage per
      exertion point spent. The maximum amount of exertion points you can spend
      in this way on a single attack is equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
