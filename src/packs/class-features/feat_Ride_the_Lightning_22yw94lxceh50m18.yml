      <p>As part of a&nbsp;<em>lightning blast</em> attack, you become a bolt of
      lightning and travel along with the blast. You appear at the end of the
      blast&rsquo;s path, adjacent to the blast&rsquo;s target (or final target
      if it has multiple targets), or at the center of a burst or spread for
      shape augmentations like burst. This cannot be used with melee blasts or
      cone shaped blasts.</p>
