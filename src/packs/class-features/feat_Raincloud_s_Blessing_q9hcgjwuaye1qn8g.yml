      <p>Also at 6th level, you learn to perform a special magical ritual that
      can change the weather in a region for up to a year. The ritual affects an
      area in acres up to your druid level squared. At the beginning of the
      ritual, you can choose either hardship or plenty.</p><p>If you choose
      hardship, for the next year, the weather will make life very difficult in
      the area you selected. The specific nature the hardship takes is up to the
      Narrator, but it may include droughts, flooding, high winds that damage
      structures and cause soil erosion, and even highly-severe weather like
      hurricanes and tornadoes. Skilled farmers may be able to eke out a meager
      harvest, but it is likely that the region will have severe crop shortages
      at best. If there are strongholds or properties in the region, there is a
      25% chance each month that something happens to damage them.</p><p>If you
      choose plenty, the opposite happens. Rains are gentle, regular, and enough
      to ensure a bountiful harvest without flooding local waterways or damaging
      structures. Weather throughout the year will be mild. Local agriculture
      will produce more than enough to make everyone in the region well-fed and
      happy, with plenty left over to trade. If there are strongholds or
      properties in the area, the cost to upgrade them from frugal to average is
      halved during the year of plenty.</p>
