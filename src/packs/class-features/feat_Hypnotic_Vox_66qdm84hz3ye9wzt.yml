      <p>At 6th level, you are able to keep people and creatures’ attention
      focused on you. Spend an action to cause creatures of your choice that can
      perceive you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your trick save DC.
      Creatures that don’t understand your language have advantage on the saving
      throw. Creatures that cannot be charmed automatically succeed their saving
      throws, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it makes
      its saving throw with advantage .</p><p>On a failure, a creature is
      charmed by you for as long as you continue talking (with reasonable
      pauses, perhaps even conversation back and forth) and for the next hour
      after. While charmed by you, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom
      (Perception) checks made to perceive creatures other than you.</p><p>The
      focus required for this mesmerism is mentally taxing. Once you use this
      feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
      again.</p>
