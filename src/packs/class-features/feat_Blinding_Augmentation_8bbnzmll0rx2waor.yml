      spending 3 spell points, your blast manifests with a bright flash of
      light. Targets who are hit or who fail their saving throws are blinded for
      1 round. If you spend 2 additional spell points, targets are blinded for 1
      minute, though they can attempt a Constitution saving throw at the end of
      each of their turns to end the effect.</span></p>
