      <p>You are immune to necrotic damage, you are immune to disease, and you
      cannot be magically aged. When you kill a creature, you can either reduce
      your apparent age or extend your life span by a number of years equal to
      the creature&rsquo;s CR.&nbsp;When you would die of old age, you instead
      become undead, gaining the skeleton or zombie template&nbsp;with no
      changes to your ability scores.</p>
