      <p>The language spoken by the builders of your bonded artifact flows
      directly through your mind without all the trouble of learning it first so
      long as you hold your artifact. Select a language spoken by beings
      associated with your artifact (or ask your narrator for one if that
      information isn&rsquo;t known to you), you learn how to speak, read,
      write, and sign your chosen language while you remain in contact with your
      bonded artifact.</p>
