      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you have advantage on saving throws against
      divination spells and effects, as well as immunity to any effect that
      would force you to reroll a die, though you may choose to accept
      beneficial rerolls.</p><p>This feature does not apply to rolling with
      disadvantage, as that calls for 2 separate rolls.</p>
