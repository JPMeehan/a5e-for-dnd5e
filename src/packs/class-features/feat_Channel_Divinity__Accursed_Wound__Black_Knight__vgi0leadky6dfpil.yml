    value: >-
      <p>When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can use your channel
      divinity to curse the wound (no action required). The target of the attack
      takes an additional 1d8 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution
      saving throw against your spell save DC. If the target fails, it cannot
      regain hit points until it finishes a long rest. If it succeeds, its
      maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage done by
      your attack until it finishes a long rest.</p>
