      <p>Your artifact is strongly linked to a combat tradition and you find
      such maneuvers easier with it in your hands. Choose a combat tradition you
      know maneuvers in, you can spend artifact charges for maneuvers of your
      chosen tradition as if they were exertion points at a cost of one charge
      per exertion point, instead of expending 2 charges per exertion point as
      normal using your charged exertion feature. You may select this relic art
      multiple times, choosing a different combat tradition each time.</p>
