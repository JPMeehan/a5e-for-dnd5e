    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, creatures with the Beast type have a default attitude one
      step higher than normal toward you. Normally-hostile creatures will be
      indifferent, and creatures that would normally be indifferent are
      friendly. In addition, you are continuously under the effect of the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.z5a26lxyh3esw2rl]{Speak
      with Animals}</em>&nbsp;spell, and you have advantage on checks to
      persuade Beasts to help you with non-hazardous tasks. This effect does not
      emit a magic aura.</p>
