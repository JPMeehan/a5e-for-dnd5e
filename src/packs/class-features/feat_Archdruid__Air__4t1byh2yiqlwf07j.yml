      <p>You can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no
      matter your form. Once each turn, you can use a bonus action to choose a
      target point within 30 feet and one of the following element options. If
      the element you choose is not present at or near the target point, any
      damage dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your
      spell attack, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to
      resist it.</p><p><strong>Air.</strong> Each creature within 20 feet of
      that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes
      bludgeoning damage equal to 3d8 + your Wisdom modifier and is flung up 20
      feet away from the target point in a random direction and knocked prone.
      If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target
      takes&nbsp;1d8&nbsp;bludgeoning damage. If the target is thrown at another
      creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against
      your spell save DC or it takes the same damage and is knocked prone. If
      the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning
      damage and isnâ€™t flung away or knocked prone.</p><p>In addition, all
      ranged attacks within 30 feet of the target point have disadvantage until
      the beginning of your next turn.&nbsp;</p>
