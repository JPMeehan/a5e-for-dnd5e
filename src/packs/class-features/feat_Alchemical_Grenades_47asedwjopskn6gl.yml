      <p>When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
      a special type of rare ranged weapon called an
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.xo9lrlqmwlsr7j09]{Alchemical
      Grenade}, and you may use your Intelligence when making attack and damage
      rolls with them. You can use a bonus action to arm an alchemical grenade.
      An armed alchemical grenade explodes when it hits a target or at the end
      of your turn.</p>

      <p>Alchemical grenades are thrown weapons with a range of 20/60 feet, and
      when an armed alchemical grenade hits a target it deals 1d6 force damage.
      This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and
      17th level (maximum 4d6). Whenever you hit a target with an alchemical
      grenade, each creature within 5 feet of the target makes a Dexterity
      saving throw or takes half as much damage as taken by the target (the
      target is immune to this effect). Whenever you miss with an armed
      alchemical grenade it explodes in a harmless location at the end of your
      turn.</p>

      <p>You can use this feature to arm a number of alchemical grenades equal
      to your proficiency bonus. Creating these alchemical grenades has no
      material costs. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or
      long rest by mixing chemicals and soldering together new shells for later
      use. You cannot regain expended uses in this way if you don&rsquo;t have
      access to tools of artifice.</p>

      <p>Whenever you arm an alchemical grenade, you may select one of the
      following grenade types.</p>

      <p>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.m39iu7vdled4o3k4]{Alchemical
      Grenade (Acid Core)}
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.i1xkvegj33eayc17]{Alchemical
      Grenade (Arcane Payload)}
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.awda8j2hq3mq6c2z]{Alchemical
      Grenade (Combustible)}
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.ccsvwlrci5ggvgbn]{Alchemical
      Grenade (Flashbang)}</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3><strong>Acid Core<br></strong></h3>

      <p>A target hit by this grenade takes an additional 1d4 ongoing acid
      damage that persists until it submerges itself in water or uses an action
      to wipe the acid off. This ongoing acid damage increases by 1d4 when you
      reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level (maximum 4d4).</p>

      <h3><strong>Arcane Payload</strong></h3>

      <p>To select this grenade type, you must expend an infusion use.</p>

      <p>A target hit by this grenade takes an additional 1d12 force damage and
      makes an Intelligence saving throw or is rattled until the end of its next
      turn. This additional force damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th
      level, 11th level, and 17th level (maximum 4d12).</p>

      <h3><strong>Combustible</strong></h3>

      <p>A target hit by this grenade takes 1d6 additional fire damage. This
      additional fire damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level, 11th
      level, and 17th level (maximum 4d6). Flammable objects within 5 feet of
      the target that aren&rsquo;t being worn or carried ignite, taking 1d6
      ongoing fire damage until a creature uses an action to smother the
      flames.</p>

      <h3><strong>Flashbang</strong></h3>

      <p>A target hit by this grenade makes a Constitution saving throw or is
      blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
