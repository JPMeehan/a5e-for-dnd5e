      <p>There&rsquo;s always a better trap design if you put your mind to it.
      You can improve fishing traps, hunting snares, and hunting traps as you
      set them. Hunting traps you improve in this way are always considered
      masterwork hunting traps. Whenever you retrieve an improved fishing trap
      or hunting snare, you may add a d6 to the result determining how much
      Supply has been captured. </p>
