      <p>At 3rd level, your visage becomes supernaturally terrifying when you
      rage. Hostile creatures within 30 feet that see you raging must make a
      Wisdom save against your maneuver DC or become rattled for one minute. A
      creature that fails its save by 5 or more is instead frightened instead
      for the duration. An affected creature can repeat the save at the end of
      each of its turns. On a success, a frightened creature becomes rattled,
      and a rattled creature ends the effect. Once a creature succeeds on its
      initial save against this effect or recovers from it, that creature is
      immune to it for 24 hours.</p>
