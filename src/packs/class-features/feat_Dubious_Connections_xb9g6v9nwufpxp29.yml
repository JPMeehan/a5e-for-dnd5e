      <p>Also beginning at 2nd level, you have cultivated certain useful
      contacts, who can help you get what you need for your studies at a reduced
      rate as long as you donâ€™t ask too many questions about where they came
      from. As long as you are in a community with at least 2,000 residents, you
      can purchase expensive spell components at a 20% discount and consumable
      magic items such as potions and scrolls at a 10% discount.</p>
