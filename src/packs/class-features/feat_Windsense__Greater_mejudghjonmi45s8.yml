      <p dir="ltr">By spending at least 10 minutes silently meditating, you can
      extend your senses through the air. This allows you to see and hear at a
      distance of 1,000 feet from you, as long as there are no barriers blocking
      airflow. You are able to move your senses at a speed of 100 feet per
      round, and you create a flowing current of air at the point you are
      sensing that can be noticed, with a Perception DC equal to your spell save
      DC. You can only focus your senses on one point at a time, and you are
      unaware of your actual surroundings while using this ability.</p>
