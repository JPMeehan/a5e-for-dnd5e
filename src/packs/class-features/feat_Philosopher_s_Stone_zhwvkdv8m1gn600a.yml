      <p>At 18th level you accomplishes the ultimate feat of alchemy: the
      creation of a philosopher's stone. Using this stone allows you to do the
      following:</p><h2>Lead to Gold</h2><p>You may turn any amount of a less
      valuable metal into an equivalent amount of gold.</p><h2>Elixir of
      Youth</h2><p>Once per year you may use your philosopher's stone to brew an
      elixir of youth, expending an additional 10,000 gp worth of materials when
      doing so and taking 8 hours. When a creature takes this elixir, they do
      not age during the next year, are immune to disease and magical aging, and
      that year does not count towards the creature's maximum lifespan. The
      first time they do so it also reduces them to their "prime physical age",
      mid twenties for a human or equivalent for other heritages. It may also be
      used as a reusable spell component that is not consumed for all
      resurrection spells, and a creature holding it may expend a hit die to
      replicate the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.0k5zymq9q95l8jwa]{Revivify},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.9zhsri19dkhm9mcf]{Raise Dead}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.zontlhypt3b5gk6z]{Resurrection}
      spells each once per year, suffering the normal penalties from the spells
      if appropriate.</p>
