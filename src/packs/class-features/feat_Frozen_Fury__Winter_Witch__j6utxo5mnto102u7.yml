      <p>At 14th level you always have the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style:
      normal;">flesh to stone</em> spell prepared and it doesn&rsquo;t count
      against your number of prepared spells. It counts as a <em>cold</em> spell
      for you and you can cast it without expending a spell slot at 6th level
      once per long rest. It turns the creature into ice rather than stone,
      though this ice does not melt normally.</p>
