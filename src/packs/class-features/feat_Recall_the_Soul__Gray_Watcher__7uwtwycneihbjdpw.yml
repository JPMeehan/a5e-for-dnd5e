      <p>At 14th level you always have the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style:
      normal;">resurrection</em> spell prepared, it does not count against your
      number of prepared spells, and once per long rest you may cast it without
      expending a spell slot. In addition, if a creature has been dead for less
      than a year, you may cast this spell to raise them without requiring a
      material component. Once you have raised a particular creature this way,
      you may not raise that same creature in this way again, and doing so is
      exhausting, inflicting penalties as if the target has been dead for over 1
      year.</p>
