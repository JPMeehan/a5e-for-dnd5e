      <p>Your patron&rsquo;s revelation grants you knowledge of a lifegiving
      secret. You gain a pool of solace dice, which represents your
      patron&rsquo;s help in accessing the shreds of magical grace which suffuse
      the multiverse. Your solace dice pool contains a number of d6s equal to 1
      + your warlock level.</p>

      <p>As a bonus action, you can heal a creature you can see within 60 feet.
      Spend solace dice up to an amount equal to your spellcasting ability
      modifier (minimum 1). Roll these dice; the creature regains that many hit
      points.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, when you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack,
      before rolling for damage you learn whether or not that creature has
      temporary hit points. You can immediately expend solace dice up to an
      amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1), roll those
      dice, and remove from the creature a number of temporary hit points equal
      to double that total.</p>

      <p>You regain any spent solace dice when you complete a long rest.</p>
