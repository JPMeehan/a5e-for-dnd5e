      <p>At 18th level, your ability to prevent the warping of reality reaches
      its apex. As a bonus action, you can spend 4 sorcery points and create a
      dimensional exclusion zone around yourself for 1 hour. The zone extends 60
      feet from you. Nothing can teleport into or out of the zone, invisible
      creatures and objects instantly become visible upon entering the zone, and
      all creatures inside it are affected as if by a zone of truth spell.</p>
