      <p>At 1st Level you are given a magical gift in the form of a guide, tutor
      and aide. you know the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find
      Familiar} spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn't count against
      your number of prepared spells. In addition, your familiar is blessed with
      various additional benefits as you level up.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, over the course of a short or long rest you may choose to
      feed and empower your familiar. This could be purely magical by meditating
      to return a portion of the magic and spiritual energies you drew through
      it, or it could be more literal by feeding it some of your blood or
      letting it suckle at one of your teats. Regardless of the exact means,
      doing so grants your familiar temporary hit points equal to 2 x your witch
      level.</p>

      <p>When you reach 7th level, after using an action to perceive through
      their familiar's senses you may continue doing so without need for further
      action until you use an action to end it. Once per short or long rest,
      while perceiving through your familiar's senses you may cast a spell
      through them as if it had originated from them and using their line of
      sight.</p>

      <p>When you reach 13th level, your familiar gains advantage or saving
      throws against spells and magical effects, and they share this bonus with
      you as long as you are both within 10 feet of each other. At 17th level
      the range of this ability increases to 30 feet.</p>
