    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, any hostile creature that begins its turn
      inside your Whirling Winds aura makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 +
      your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). The creature takes
      thunder or lightning damage (the same type as Touched by Thunder) equal to
      your berserker level on a failed save, or half as much on a successful
      save.</p>
