      <p>Also at 14th level, while you are under the effects of Carried Aloft
      and at least 50 feet off the ground, you may expend 2 uses of Wild Shape
      to surround yourself with a terrifying whirlwind made of razor-sharp
      shards. You are surrounded by simultaneous<em>
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.u8e2yij8vcq0puxl]{Blade
      Barrier}</em>&nbsp;and
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.n7v09ab1hwk8cupe]{Wind
      Wall}</em>&nbsp;effects, each extending 5 feet out from your space. You
      must concentrate to maintain this effect (as per a spell), and it lasts
      for up to 10 minutes.</p>
