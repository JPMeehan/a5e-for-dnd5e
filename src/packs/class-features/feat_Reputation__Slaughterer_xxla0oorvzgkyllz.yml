    value: >-
      <p>Tales of your merciless bloodshed have won you friends in unlikely
      places. Bandit and pirate captains, crimelords, intelligent monsters of
      ill intent, and even fiends know who you are and that you are a valuable
      ally, doing their best to persuade you to take up the sword against their
      enemies. Whenever you encounter such a creature, it spends its first
      action (even in combat) declaring that it knows of your prowess and
      offering an alliance.</p>
