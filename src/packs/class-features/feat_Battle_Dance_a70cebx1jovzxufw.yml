      <p>You gain proficiency in the Performance skill. As a bonus action, you
      can spend 2 exertion to bob and sway, starting a battle dance. Until the
      end of your turn, your Speed increases by 20 feet and opportunity attacks
      against you are made with disadvantage. When a creature makes an
      opportunity attack against you and misses, you can use your reaction to
      make an unarmed strike against that creature.</p>
