      <p>Also at 20th level, no portal&mdash;be it door, window, or planar
      device&mdash;is closed to you. You no longer need to make ability checks
      to pick locks, and you succeed automatically whenever you attempt to
      unlock any lock of any kind. You require no special equipment to use this
      feature.</p>
