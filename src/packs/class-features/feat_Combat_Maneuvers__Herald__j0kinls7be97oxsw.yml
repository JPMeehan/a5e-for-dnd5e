      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers.
      You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Sanguine Knot</li>

      <li>Spirited Steed</li>

      <li>Tempered Iron</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are
      proficient with.</p>

      <p>You use your maneuvers by spending exertion points, but you do not gain
      an exertion pool. Instead, at the start of each of your turns you can
      expend spell slots of 1st-level or higher to gain exertion points that go
      into a temporary exertion pool which lasts until you start your next long
      rest . You gain 2 exertion points for a 1st-level spell slot, and 2 more
      for each spell slot level above 1st. Only spell slots gained from the
      herald class can be expended in this way.</p>

      <p>The Maneuvers Known column of the Herald table shows when you learn
      more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the
      Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers
      from at a given level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
      the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
      degree from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>
