      <p>At 6th level you gain additional benefits when using the Visual art
      specialty as a spell focus. If you cast a spell has vocalized components
      you can ignore those components as long as you are capable of performing a
      seen component, and a spell cast in this way gains a seen component if it
      does not already have one; if you cast a spell that requires a target to
      hear you, you can use it on any target that can see
      you.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, while using the Visual art specialty as your
      spell focus if you make a spell attack roll and miss or force a creature
      to make a saving throw and they succeed you can expend a use of bardic
      inspiration as a reaction to make a performance check, applying the dance
      specialty if you have it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>You can replace your spell attack roll or your spell save DC with
      the result of the check, potentially altering the result of the roll.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can do so a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p>
