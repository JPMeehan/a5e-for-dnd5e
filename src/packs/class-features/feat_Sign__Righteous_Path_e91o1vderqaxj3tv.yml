    value: >-
      <p>Divine intuition guides you through the tangled paths of constructed or
      inhabited areas without confusion. Once per day you may choose to walk the
      Righteous Path for 1 hour. While walking the Righteous Path, you are aware
      when enemies are within 60 feet of you, and you know if backtracking or
      alternate routes could avoid them. You can also use an action to sense if
      there are traps within 30 feet, but not the location or nature of the
      traps.</p>
