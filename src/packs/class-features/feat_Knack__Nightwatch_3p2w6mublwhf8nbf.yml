      <p>You are used to sleeping light and making the most of your rest. When
      taking a long rest, add your proficiency bonus to the number of hours you
      can spend in light activity. In addition, one hour of that time can be
      spent in strenuous activity near the rest site (such as patrolling,
      fighting, or other adventuring activities) without interrupting your
      rest.</p>
