      <p>You are able to channel Nature's Magic as a way to&nbsp;steal your
      attackers potential to expand yours.</p>

      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you are hit by an attack from a creature
      you can see within 120 feet, you can use your reaction to make a melee or
      ranged spell attack against the creature. On a hit, the creature takes 1d6
      force damage, and you gain an equal amount of exertion point. The amount
      of exertion points gained this way increases by 1 when you reach 11th
      level, and again at 15th level.</p>

      <p>When you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips
      until the end of your next turn.</p>

      <p>When you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
