    value: >-
      <p>If you spend 10 minutes befriending and feeding a Medium or smaller
      beast of CR 1/8 or less, you become its guardian ranger. It follows you
      and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its
      own initiative and acts on its own turn. The beast wonâ€™t attack except as
      a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal and
      makes death saving throws. You can only be a guardian ranger to one beast
      at a time.</p>
