      <p>Your constant exposure to text has increased your reading speeds beyond
      the mortal norm. You can read a page of normal text as an action. You can
      also apply this to magical scrolls. If casting a spell from a spell scroll
      would normally take an action, you may cast the spell from the scroll as a
      bonus action instead.</p>
