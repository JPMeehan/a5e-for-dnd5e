      <p>You gain an expertise die on Religion checks. You may treat a holy
      relic (small idol, totem, prayer beads) as if it were a sacred site for
      the purposes of the Religious Devotion downtime activity. Additionally,
      you can perform the Religious Devotion downtime activity in only an hour
      by using a special ritual. Once you use this ritual, you cannot do so
      again for one week.</p>
