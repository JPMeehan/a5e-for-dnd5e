      <p>At 11th level, as an action you can suggest an activity (limited to a
      sentence or two) to a creature that can hear and understand you. A
      creature that canâ€™t be charmed is immune to this feature. The course of
      action must sound reasonable, as with the <em>suggestion
      </em>spell.</p><p>If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw , it pursues
      the course of action you described to the best of its ability for as long
      as you are present, and for up to 10 minutes after.</p><p>Once you use
      this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
      again.</p>
