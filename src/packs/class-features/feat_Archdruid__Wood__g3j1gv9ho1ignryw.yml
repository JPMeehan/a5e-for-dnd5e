      <p>You can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no
      matter your form. Once each turn, you can use a bonus action to choose a
      target point within 30 feet and one of the following element options. If
      the element you choose is not present at or near the target point, any
      damage dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your
      spell attack, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to
      resist it.</p><p><strong>Wood.</strong> Splinters appear and fling
      themselves into flesh and armor alike. Creatures within 20 feet of the
      target point take 4d6 piercing damage. A creature that makes a Dexterity
      saving throw against your spell save DC takes half damage.</p>
