      <p>When you select this archetype at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action
      to mark a creature for sacrifice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span></p><p>Once on your turn, when you deal damage to this creature, it
      takes additional fire damage equal to your wisdom modifier.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When it dies, if the creature had
      a CR no lower than half your level, you gain a Burning Boon charge. You
      can only have a number of Burning Boon charges at a time equal to your
      proficiency bonus.</p><p>You can expend a Burning Boon charge as an action
      to cast the <em>bless</em> spell at 1st level without expending a spell
      slot, and can expend additional charges to increase the effective spell
      slot level of <em>bless</em> by 1 per charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p>You can only mark a creature in this way once
      per short rest, and lose any Burning Boon charges when you finish a long
      rest.</p>
