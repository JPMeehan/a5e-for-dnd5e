      <p>At 17th level, you gain a token from the gods. While you are wearing
      the token, you are immune to fatigue and the blinded, deafened, and
      poisoned conditions. In addition, you can spend 1 exertion to use your
      Blessed Prowess feature on any ability check, and you don&rsquo;t need to
      spend exertion to use Sacred Boons. Finally, when you roll initiative, you
      can roll your martial arts die and regain that much exertion.</p><p>If
      your Eternal Favor token is destroyed, the gods bestow another token upon
      you after you complete an arduous task to prove you are still worthy.</p>
