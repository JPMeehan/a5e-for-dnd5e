      <p>At 17th level, the gods that watch over you grant you a token of their
      appreciation. This commonly takes the place of a gold medal, but it can be
      any other trinket of similar size. While you are wearing the item, you are
      immune to the blinded, deafened, fatigue, and poisoned conditions. In
      addition, you can spend 1 exertion to use your Blessed Prowess feature on
      any ability check and you donâ€™t need to spend exertion to call upon Sacred
      Boons. Finally, when you roll initiative and are wearing your Eternal
      Favor, you roll your martial arts die and regain that much
      exertion.</p><p>If your Eternal Favor is destroyed, the gods bestow
      another token upon you after you complete an arduous task to prove you are
      still worthy.</p><p>[[/r 1d4 #d4 die]] [[/r 1d6 #d6 die]] [[/r 1d8 #d8
