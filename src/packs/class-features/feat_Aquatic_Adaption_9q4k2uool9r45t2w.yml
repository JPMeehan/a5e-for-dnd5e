    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">At 2nd level when you select this archetype, you learn to
      adapt to coastal environs and are equally comfortable in the water and on
      land.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If you do not have a swim speed or a walking speed, you gain whichever
      you are missing now. If you have both, but one is slower, the slower speed
      increases to match the faster speed.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You can breathe air and water, and if you normally need to spend a
      certain amount of time in water every so often, that limitation is
      removed. Finally if you are roughly humanoid in shape, you can shift your
      form to adapt to water or land mobility. As an action, you perform a
      limited form of wild shape that fuses your legs into a swimming tail. If
      your default form has a swimming tail, you can instead split it into
      walking legs.</p>

      <p>It is also impossible to disorient you in water through non-magical
      means. While in the water you always know which way is north and you have
      an instinctive sense of how far you are from dry land in any given
      direction.. If you are under water, you know which way the surface is and
      how far you are from it.</p>
