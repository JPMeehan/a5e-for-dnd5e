      <p>Also at 2nd level, you gain one of the following benefits, which
      represents a minor talent you&rsquo;ve picked up over the course of your
      studies.</p>

      <h2>Bend Magic</h2>

      <p>When you cast a wizard spell with an instantaneous duration that deals
      damage to an area, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your
      Intelligence modifier in the area that you can see. The chosen creatures
      take no damage from the spell.</p>

      <h2>Flash of Insight</h2>

      <p>You can use a bonus action to roll a d20, record the result, and choose
      a creature you can see within 30 feet. The next time that creature makes
      an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it takes that d20 result
      instead of rolling. If you use this feature again before finishing a short
      rest, you must sacrifice a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to do so.</p>

      <h2>Quick Step</h2>

      <p>After you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you can
      immediately move up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks or
      spending any of your normal movement.</p>
