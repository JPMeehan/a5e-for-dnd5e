      <p>Beginning at level 10, your supernatural transformation takes on an
      even more powerful aspect. Your very flesh transforms into lava while you
      rage, making you even more durable. You are immune to fire damage, and
      while you are raging, treat critical hits that you suffer as normal
      hits.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, while you are raging, any creature that
      grapples you, that you grapple, or that begins its turn grappling or
      grappled by you takes 1d6 fire damage as the searing heat of your molten
      insides burns it.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, while you are raging, you may
      ignite flammable materials with a touch as a bonus action.</p>
