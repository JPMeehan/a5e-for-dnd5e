      <p>Beasts understand anything you verbally communicate in Druidic, and you
      can comprehend them in return. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts
      is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum beasts can give you
      information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they
      have perceived within the past day. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion,
      you might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you. In
      addition, you gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks.</p>
