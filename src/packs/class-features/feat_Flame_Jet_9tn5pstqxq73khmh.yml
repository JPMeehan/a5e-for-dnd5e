    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you shoot a burst of flame behind you and propel yourself
      up to 60 ft in a straight line; moving upwards costs twice as much
      movement. If you end your turn mid-air, you fall at the end of your next
      turn if you do not use this action again; you can also use flame jet as
      part of a&nbsp;<em>fire blast</em> attack, but it propels you in the
      opposite direction from which you attacked.</p>
