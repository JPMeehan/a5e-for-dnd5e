      <p>At 6th level, you’ve developed an impressive expertise in spells of
      your chosen school. Choose one of the following benefits:
      </p><h3><strong>Arcane Armor </strong></h3><p>When you cast a wizard spell
      of 1st-level or higher, you store some of its magic to protect yourself,
      gaining temporary hit points equal to twice the level of the spell, or
      three times the spell’s level if the spell is from your chosen school.
      Instead of gaining these temporary hit points yourself, you can use your
      reaction to grant them to a creature within 30 feet. </p>
