      3rd level, you have become adept at guiding others across uncharted
      regions. You gain proficiency with navigator&rsquo;s tools,
      cartographer&rsquo;s tools, and one type of vehicle of your choice. If you
      are already proficient in any of these tools, you instead gain an
      expertise die. In addition, you gain the Guide exploration knack, or
      another exploration knack if you already have it. This does not count
      against your total exploration knacks known.</span></p>
