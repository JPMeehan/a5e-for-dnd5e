      <p>You’ve won more battles armed with a sextant and your keen intellect
      than you have any blade. You gain proficiency with navigator’s tools, or
      if you are already proficient, an expertise die on checks made using them.
      When determining the distance you travel while journeying, you can make a
      DC 10 navigator’s tools check to travel an additional number of miles
      equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
