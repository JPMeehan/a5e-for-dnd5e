      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to touch one willing
      creature (or yourself) and choose one of the following
      effects.</p><p><strong>All In.</strong> <em>The target gains advantage on
      its next weapon attack, and deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a
      hit.</em></p><p><strong>Iron Will.</strong> <em>For the next minute, as
      long as you are conscious the target gains advantage on Wisdom saving
      throws made against spells and other magical
      effects.</em></p><p><strong>Walk It Off.</strong> <em>One spell or
      condition affecting the target ends.</em></p><p>Once you have used this
      feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, you cannot do
      so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
