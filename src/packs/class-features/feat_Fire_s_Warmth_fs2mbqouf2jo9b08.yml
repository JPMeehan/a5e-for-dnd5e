      <p dir="ltr">Fire is the element of destruction, but it is also an element
      of nurturing warmth. You gain proficiency in Persuasion. If you are
      already proficient in it, you instead gain an expertise die. Additionally,
      allies within 30 feet of you gain an expertise die on their saving throws
      against the Frightened condition, as your presence boosts confidence.</p>
