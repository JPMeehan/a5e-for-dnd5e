      <p>Also at 4th level, at the end of another&nbsp;creature&rsquo;s turn,
      you can use your reaction to&nbsp;activate a battle hymn. This battle
      hymn&nbsp;replaces any currently activated battle&nbsp;hymns. Replacing an
      activated battle hymn&nbsp;does not require expending a use of
      Bardic&nbsp;Inspiration if the previously activated
      hymn&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have a target.&nbsp;In addition, choose one of the
      following.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Your battle hymns don&rsquo;t require&nbsp;concentration.</li>

      <li>Your battle hymns can affect a&nbsp;number of additional creatures
      equal&nbsp;to your Charisma modifier (minimum&nbsp;one).</li>

      <li>You learn an additional battle hymn, which doesn&rsquo;t count against
      the number of battle hymns you know. When choosing this battle hymn, treat
      your bard level as four higher for the purposes of meeting the
      hymn&rsquo;s prerequisites. If you change this Battle Hymn Focus, you
      forget&nbsp;the additional battle hymn.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Whenever you gain a bard level, you can&nbsp;change your Battle Hymn
      Focus.</p>
