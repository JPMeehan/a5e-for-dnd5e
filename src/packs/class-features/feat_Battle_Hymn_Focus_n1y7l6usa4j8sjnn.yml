      <p>Also at 4th level, as soon as battle commences your mind focuses on
      inspiring your allies. At the end of another creature's turn, you can use
      your reaction to activate a battle hymn. This battle hymn replaces any
      currently activated battle hymns. Replacing an activated battle hymn does
      not require expending a use of Bardic Inspiration if it has no target yet.
      </p><p>In addition, choose one of the following. </p><p>· Your battle
      hymns no longer require concentration. </p><p>· Your battle hymns can
      affect a number of additional creatures equal to your Charisma modifier
      (minimum 1). </p><p>· You learn an additional battle hymn that does not
      count against the number of battle hymns you can know. When choosing this
      battle hymn, you are treated as having 4 more bard levels for the purpose
      of meeting its prerequisites. If you change this Battle Hymn Focus, you
      forget the additional battle hymn. </p><p>Whenever you gain a bard level,
      you may change your Battle Hymn Focus.</p>
