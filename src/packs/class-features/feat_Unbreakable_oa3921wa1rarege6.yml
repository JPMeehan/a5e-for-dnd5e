      <p>If you would be reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright,
      you instead drop to 1 hit point and may use your reaction to make a single
      weapon attack against the source of the damage that felled you. If this
      counterattack is a critical hit, you immediately heal to half of your
      maximum hit points. Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again
      until you finish a long rest.</p>
