      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you may use your Channel Divinity to briefly
      look through the eyes of another. While doing so, you are blind to your
      own surroundings and see through the eyes of a creature you name. As long
      as the creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, you recall a
      still image of its surroundings exactly as it saw them in a single moment.
      If the creature is dead, blinded, unconscious, or protected from
      divination magic this feature has no effect.</p>
