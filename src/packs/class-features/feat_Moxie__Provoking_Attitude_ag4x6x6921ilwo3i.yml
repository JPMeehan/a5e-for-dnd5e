      <p>You know how to piss people off. You can expend one use of Rage and
      choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear or see you. The creature
      makes a Charisma saving throw against your Furious Critical DC. On a
      failure, it makes or accepts a challenge. The nature of this challenge is
      at the Narratorâ€™s discretion but is usually a duel or opposed check:
      archery with Dexterity,&nbsp;arm-wrestling with Strength, competing with a
      gaming set, distance running with Constitution, wrestling with Athletics,
      and so on.</p>
