      <p>Also at 3rd level, the ways of combat that have come naturally to you
      bring new and unexpected lessons. Choose one of the following.</p>

      <h2>Agitate</h2>

      <p>Many battles have taught you how to spot aggressive body language like
      a pursed eyebrow, tensed temple, or protruding vein, and you&rsquo;ve
      mastered using these cues to unsettle others outside of combat. Make an
      Intimidation check opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see
      and hear within 20 feet. On a success, you subtly press the creature to
      act out. What exactly the creature does&mdash;back away quickly, blurt out
      something compromising, draw a weapon, look towards a concealed or
      disguised companion, protectively touch something it is carrying&mdash;is
      at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion.</p>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h2>Fearsome Reputation</h2>

      <p>Word spreads of your prodigious strength or how terrifying you can be
      in battle. Whenever you are in a settlement, at least one commoner
      approaches you with a modest gift or bribe and beseeches you to help
      settle a feud, move a large obstacle, or otherwise make use of your
      impressive might. In addition to their offering, they are eager to tell
      you about their home and neighbors.</p>

      <h2>Imposing Prowess</h2>

      <p>When an ally you can see and hear makes a Deception or Persuasion
      check, you can use your reaction to support them with an intimidating
      display of strength or unsettling glower. Your ally rerolls the check,
      gaining an expertise die on the roll.</p>
