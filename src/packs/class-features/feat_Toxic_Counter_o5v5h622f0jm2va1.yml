      <p>At 10th level, you learn to poison the magic of others, harming them
      and disrupting their spells. You learn counterspell if you do not already
      know it. When you cast counterspell, if you successfully disrupt a spell,
      you may also spend a dose of advanced poison as an optional material
      component to deal 3d6 poison damage to the creature whose spell you
      disrupted and it cannot attempt to cast a different spell. </p>
