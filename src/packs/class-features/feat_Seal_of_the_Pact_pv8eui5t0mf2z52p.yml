      <p>At 1st level you can draw upon the magic of genies. Choose the type of
      genie you draw your power from and associated damage type: Div
      (bludgeoning), Djinn (lightning), Efreet (fire), or Marid (cold). You gain
      one of the following:</p>

      <h2>Genie Magic</h2>

      <p>You learn the detect magic spell. At 3rd level you learn the alter self
      spell, at 5th level you learn the tongues spell, and at 9th level you
      learn the creation and conjure elemental spells, the latter of which can
      only summon elementals of the same element and the genie type you chose.
      These spells do not count against your maximum spells known.</p>

      <h2>Genie's Curse</h2>

      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>

      <p>The curse has the following effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an
      additional 1d4. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at
      15th and 20th level. The damage is the damage type associated with the
      type of genie you chose.</li>

      <li>When a cursed target dies, your patron grants you a minor wish,
      restoring proficiency bonus spell points.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
