    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, you can exude fearsomeness in a way that unsettles even
      the courageous. As a bonus action, you can choose to exude menace. For the
      next minute, creatures that are not already friendly to you that see you
      must make a Wisdom save against your passive spell save DC. Creatures that
      fail this saving throw are daunted by your fearsome aspect.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>A daunted creature acts in various ways depending on the situation and
      the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion. Most non-hostile daunted creatures simply
      find somewhere else to be. Hostile daunted creatures might also excuse
      themselves (often making a show of bravado before doing so). A daunted
      creature that attacks you takes a -1d4 penalty to their attack
      rolls.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>A creature engaged in combat with you can re-attempt their save against
      this effect at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a
      success. Creatures not in combat with you can retry the save every hour. A
      creature that successfully saves against this effect gains immunity to it
      for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Creatures that are immune to fear are also immune to your Menacing
      Countenance, as are creatures more than one size larger than you or
      creatures with a CR higher than half of your herald level. Once you have
      used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you
      can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
