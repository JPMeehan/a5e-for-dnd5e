      <p>Also at 7th level, you become the master of causing terror in your
      enemies. You can use this feature to cast<em> fear</em> without using a
      spell slot. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to
      half your proficiency bonus, you may not do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
