      expertise die on checks using a disguise kit increases to 1d10. In
      addition, you have a special inexperienced follower called a Body Double
      who looks identical to you and who can attend public gatherings in your
      stead, providing you a valuable alibi and acting as a decoy. If your Body
      Double dies, you can hire a new one for 500 gp, though you may only have
      one Body Double at a time. This follower does not count against your
      normal limit. </span></p>
