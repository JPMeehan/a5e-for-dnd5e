      <p dir="ltr">While raging you can choose a number of creatures equal to
      your proficiency bonus. You gain the benefits of the telepathic bond spell
      with them.</p><p dir="ltr">Creatures bonded in this way can choose to give
      in to the rage. If they do so, for the duration of your rage they have
      advantage on strength checks and strength saving throws, cannot benefit
      from temporary hit points, gain two rage hit points per round as if they
      were raging to a maximum of 2 x your berserker level, and cannot cast
      spells, concentrate on spells, or use the fallback action.</p><p
      dir="ltr">When using Raging Projection you grant such creatures additional
      rage hit points rather than temporary hit points.</p>
