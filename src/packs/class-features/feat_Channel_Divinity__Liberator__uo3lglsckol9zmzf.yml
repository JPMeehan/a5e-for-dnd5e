      <p>When you choose this archetype, you gain the following two Channel
      Divinity options.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chainbreaker<em>. </em></strong>As
      an action you can destroy all non-magical restraints in a 30 foot radius
      of yourself. Chains shatter, ropes untie, shackles break, cell doors
      crumble into rotted heaps, window bars snap off, etc. None of the
      restraints destroyed this way will ever work again, and attempting to
      reuse the materials in new restraints leaves them brittle and easily
      broken.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Mind Clearer.<em> </em></strong>As a
      bonus action, select a number of creatures within 60 feet of you up to
      your proficiency bonus. If a chosen creature is <em>blinded</em>,
      <em>charmed</em>, <em>confused</em>, <em>deafened</em>,
      <em>frightened</em>, <em>paralyzed</em>, <em>slowed</em>, or
      <em>stunned</em>, those conditions immediately end. In addition, if the
      creature is dominated or supernaturally compelled in some way, those
      effects also end.</p></li></ul>
