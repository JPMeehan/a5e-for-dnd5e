      <p>At 14th level, your fiendish physiological traits become more powerful.
      You gain one of the following benefits based on your choice of Hellish
      Physiology</p>

      <h2>Infernal Wings</h2>

      <p>If you selected Dark Wings for Hellish Physiology, your fly speed
      increases to 60 feet. When you are flying, as an action you can cause
      burning embers to fall from your wings to a space below you. These embers
      deal 1d8 fire damage to any creatures in the space beneath you and ignite
      any unattended flammable objects or substances.</p>

      <h2>Tenebrous Claws</h2>

      <p>You seem to swallow the light around you, decreasing the ambient light
      level by 1 step (from bright light to dim light, from dim light to
      darkness, and from darkness to magical darkness). You can suppress this
      darkness at will (no action required). Your claws now deal an additional
      1d6 points of necrotic damage if you are in darkness or magical
      darkness.</p>
