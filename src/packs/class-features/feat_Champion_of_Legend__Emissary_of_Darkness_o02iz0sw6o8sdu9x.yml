      <p>You gain the Evil alignment trait. You can use an action to call upon
      your deity and emit an aura of magical darkness. For 1 minute, magical
      darkness fills the area around you in a 30-foot radius. You and a number
      of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier can see in this darkness as
      if it were dim light. When a hostile creature starts its turn in your aura
      or first enters into your aura on a turn, it takes necrotic damage equal
      to 10 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
