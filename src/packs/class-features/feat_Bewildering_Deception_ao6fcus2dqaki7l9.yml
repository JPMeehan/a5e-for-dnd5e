      <p>You gain an expertise die on Deception checks and may always apply your
      spellcasting ability modifier to Deception checks. In addition, any time
      you cast an illusion spell that can be seen through with an Investigation
      check, you may make a Deception check and use either your spell save DC or
      the result of the check as the DC to see through the illusion.</p>
