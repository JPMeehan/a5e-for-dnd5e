      <p>Also at 3rd level you begin tapping into the reputations that lancers
      have in a given region. As a result, choose one of the following options
      to represent your social impact.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dashing
      Rake:</strong> Many a lancer plays the part of the dashing rake, a suave
      and graceful sort occasionally mistaken for a fop. Whenever you attempt to
      make a Persuasion or Deception check you may always use your Strength
      modifier, and gain expertise when you do
      so.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rebellious Streak: </strong>Like most lancers
      you have a reputation for bucking authority and getting the job done, no
      matter what it takes. You gain expertise on Intimidation checks and may
      always use your Strength or Constitution when making
      them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stone Soldier: </strong>Some lancers hold to
      traditions one might find in a palace guard or a monastery, and hold their
      cards close to their chest. Creatures have disadvantage on Insight checks
      made against you. In addition, you gain an expertise die on saving throws
      against being charmed or frightened.</p></li></ul>
