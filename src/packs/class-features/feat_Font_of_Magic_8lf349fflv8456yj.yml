      <p>At 2nd level, you’ve begun to understand the well of power within you
      that you draw from to cast your magics. Up until now, it’s just been
      something abstract, maybe hardly understood, but now you can use it in a
      precise manner to fuel your magics. It grants you a new resource in the
      form of Sorcery Points, as well as a way to use them.</p><h3>Sorcery
      Points</h3><p>You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach
      higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer
      table. You can never have more Sorcery Points than shown on the table for
      your level. You regain all spent Sorcery Points when you finish a long
      rest.</p><h3>Flexible Casting</h3><p>You can use your Sorcery Points to
      gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional
      Sorcery Points.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conversion. </strong>You can transform
      unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot, or vice versa, as a bonus
      action. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell
      slot of a given level, or the value of sacrificing a spell slot for
      Sorcery Points.&nbsp;You cannot convert spells of 6th-level or higher.</p>
