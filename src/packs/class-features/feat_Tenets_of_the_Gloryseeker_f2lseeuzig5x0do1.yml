      <p>All gloryseekers follow similar tenets.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Death or Glory. </strong>You must be willing to put everything
      on the line. A death in glory is better than a life in shame.</li>

      <li><strong>My Name will Live On.</strong> You must craft a legacy for
      yourself, not only performing great deeds but ensuring those deeds are
      known, and your fame will outlive you.</li>

      <li><strong>Beneath You.</strong> Do not sully yourself with mundane and
      ordinary tasks, except where absolutely necessary.</li>

      <li><strong>Eternal Drive.</strong> Never be satisfied, and do not rest on
      your laurels. Always strive to better yourself and seek out new
      accomplishments.</li>

      </ul>
