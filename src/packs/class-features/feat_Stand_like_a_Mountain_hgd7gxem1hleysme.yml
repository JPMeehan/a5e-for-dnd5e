      <p>At 10th level, you learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.22rh6x031cqpcdwc]{Stoneskin} spell
      and add it to your spellbook if you do not already have it. You always
      have it prepared and it doesn't count against your number of spells
      prepared. You do not require concentration when casting stoneskin on
      yourself, and while under the effects of a stoneskin spell you cast you
      gain a +1 bonus to AC and an expertise die on Strength, Dexterity, and
      Constitution saving throws.</p>
