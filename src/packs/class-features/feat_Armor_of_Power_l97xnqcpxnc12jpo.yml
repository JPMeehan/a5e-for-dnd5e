      <p>Your bonded artifact is a suit of armor, outfit, article of clothing,
      or an item that is otherwise worn. While wearing your bonded artifact you
      are magically protected and your armor class equals 10 + your spellcasting
      ability modifier + 2 and increases by +1 at levels 5, 9, 13, and 17. You
      can use a shield and still gain this benefit. In addition, you add the
      spell @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.nlto7z4j14ips45w]{Shield}
      to your list of known wielder spells.</p>
