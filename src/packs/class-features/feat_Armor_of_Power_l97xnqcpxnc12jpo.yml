      <p>Your bonded artifact is a suit of armor, outfit, article of clothing,
      or an item that is otherwise worn. While wearing your bonded artifact you
      are magically protected and your armor class equals 10 + your spellcasting
      ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. You can use a shield and still
      gain this benefit. In addition, you add the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.nlto7z4j14ips45w]{Shield} to
      your list of known wielder spells.</p>
