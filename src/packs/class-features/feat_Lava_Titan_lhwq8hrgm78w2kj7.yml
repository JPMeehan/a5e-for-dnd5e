      <p>Also at 20th level, as an action, you gain the ability to transform
      yourself into a terrifying being of animate lava. The form lasts for 1
      minute. While in this lava form you gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>If you would take fire damage from a source you
      did not create, you instead regain that many hit points. You may only
      regain up to 10 hit points this way per turn, with any excess being
      lost.</p></li><li><p>You grow to large size. Your melee attacks reach an
      additional 5 feet further than normal, and your unarmed strikes and melee
      weapon attacks deal an additional 3d6 points of fire damage. A creature
      hitting you with a melee weapon attack must make a Dexterity saving throw
      against your maneuver DC or be splashed with lava for 2d6 fire
      damage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You gain resistance to nonmagical
      bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p></li><li><p>You gain
      advantage on Intimidate checks.</p></li><li><p>You gain a lava splash
      attack that acts as a ranged weapon attack dealing 4d6 fire damage with a
      range of 30/60 feet.</p></li><li><p>Creatures immune to fire are treated
      as resistant to fire for the purpose of your attacks.</p></li></ul><p
      style="text-align: start">Once you have used this ability, you canâ€™t do so
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>
