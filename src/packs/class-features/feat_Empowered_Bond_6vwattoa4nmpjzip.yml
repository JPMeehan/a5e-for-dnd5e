      <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the <em>find familiar</em> spell and can
      cast it as a ritual. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the
      normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms:
      awakened shrub, shrieker, sprite, or violet fungus. </p><p>Additionally,
      when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to
      allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.</p>
