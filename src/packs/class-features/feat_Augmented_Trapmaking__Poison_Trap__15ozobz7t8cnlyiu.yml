      <p>At 9th level, you invent a new way to increase the danger posed by your
      traps. You learn one of the following trap capabilities. When using
      Trapmaking to create a trap, you can choose to augment it with the new
      capability, which is triggered when your trap damages a
      creature.</p><h3><strong>Poison Trap</strong></h3><p>You may add a contact
      or injury poison to the trap (see Chapter 6: Maladies, in Trials &amp;
      Treasures), which is consumed. The victim of the trap is affected by the
