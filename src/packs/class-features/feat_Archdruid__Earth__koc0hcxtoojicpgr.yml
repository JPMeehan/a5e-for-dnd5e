      <p>You can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no
      matter your form. Once each turn, you can use a bonus action to choose a
      target point within 30 feet and one of the following element options. If
      the element you choose is not present at or near the target point, any
      damage dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your
      spell attack, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to
      resist it.</p><p><strong>Earth. </strong>Clumps of dirt and stone explode
      outward. Creatures within 10 feet of the target point take 4d8 bludgeoning
      damage and are knocked prone. A creature that makes a Strength saving
      throw against your spell save DC takes half damage is not knocked
      prone.</p>
