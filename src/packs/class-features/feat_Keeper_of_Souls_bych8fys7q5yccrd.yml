      <p dir="ltr">At 14th level you have learned how to use an item (for
      example a book, a lantern, or a crystal) of your own creation, or one
      gifted to you, to imprison the souls of those that have recently passed,
      harnessing their power for your own gain&hellip; or as a gift to your
      Patron.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When a living creature dies within 60ft of
      you, you may use a reaction to capture its soul.</p><p dir="ltr">You may
      use an action to sacrifice a soul to target a pile of bones or a corpse.
      Doing so animates a Skeletal Champion or Zombie Knight, as appropriate.
      You may have a number of these undead under your control at any one time
      equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><p dir="ltr">The undead all share the
      same turn, rolling initiative once. While they are within 60 feet, you can
      use a bonus action to mentally command the undead (they all follow the
      same command). You may choose the action the undead take and where they
      move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as
      guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defend
      themselves. The undead continue to follow a command until its task is
      complete.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The undead are under your control for 24
      hours, after which they crumble to dust, unless you sacrifice another
      number of souls to maintain the undead, and your control over them.</p>
