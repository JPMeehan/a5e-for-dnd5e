      <p>At 13th level, you gain greater control of your elemental affinities.
      The range of your Control Elements ability increases to 60 feet. You can
      now perform the following effects as an action, or sustain an effect from
      the previous round as an action.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can move elemental material weighing up to 50 lbs per elementalist
      level. You can move multiple objects together, as long as they weigh less
      than your total limit together and fit within a 15 by 15 foot cube.</li>

      <li>You can target an elemental creature within range that is no larger
      than Huge size. The target makes a Strength save against your spell save
      DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and is restrained (even in
      mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond
      your 60 foot control range, or else it is released from your hold.</li>

      <li>Air can be used to push creatures of up to Huge size. Choose a
      creature within range. The target makes a Strength save against your spell
      DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and is knocked prone.
      Swirling winds can be used to manipulate light objects weighing less than
      5 lbs per elementalist level, moving them up to 30 feet, but this movement
      is not precise.</li>

      <li>Earth can be used to grab creatures of up to Huge size. Choose a
      creature within range. The target makes a Strength save against your spell
      DC or is restrained until it breaks free. It can turn 15 by 15 foot
      sections of stone or earth ground into difficult terrain.</li>

      <li>Fire can be used to move or expand fires. A 15 by 15 foot cube portion
      of fire, or a fire that fits within the area, can be moved up to 30 feet,
      or a fire can be expanded by a 15 by 15 foot portion. If there is no fuel
      present in the new area, the fire burns as long as you spend an action
      each round to maintain it. While you maintain it, the fire&rsquo;s damage
      increases to 1d6 times your Elemental Blast dice; otherwise it uses the
      fire&rsquo;s own damage dice. A 15 by 15 foot section of fire, or other
      hot material such as lava, can be cooled to ambient temperature, by moving
      the heat away from it, snuffing out fires and cooling portions of lava
      into stone.</li>

      <li>Water can be used to make 15 by 15 ft sections of ground slick.
      Creatures that attempt to move at full speed through the area must make a
      Dexterity save against your spell save DC or fall prone. Water can also be
      used to make waves to push a target creature of up to Huge size within
      range of you and the source of water. The target makes a Strength save
      against your spell DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction away from
      the water.</li>

      <li>You can use control element to finely manipulate objects made of
      elemental material that you have Affinity with, like opening a stone door,
      or moving ink to write without a pen.</li>
