      <p>At 14th level, you&rsquo;ve reached the pinnacle of your chosen magics.
      Choose one of the following benefits:</p>

      <h2>Battle Hardiness</h2>

      <p>When concentrating on a wizard spell from your chosen school, you
      reduce incoming bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage by an amount
      equal to the level of the spell.</p>

      <h2>Heightened Potency</h2>

      <p>When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, it is always
      treated as though it were cast with a spell slot one level higher (maximum
      9th-level) than the one you used, so long as you expended a spell slot to
      cast it. The slot you use to cast the spell must still be at least equal
      to the level of the spell.</p>

      <h2>Precise Understanding</h2>

      <p>When you see a creature cast a spell from your chosen school, you
      automatically know what spell it&rsquo;s casting. You also have advantage
      on saving throws against spells.</p>
