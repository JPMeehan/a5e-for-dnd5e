      <p>At 15th level you’ve beaten death—mostly. You gain the
      <em>resurrection</em> spell and when you prepare your artificer spells you
      can prepare it and create a spell invention for it (or forgo it for a
      modification) in addition to your normal number of prepared spells. This
      spell counts as a 5th-level artificer spell for you and you can cast it
      without the usual material components, but a creature you target with it
      gains the monstrosity type and cannot be targeted by this feature
      again.</p>
