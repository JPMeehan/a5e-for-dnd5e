      <p>At 15th level you&rsquo;ve beaten death&mdash;mostly. You gain the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.zontlhypt3b5gk6z]{Resurrection}
      spell and when you prepare your artificer spells you can prepare it and
      create a spell invention for it (or forgo it for a modification) in
      addition to your normal number of prepared spells. This spell counts as a
      5th-level artificer spell for you and you can cast it without the usual
      material components, but a creature you target with it gains the
      monstrosity type and cannot be targeted by this feature again.</p>
