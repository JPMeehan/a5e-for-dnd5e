      at 3rd level, you have a knack for seeming to be other than you are. You
      have advantage on Deception and Performance checks made when attempting to
      mimic another creature&rsquo;s looks, mannerisms, or speech.</span></p>

      <p id="docs-internal-guid-2d98543a-7fff-9538-676b-500fa5d05fce"
      dir="ltr">In addition, you have a natural talent for perfectly mimicking
      the sounds of other creatures you&rsquo;ve heard make sound for at least 1
      minute. A suspicious listener can see through your perfect mimicry by
      succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma
      (Deception/Performance) check.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Likewise, you can perfectly copy the signatures and
      penmanship of a creature if you have studied a sample of it for at least 1
      minute. A suspicious reader can identify such forgeries by succeeding on
      an Intelligence (Investigation) check opposed by your Dexterity (forgery
      kit) check.</p>
