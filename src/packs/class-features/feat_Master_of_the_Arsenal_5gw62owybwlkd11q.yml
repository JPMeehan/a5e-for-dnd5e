      <p>At 18th level you finally achieve a taste of the perfection you crave.
      You are proficient with all weapons, armor, and shields, and if you
      encounter a weapon you have never seen before (such as one from a level of
      technology different from your own), after a minute of practice, you are
      proficient with it. In addition, at the beginning of your turn, you may
      grant a weapon you are wielding one of the following properties until the
      beginning of your next turn: <em>breaker, compounding, defensive (any),
      parrying, parrying immunity, thrown, vicious</em>.</p>
