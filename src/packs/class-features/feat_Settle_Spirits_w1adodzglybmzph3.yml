      dir="ltr">At 6th level, you have a knack for de-escalating conflict. You
      learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.hnvt4tnuww6o4vvi]{Calm
      Emotions} spell, or another bard spell if you already know it. When you
      cast this spell, it affects all creature types except for constructs and
      undead, although at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion it may affect undead
      who are driven by strong emotions such as revenants and wraiths.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, when you affect a creature with this spell, you
      may choose to suppress one level of strife or the confused condition for
      the duration of the spell.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Finally, for you, calm emotions gains a duration of 10
      minutes, and you gain advantage on Persuasion and Insight checks against
      creatures whose hostile emotions are being suppressed by the spell. At the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may be able to prevent hostile emotions
      from resuming after the spell&rsquo;s duration by speaking with creatures
      affected this way.</p>
