      dir="ltr">At 6th level, you have a knack for de-escalating conflict. You
      learn the calm emotions spell, or another bard spell if you already know
      it. When you cast this spell, it affects all creature types except for
      constructs and undead, although at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion it may
      affect undead who are driven by strong emotions such as revenants and
      wraiths.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, when you affect a creature with this spell, you
      may choose to suppress one level of strife or the confused condition for
      the duration of the spell.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Finally, for you, calm emotions gains a duration of 10
      minutes, and you gain advantage on Persuasion and Insight checks against
      creatures whose hostile emotions are being suppressed by the spell. At the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may be able to prevent hostile emotions
      from resuming after the spell&rsquo;s duration by speaking with creatures
      affected this way.</p>
