      <p>Choose a creature type from fiend, fey, celestial, elemental, or
      undead. You know when a creature of this type is within 60 feet of you,
      although you do not know its location. <em>Nondetection</em> protects
      against this feature. You may select this sign multiple times, choosing a
      different creature type each time.</p>
