      <p>At 7th level, your knowledge of the natural world grows. Choose one of
      the following:</p><h3><strong>DRUIDIC SECRETS</strong></h3><p>You’re adept
      at covertly performing druidic magic without attracting attention. When
      you cast a druid spell you may choose to do so utilizing silent and subtle
      Druidic motions and signs in place of both the spell’s seen and vocalized
      components, gestures that creatures which can speak Druidic are aware of.
      Once you cast a druid spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p><h3><strong>TOXIN
      INTUITION</strong></h3><p>You are a veteran of nature’s chemical warfare.
      You automatically know if any flora or fauna is poisonous or venomous. In
      addition, you gain advantage on checks made to determine if a foodstuff is
      poisonous and saving throws against
      poison.</p><h3><strong>TRUTHSPEAKER</strong></h3><p>You’ve learned to tap
      into the fundamental truth that connects all things, at least
      briefly.</p><p>You may cast the spell legend lore without expending a
      spell slot and without material components. Once you cast the spell in
      this way, you cannot do so again for the next 24
      hours.</p><h3><strong>WASTE NOT</strong></h3><p>With 10 minutes work you
      can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of a beast, dragon,
      monstrosity, or plant that has a CR of 1 or higher and has died within the
      last hour. If sold to a collector, naturalist, or other druid, this
      notable component is worth an amount of gold equal to 5 × the creature’s
      CR.</p>
