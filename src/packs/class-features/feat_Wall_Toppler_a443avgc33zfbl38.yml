      <p>You gain a burrow speed equal to your walking speed, and may tunnel
      directly through worked stone as if it were ordinary earth. You always
      leave a tunnel behind you as you go. This ability is supernatural and does
      not require you to have your hands free. Liberators are fond of using this
      ability to undermine the walls of prisons and strongholds belonging to
      tyrants.</p>
