      <p>At 6th level, you have developed knew skills for defending yourself as
      you explore and study a hostile and dangerous world. Choose one of the
      following options:</p><h2>Mystic Apprentice</h2><p>While you are not truly
      a magic user per se, you have come to appreciate the usefulness of some
      minor magical talents for defending oneself, especially as an alternative
      to physical combat. You learn two cantrips of your choice from any spell
      list. Both cantrips must be from the same list, and at least one of them
      must deal damage. Unlike most scholar abilities, these are actual spells
      that follow the normal rules for spellcasting.</p><h2>Precision
      Strikes</h2><p>You have learned how to apply your knowledge and powers of
      observation to harming others. You may spend a bonus action to study a
      target. Any time you hit that target with a weapon attack before the end
      of your next turn, you deal an additional 1d8 damage to them of the same
      type as the attack. In addition, for the duration you may apply your
      Intelligence modifier to hit and damage with weapon attacks against this
      target instead of Strength or Dexterity. The bonus damage increases to
      1d10 at 9th level, 1d12 at 14th level, and 2d8 at 18th level.</p>
