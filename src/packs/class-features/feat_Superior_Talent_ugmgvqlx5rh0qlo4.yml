      <p>At 10th level, you&rsquo;ve discovered even greater ways to use your
      magic to your advantage. Choose one of the following benefits:</p>

      <h2>Perfect Control</h2>

      <p>When concentrating on a wizard spell of your chosen school, you only
      need to roll to maintain concentration when you take damage from an
      attack, effect, or spell equal to or greater than your Intelligence score
      + your wizard level.</p>

      <h2>Secondary Learning</h2>

      <p>Choose a second school to count as your Scholarly Specialty, and an
      additional feature from either Esoteric Talent or Refined Learning.</p>

      <h2>Splinter Spell</h2>

      <p>When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school that only affects
      one creature, you can have it affect an additional creature within range.
      Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>
