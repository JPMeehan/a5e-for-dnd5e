      <p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to wild shape into a special raven
      form that does not count against your wild shapes known. This special form
      has a few advantages over a normal raven form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>You can speak either in your normal voice or a raven&rsquo;s squawking
      voice as you see fit. You also can communicate telepathically within 100
      feet.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>While you are in raven form, you may cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.jo2vztvypvhqxh5u]{Dream} spell
      once. This locks you into your raven form until the spell ends, and you
      must be the messenger. You appear to the target as your raven form, but
      you may choose to have the target know your identity if you wish.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Your flight speed is 120 feet rather than the normal 50-foot speed of a
      raven.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Instead of a raven&rsquo;s normal beak attack, you have an improved
      one. Your to-hit modifier is the sum of your Wisdom bonus and Proficiency
      bonus, and the attack deals 1d4 piercing + your choice of radiant or
      necrotic damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>If raven was already one of your wild shape forms, you may select
      another one to replace it when you gain access to this feature.&nbsp;</p>
