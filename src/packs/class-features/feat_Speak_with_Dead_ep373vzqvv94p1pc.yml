      <p>Also at 2nd level you gain the ability to speak with the dead. You can
      cast the 3rd-level spell&nbsp;<em>speak with dead</em><em>&nbsp;</em>as an
      action without expending any spell slots. Once you have used this feature,
      you cannot do so again until after you take a&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">long rest</span>&nbsp;.</p>

      <p>At 10th level you gain the ability to use this feature a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus between long rests.</p>
