      <p>An orderly mind can see all sorts of uses within the natural world. You
      may use Engineering in place of Survival when setting up camp or
      performing the Gather Components journey activity. In addition, you may
      use the material components gained from the Gather Components journey
      activity for your spell inventions and other artificer features that
      require material components.</p>
