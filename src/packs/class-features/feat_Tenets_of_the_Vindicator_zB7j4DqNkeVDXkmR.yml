      <p>All Vindicators hold similar tenets, regardless of any deity they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Fairness. </strong>Your actions should not be influenced by
      partiality or animosity.</li>

      <li><strong>Persistence.</strong> Once you have determined the proper
      course of action, see it through.</li>

      <li><strong>Resolution. </strong>Do not allow yourself to be corrupted or
      swayed from what is right.</li>

      <li><strong>Resilience.</strong> You will witness terrible wickedness as
      you strive to bring it down. Steel yourself, and seek help when
      needed.</li>

      <li><strong>Restraint.</strong> Your job is justice, not vengeance.
      Wherever possible, leave punishment to the courts. Where that is not
      possible, let the punishment fit the crime.</li>

      </ul>
