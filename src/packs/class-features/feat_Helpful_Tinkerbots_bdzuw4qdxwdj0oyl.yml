      dir="ltr">Starting at 5th level you&rsquo;ve developed the habit of
      creating countless tiny little machines that scurry and hover about your
      person like little pets, sometimes they can even be helpful. As a bonus
      action, you can perform the Help action using a tiny tinkerbot that you
      found a use for. You can perform the Help action in this way a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all spent uses
      whenever you finish a long rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">In addition,
      you can create mechanical versions of creatures with the Beast creature
      type of CR 0 using Tactical Chemistry by spending 10 gp worth of
      mechanical components in addition to a use of your Tactical Chemistry
      feature. Creatures you create in this way instead have the Construct
      creature type instead of any other creature types, and will follow the
      first order you give them upon their creation to the best of their
      abilities. After which they will behave normally as if they were real
      creatures. Mechanical creatures you create in this way power down and fall
      apart after 1 hour but otherwise remain until destroyed.</p>
