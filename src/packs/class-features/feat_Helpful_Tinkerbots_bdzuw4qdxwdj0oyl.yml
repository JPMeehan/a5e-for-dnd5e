      dir="ltr">Starting at 5th level you&rsquo;ve developed the habit of
      creating countless tiny little machines that scurry and hover about your
      person like little pets, sometimes they can even be helpful. As a bonus
      action, you can perform the Help action using a tiny tinkerbot that you
      found a use for. You can perform the Help action in this way a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all spent uses
      whenever you finish a long rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you can create mechanical versions of creatures
      with the Beast creature type of CR 0 using
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.f2syblzgm6at7i7q]{Tactical
      Chemistry} by spending 10 gp worth of mechanical components in addition to
      a use of your Tactical Chemistry feature. Creatures you create in this way
      instead have the Construct creature type instead of any other creature
      types, and will follow the first order you give them upon their creation
      to the best of their abilities. After which they will behave normally as
      if they were real creatures. Mechanical creatures you create in this way
      power down and fall apart after 1 hour but otherwise remain until
      destroyed.</p>
