      <p>Also at 1st level, your clerical vocation anoints you with certain
      graces for spreading your message to the people. Choose one of the
      following:</p><h2>Clerical Charisma</h2><p>Crowds find your public
      presence irresistible. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill.
      Whenever you use Performance to deliver a sermon or to sing holy songs in
      a town or city, even on a failed check other than a natural 1, you still
      attract a crowd of people no smaller than your spell save
      DC.</p><h2>Ordination</h2><p>Your mission in the world is supported by the
      spiritual community or religious hierarchy who called you to religious
      service. As a formal leader within your religious order, you are expected
      to perform the ceremonies of your faith, including weddings and funerals.
      In exchange, members of your faith provide you and your companions with
      food, lodging, and a modest lifestyle.</p><p>Additionally, if your
      congregation or order is able, they send you letters with regular updates
      about their well-being. They are willing to help connect you with other
      chapters of your faith through letters of introduction.</p><h2>Zeal of the
      Convert</h2><p>You enthusiastically see the hand of a greater entity
      everywhere. You gain advantage on Persuasion checks when you invoke the
      name of your deity or movement during a conversation with a pious person.
      If the listener is negatively disposed to your greater entity or movement,
      you have disadvantage instead.</p>
