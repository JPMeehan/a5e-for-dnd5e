      <p>All liberators hold similar tenets, regardless of any master they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Break Chains. </strong>Whether literal or metaphorical, free
      the innocent from the things that imprison them.</li>

      <li><strong>Destroy Oppression. </strong>Individual agents of oppression
      may be shown mercy, but oppressive leaders and systems may not. Tear down
      cruelty and corruption wherever you can find it. Destroy them utterly, and
      do not allow new oppressors to take their place.</li>

      <li><strong>Pragmatism. </strong>Don&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy
      of the good. Sometimes compromises must be made for the sake of the
      greater good.</li>

      <li><strong>Equality.</strong> Freedom is for everyone, not just a select
      group of people. The only exceptions are those who would use their own
      freedom to deny it to others.</li>

      <li><strong>Justice. </strong>Brutal chaos where the strong dominate the
      weak is no freedom at all.</li>

      </ul>
