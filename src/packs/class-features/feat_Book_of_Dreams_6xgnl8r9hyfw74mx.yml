      <p>You may select one ritual spell on your spell list and add it to a
      dream journal. Once per long rest while sleeping or trancing, you may
      ritually cast one of the spells in your journal. Each time you gain a
      witch level, you may add another ritual spell you know to the list. In
      addition, you always have the dream spell prepared, it does not count
      against the number of prepared spells, and you may ritually cast it even
      though it does not have the ritual tag, but only while you are sleeping or
      trancing.</p>
