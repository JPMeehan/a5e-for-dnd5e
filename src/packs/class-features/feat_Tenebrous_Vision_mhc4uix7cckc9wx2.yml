      <p>At 3rd level, you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you
      already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet instead.</p><p>At
      level 6 your darkvision can penetrate magical darkness.</p><p>At level 18
      darkness, no matter how deep, does nothing to impede your vision. You
      treat dim light, darkness, and magical darkness as bright light and can
      read, distinguish colors and so on as normal even with no light
      available.</p>
