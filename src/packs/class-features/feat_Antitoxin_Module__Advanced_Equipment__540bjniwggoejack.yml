      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The automaton gains three charges which
      stack with the ones from Autonomous Medic (if applicable). It can spend a
      charge to neutralize one poison with a DC of 15 or lower in a creature it
      can touch. It regains all spent charges when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
