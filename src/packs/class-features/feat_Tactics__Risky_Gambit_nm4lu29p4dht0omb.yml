    value: >-
      <p>You can use a bonus action to choose one creature within range of your
      Commanding Presence. The target immediately provokes an opportunity attack
      from one creature that can reach it. If the creature makes the attack,
      that creature grants advantage on all attack rolls made against it until
      the start of your next turn.</p>
