      <p>At 17th level you can use the Stunning Strike and Paralyzing Strike
      focus features with ranged weapon attacks. If you do not already possess
      both of these focus features, you gain one of them, which does not count
      against your number of focus features known. If you already possess both
      of them, you learn a different focus feature of your choice.</p>
