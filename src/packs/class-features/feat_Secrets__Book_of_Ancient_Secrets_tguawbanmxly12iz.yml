      <p><em>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</em></p><p>The complex
      sigils and symbols of ritual magic appear in your Book of Shadows. Choose
      two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag. The spells appear in the
      book and don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you know. While
      the book is in your possession, you can cast these spells as rituals. You
      can&rsquo;t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you&rsquo;ve learned
      them by some other means. You&nbsp;can also cast a warlock spell you know
      as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p><p>When you find a spell with the
      ritual tag, you can transcribe it into your Book of Shadows if the
      spell&rsquo;s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level
      (rounded up). For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes
      2 hours and costs 50 gold for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p>
