    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level your divine smites deal an additional 1d8 damage against
      any creature turned by your Turn the Outsider ability. Whenever you kill
      or banish such a creature, you may regain a use of your divine smite. Once
      you have regained a number of divine smites in this fashion equal to your
      Charisma modifier you may not do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
