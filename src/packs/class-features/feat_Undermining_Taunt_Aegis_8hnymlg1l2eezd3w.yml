      <p>When a creature misses with an attack or when a foe succeeds on a
      saving throw against an effect it created, you can use your reaction to
      capitalize on their failure, warning the creature why another possible
      course of action will also turn out badly. If that creature can understand
      you, choose an action, such as Attack or Cast a Spell. The target must
      make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, until the end of its next turn
      it cannot take that action.</p>
