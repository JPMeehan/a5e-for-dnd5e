      <p>At 5th level, you have developed your spellcasting skill and honed it
      into spells that you consider to be your Signature Spells.</p><p>Choose
      one 1st-level wizard spell that is in your spellbook. You always have this
      spell prepared, it doesn&rsquo;t count toward your maximum prepared
      spells, and you can cast this spell at its lowest level without expending
      a spell slot.&nbsp;Once you have cast a Signature Spell in this way, you
      must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.</p><p>At
      higher levels, you gain additional Signature Spells, each of which you can
      cast once between rests. At 11th level, you can choose one 2nd-level
      Signature Spell. At 17th level, you can choose one 3rd-level Signature
      Spell. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of
      your Signature Spells with another of the same level.</p>
