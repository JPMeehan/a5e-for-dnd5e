      <p>At 6th level your outpouring of natural power begins manifesting in new
      ways.</p><h3><strong>Verdant Beauty</strong></h3><p>Colorful patterns and
      petals grow across your body. You gain proficiency with Deception and
      Persuasion. If you already have proficiency with either of these skills,
      you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you can use an action to
      emit charming spores at a target within 30 feet as per the spell
      <strong>Charm Person</strong>. Creatures that are immune to the poisoned
      condition are unaffected by these spores. </p><p>You may emit spores in
      this way number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain
      all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
