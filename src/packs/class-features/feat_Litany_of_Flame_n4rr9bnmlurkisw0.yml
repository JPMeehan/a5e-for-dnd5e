      <p dir="ltr">At 14th level, you learn the Litany of Flame. To use it, you
      must spend a use of your Wild Shape and an action. Once it has begun, you
      must concentrate on it like a spell, and you may keep it active for up to
      10 minutes. While the Litany of Flame is active you gain the following
      effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You continuously chant the Litany,
      precluding you from casting spells.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain immunity to fire damage.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You shed bright light in a 50-foot radius
      around you and dim light a further 50 feet beyond that. The light is
      considered daylight.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain unlimited use of Brand of
      Flame.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain the benefits of Eyes of
      Flame.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As an action you may cause a creature
      within 30 feet of you to ignite, taking 3d6 fire damage and 1d6 ongoing
      fire damage. A creature may spend an action to put the fire out, ending
      the ongoing damage.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As a bonus action, you may ignite a
      10-foot square into flames. It is affected as per the Fire encounter
      element.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As a reaction, you may cause a creature
      within 60 feet of you whose presence you are aware of to be outlined in
      ghostly flames as if it were affected by
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.z7r6plq6vyesck07]{Faerie Fire}.
      If you stop chanting or lose concentration, the effect ends.</p>

      </li>
