      <p>Tenets of the Green Knight</p><p>All green knights hold similar tenets,
      regardless of the deity they serve.</p><p>• Defend Nature. Protect and
      heal the lands you travel through.</p><p>• Embody Strength. Be as mighty
      as a boulder and when needed stand firm like a rooted tree.</p><p>• Ensure
      the Cycle. Do not suffer that which defies the natural flow of life and
      teach these ways to others.</p><p>• Walk the World. Travel far and
      experience the beauty of nature beyond your territory.</p><p>Archetype
      School</p><p>Add the nature school of magic to your list of herald
      spells.</p>
