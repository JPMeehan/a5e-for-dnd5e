      teachers. You require only half the usual gold and time to perform the
      Research downtime activity. In addition, after speaking with a person for
      at least 1 minute, you can use an action to make either an Insight or
      Arcana check against their passive Deception. On a success, you learn the
      following information about them:</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Which lore skills (Arcana, Culture,
      Engineering, History, Nature, and Religion) they are proficient in, if
      any.</p>
