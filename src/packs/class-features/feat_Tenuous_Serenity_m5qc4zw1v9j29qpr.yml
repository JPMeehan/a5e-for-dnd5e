      <p>At 14th level, you can exert some control over your magics to empower
      yourself. When you make a Charisma saving throw, you can spend 1 sorcery
      point to add an expertise die to the roll, or reroll an expertise die used
      in the roll. You may do this after seeing the result.</p><p>Additionally,
      you can spend time in meditation to attempt to reclaim magics you’ve lost.
      When you finish a short rest, select a spell that’s been removed from your
      spell list by one of your class features. You reclaim the spell. You can’t
      perform this meditation again until you finish a long rest.</p>
