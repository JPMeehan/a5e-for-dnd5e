  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The damage of this smite can bypass the physical form of the creature
      attacked and may be applied directly to another creature sharing its body
      such as a possessing spirit or parasitic creature. </p><p>In addition, the
      target makes a constitution saving throw. If it is not native to the plane
      it currently occupies, it returns to its home plane for one minute, then
      reappears in the space it previously occupied or the nearest available
      safe space if its former space is occupied. </p><p>If the creature fails
      its save by 5 or more, it it banished for a year instead, and is unable to
      return to the plane it was banished from by means less powerful than a
      wish spell. If the creature is undead, it is sent to its final judgment
      instead of being banished for a year.</p>
