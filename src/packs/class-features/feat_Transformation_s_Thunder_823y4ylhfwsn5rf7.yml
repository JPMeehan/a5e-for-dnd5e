      <p>You do not enter your torchbearer form with subtlety, and instead burst
      out with sound and fury. You add the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.65ksar78lxxp7uol]{Thunderwave}
      to your list of known wielder spells. In addition, when you use a bonus
      action to enter your torchbearer form you may choose to cast the spell
      <em>thunderwave </em>at 1st level without expending any additional
      artifact charges as a part of the same bonus action.</p>
