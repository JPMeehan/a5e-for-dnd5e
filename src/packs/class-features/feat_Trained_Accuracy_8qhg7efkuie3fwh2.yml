      <p>At 2nd level, you learn to maintain a level of discipline that spills
      over into everything you do. This perpetual state of focus allows you to
      perform incredible feats.&nbsp;When using Trained Accuracy, the bonus to
      attack rolls from Fighting Style: Archery becomes a +2 bonus to damage on
      ranged weapon attacks.</p>
