      <p>Beginning at 2nd level when you take this archetype, you learn to
      safely harvest and handle toxins. You gain proficiency with the poisonerâ€™s
      kit and on a failed check, you are not poisoned, though you still do not
      collect any poison. You also have some low-level, permanent wards against
      poisonous effects. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and
      effects that would deal poison or necrotic damage to you.</p><p>Finally,
      spells on the Poison list always count as wizard spells for you, and you
      may copy a spell on the Poison list into your spellbook at the normal cost
      for a spell of that level, though other wizards cannot also copy them from
      your spellbook unless it is normally on the wizard spell list.</p>
