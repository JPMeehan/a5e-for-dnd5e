    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You cause the target creature&rsquo;s spell to surge with
      mind-rattling power. When the target creature casts a spell that deals
      damage, you may cause it to reroll all 1s and 2s on the damage dice,
      adding to the total damage rather than replacing the initial rolls.
      Alternatively, when the target creature casts a spell that doesn&rsquo;t
      deal damage and requires a save, you cause its save DC to be increased by
      an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). For the
      next minute, the target is unable to concentrate or cast that same spell
      again.</p>
