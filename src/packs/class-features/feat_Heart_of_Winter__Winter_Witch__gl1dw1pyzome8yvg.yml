      <p>When you select this archetype at 2nd&nbsp;level, you learn the <em>ray
      of frost</em> cantrip if you do not know it already.</p><p>In addition,
      all <em>cold</em> spells count as witch spells for you and whenever you
      cast a <em>cold</em> spell of 1st&nbsp;level or higher, it counts as being
      one spell slot higher than you actually expended, to a maximum of the
      highest level spell slot you posess. In the case of fire shield and
      infernal weapon this benefit only applies when casting the <em>cold</em>
      version.</p>
