      <p>When you take the Dash action and make a long jump after moving no less
      than 20 feet, your jump distance is doubled for the turn. You may spend 1
      exertion to triple your jump distance for the turn instead, and may move
      the full distance of your jump even if it exceeds your Speed.</p>
