      <p>When you select this archetype at 2nd level, your familiar&rsquo;s type
      changes to undead, it gains immunity to cold and necrotic damage and
      resistance to fire, lightning, thunder, and acid damage, as well as damage
      from non-magical weapons.</p><p>Its attacks also deal necrotic damage, and
      once per long rest it can cast <em style="mso-bidi-font-style:
      normal;">speak with dead </em>on your behalf at 3rd level. It appears as a
      ghostly, spectral version of your chosen animal. You also learn the <em
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">chill touch</em> and <em
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">spare the dying</em> cantrips if you
      do not know them already.</p>
