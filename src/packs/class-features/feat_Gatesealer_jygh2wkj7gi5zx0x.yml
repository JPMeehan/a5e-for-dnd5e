      <p>You learn specialized magic usually only entrusted to the servants of
      the gods.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>You add the <em>Dispel Evil and Good</em> and <em>Hallow</em> spells to
      your spellbook.</p>

      <p>You also add the <em>Forbiddance</em> spell at level 11, the <em>Divine
      Ward</em> spell at level 13, and the&nbsp;<em>Antimagic Field</em> spell
      at level 15. None of these spells count against your wizard spell choices
      for their respective levels.</p>

      <p>You also learn the <em>Break Spell</em> maneuver and your exertion pool
      increases by 2 points. If you already know it, you may choose another 2nd-
      or 3rd- degree maneuver from the <em>Tempered Iron</em> school or from
      another combat tradition that utilizes or nullifies magic.</p>

      <p>Finally, you gain advantage on saving throws to avoid taking
      <em>psychic</em> damage or gaining levels of strife from any source but
      your own spells or features.</p>
