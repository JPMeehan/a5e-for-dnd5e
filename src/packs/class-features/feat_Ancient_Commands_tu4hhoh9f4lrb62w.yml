      <p>You have learned secret ancient words and phrases, with the very
      authority of creation, and can use them to command the world around you.
      You may expend a hit die to replicate the effects of the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.bs1zn1s8ewwa4tfx]{Command} spell. In
      addition, once per long rest you may expend a hit die and make a DC 20
      skill check of the appropriate type to execute a more potent short but
      irresistible command. Examples include ordering a hungry pack of wolves
      back to their dens, commanding a hidden and/or magically locked door to
      open, ordering an undead back into its tomb, ordering a pile of logs to
      catch alight, breaking the hold of a cursed magic item, or commanding such
      an item to function in situations it would normally not such as writing
      that only appears under moonlight revealing itself in broad daylight.</p>

      <p>The Narrator is the ultimate arbiter of what effects you can create
      with this, though it should not be able to affect a creature with a CR
      greater than your scholar level. Such commands are extremely taxing,
      however, and grant you a level of fatigue when successfully used.</p>
