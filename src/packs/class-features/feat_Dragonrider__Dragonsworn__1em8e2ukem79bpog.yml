      <p>At 14th level, you gain the services of a draconic mount, either an
      ally you have bonded, a gift from your master, or a creature you have
      broken and bound to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span></p><p>You may cast the <em>find steed</em>&nbsp;spell at 5th level
      without expending spell points once per long rest.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></p><p>The steed you summon always has
      the stats of a giant lizard with the following changes: it is large, has
      an AC of 18, it is immune to your draconic damage type, you must choose to
      give it a fly speed instead of a swim speed, its type is dragon, it uses
      your spell attack bonus for any attacks it makes, and it gains a breath
      weapon action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This breath
      weapon is a 30 foot cone and deals 5d6 damage your draconic damage type on
      a failure or half damage on a success, uses your warlock spell save DC,
      and can only be used once per short or long rest.</p>
