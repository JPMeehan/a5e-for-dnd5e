      <p>You’ve heard and seen (and perhaps told) enough lies that you spot them
      as easily as tells in battle. You can always choose to use Constitution
      for Insight checks and gain an expertise die when rolling to detect a
      falsehood.</p><p>In addition, you are seen as an arbiter of truth by those
      who have heard of your reputation and you may be called in to mediate a
      trial or question a suspected wrong-doer, even in larger settlements.</p>
