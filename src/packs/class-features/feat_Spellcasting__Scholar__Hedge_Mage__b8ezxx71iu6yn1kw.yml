      <p>Also at 3rd level, unlike other scholars, you interweave a study of the
      arcane directly into your greater search for knowledge. You have the
      ability to cast spells, following the normal rules for spellcasting.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Cantrips</h2>

      <p>At 3rd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the wizard
      spell list. These spells count as scholar spells for you. You learn an
      additional cantrip at 10th level.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Spell Slots</h2>

      <p>The Hedge Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have
      to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells,
      you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain
      all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Spells Known of 1st-Level or Higher</h2>

      <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard spell
      list. The Spells Known column of the Hedge Mage Spellcasting table shows
      when you learn more spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these
      spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the spells you know from this feature and replace it with another
      wizard spell of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Spellcasting Ability</h2>

      <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your
      Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
      addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw
      DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> =
      your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
