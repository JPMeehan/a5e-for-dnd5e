      <p>All inquisitors hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Have Faith. </strong>Have faith in yourself, your actions, and
      above all the order which you serve.</li>

      <li><strong>Loyalty Above All.</strong> Your word is your bond, and
      loyalty is an integral part of who you are.</li>

      <li><strong>Question Everyone. </strong>All outside of your order should
      be regarded as potential heretics, lest worldly connections prevent you
      from carrying out your duty.</li>

      <li><strong>Without Mercy.</strong> You must pass judgment without mercy
      as you carry out divine retribution.</li>

      </ul>
