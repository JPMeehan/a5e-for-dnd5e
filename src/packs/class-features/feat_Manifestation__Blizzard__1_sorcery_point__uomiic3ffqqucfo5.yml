      <p>When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
      point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes cold
      damage from the spell, it is also chilled, reducing its movement speeds by
      10 feet for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell (minimum 1
      round).</p>
