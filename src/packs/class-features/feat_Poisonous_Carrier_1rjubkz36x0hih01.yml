      <p>At 17th level, you learn a truly insidious trick: the ability to turn
      your enemies into a walking trap.</p><p>When you hit a creature with an
      attack and do not have disadvantage, you can spend 1 dose of advanced
      poison to mark that creature with a poisonous sigil. Alternatively, you
      can spend 1 minute to imbue an item of food or drink with a minor magical
      effect which marks the next creature to consume it. The next time a marked
      creature is within 10 feet of another creature friendly to it (which can
      either be a specific creature you specify or any of its allies, at your
      option), the sigil detonates, filling the area within 20 feet of the
      creature with poisonous gas. A creature that enters the gas or begins its
      turn in the gas must make a Constitution saving throw, taking poison
      damage equal to the bonus damage from your Sneak Attack feature on a
      failed save and becoming poisoned for one minute. A creature that succeeds
      on its saving throw takes half damage and is not poisoned. Once you have
      used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier
      (minimum once) you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. The
      mark persists for a number of hours equal to your Intelligence modifier
      (minimum 1) and then dissipates on its own. It may also be dispelled as if
      it were an 8th-level spell.</p><p>In addition, you are immune to poison
      damage and the poisoned condition.</p>
