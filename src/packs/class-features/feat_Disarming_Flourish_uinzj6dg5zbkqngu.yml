    value: >-
      <p>When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can attempt to disarm
      it. If it fails a Strength saving throw , its grip is loosened, and the
      creature cannot make use of the item until it spends a bonus action or
      attack on its turn to regain a solid hold. If the creature has
      disadvantage on the save and fails both rolls, it drops the item.</p>
