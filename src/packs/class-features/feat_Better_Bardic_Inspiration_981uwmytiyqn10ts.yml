      <p>Also at 3rd level, your ability to inspire can help an ally overcome
      deleterious effects. When you have granted a creature Bardic Inspiration,
      if the creature would make a saving throw at the end of its turn to end an
      effect on it, it can use the Bardic Inspiration to attempt a saving throw
      at the start of its turn instead.</p><p>In addition, you can use Bardic
      Inspiration on yourself, but only to make Performance checks.</p>
