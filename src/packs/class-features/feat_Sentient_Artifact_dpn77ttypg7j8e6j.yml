      <p>Starting at 1st level you must establish your artifact&rsquo;s features
      as a sentient magic item. Use the rules for Creating Sentient Magic Items
      to create your artifact&rsquo;s personality and traits either by working
      with your narrator or determining the following randomly:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma scores.</li>

      <li>A way it communicates to you or others.</li>

      <li>A way it senses its surroundings.</li>

      <li>A personality and potential source of conflict.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Your bonded artifact is an NPC controlled by the narrator, but your
      bond is strong and unless you are in conflict with your artifact you are
      always able to utilize its features and direct any actions it can make.
      Your artifact acts on your turn in initiative.</p>

      <p>While you are in conflict with your artifact, you cannot cast any
      wielder spells or use any wielder features that require the use of
      artifact charges.</p>
