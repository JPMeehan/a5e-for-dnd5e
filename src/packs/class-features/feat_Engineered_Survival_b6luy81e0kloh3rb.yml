      <p>At 7th level, you may spend an hour to make a DC 25 engineering check
      and spend 100gp worth of supplies to create a temporary haven. &nbsp;This
      structure can accommodate you and up to your proficiency bonus additional
      medium creatures and lasts 8 hours. &nbsp;You may only attempt this check
      once per long rest, and on a failure expend half the gold in materials.
      You may add your Intelligence modifier to checks with hunting snares and
      fishing traps to see if they gather supply.</p>
