      <p>When you are fighting with a shortsword in each hand, you can use a
      bonus action and spend 2 exertion to hook them together to start a hooked
      swords dance. Until the end of your next turn, your shortswords gain the
      reach property. If you hit a target with both swords in the same turn, the
      target takes an additional [[/r 1d10 #slashing]] slashing damage.</p>
