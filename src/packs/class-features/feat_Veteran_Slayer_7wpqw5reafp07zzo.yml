      <p>At 7th level, you shrug off the curses of your chosen prey. You are
      immune to effects that would change your shape or creature type, such as
      lycanthropy, polymorph effects, and a vampire&rsquo;s bite. You also gain
      one of the following features:</p>

      <h2>Onto Your Tricks</h2>

      <p>You also have advantage on saves to resist being charmed, compelled, or
      frightened by your Studied Adversary.</p>

      <h2>Customized Arsenal</h2>

      <p>You gain proficiency with up to two rare weapons, and either the
      poisoner&rsquo;s kit or the herbalist's kit.</p>

      <h2>Holy Protection</h2>

      <p>Once per long rest, you may use the Turn Undead feature as a cleric of
      your level, but it affects creatures of your Studied Adversary type rather
      than Undead. (If you have chosen Undead as your studied adversary, it
      affects them as normal.)</p>
