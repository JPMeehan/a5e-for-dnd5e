      <p>At 7th level, you&rsquo;ve become precise enough that when given enough
      time to focus you can not only strike your target, but hit specific parts
      of your target to great effect. Once per turn, whenever you take the
      Attack action and are able to make multiple ranged attacks you may forgo
      one of those ranged attacks to turn one of your remaining attacks into a
      Focus Shot. When you make a Focus Shot choose one of the following options
      and make a ranged weapon attack. You gain an expertise die on the attack,
      and on a hit it does your chosen effect in addition to the weapon&rsquo;s
      damage.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Aim for the Eyes.</strong></em> You aim for the
      creature&rsquo;s weak and delicate eyes. The target makes a Dexterity
      saving throw against your maneuver DC or is blinded until it recovers.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Bring it Down. </strong></em>You aim for weak points on the
      creature&rsquo;s legs. The target makes a Constitution saving throw
      against your maneuver DC or its Speed is reduced by half until it
      recovers.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Center of Mass.</strong></em> You aim for the heart or its
      horrid equivalent. Your attack scores a critical hit on a roll of
      19&ndash;20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of
      your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum
      17&ndash;20).</p>

      <p><em><strong>Vein Slice. </strong></em>You aim for a vital vein or
      artery to bleed your target out. The target makes a Constitution saving
      throw against your maneuver DC or it takes 1d6 ongoing damage until it
      recovers.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Wing Clip. </strong></em>You aim for your target&rsquo;s
      wings. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC.
      On a failure, its flying speed is reduced by half until healed. Creatures
      who are currently flying when this saving throw is failed immediately
      plummet 60 feet down and take falling damage as normal.</p>

      <p>Creatures wounded by any of these effects make a Constitution saving
      throw against your maneuver DC at the end of each of their turns,
      recovering and ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively,
      the wounded creature (or a creature within 5 feet of it) can use an action
      to make a Medicine check against your maneuver DC, ending the effect on a
      success. Healing magically or from a trait (such as Regeneration) also
      ends the effect. You cannot choose effects that specifically target
      features a creature does not have.</p>
