      <p>At 14th level you can grant a number of creatures equal to your
      Intelligence modifier proficiency in a skill of your choice that you are
      proficient in when you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p><p>The expertise die
      from Guiding Hand increases to 1d6.</p><p>Alternatively, you may also
      leverage your reputation to give bad advice to lead others to ruin.
      &nbsp;When you use the help action, you may instead attempt to impose
      disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll made within 1 minute
      by a creature within range that can understand at least one language you
      know. &nbsp;If the creature is hostile or otherwise disinclined to take
      your advice and counsel, they are allowed a wisdom save with a DC of 8 +
      your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence modifier, and on a success
      are unaffected and immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.</p>
