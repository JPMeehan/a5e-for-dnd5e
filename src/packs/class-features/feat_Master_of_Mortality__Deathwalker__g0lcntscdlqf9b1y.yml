      <p>At 14th level whenever you finish a short rest, you gain the benefits
      of a&nbsp;<em>death ward</em>&nbsp;spell automatically.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You also have advantage on death
      saving throws.</p><p>Anytime you deal necrotic damage to a creature they
      must make a constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC
      or have their hit point maximum reduced by the same amount.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A creature dies if its hit point
      maximum is reduced to 0, and such a creature may not be returned to life
      by anything short of a wish spell.</p>
