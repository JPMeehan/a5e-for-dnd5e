      <p>You always know to have a bit of magnet and a pin on you for
      orienteering emergencies. With 1 minute&rsquo;s work you can cobble
      together a makeshift compass. Compasses made in this way become useless
      after 1 hour and have no sale value. You&rsquo;re also adept at surveying
      your surroundings and you gain an expertise die on checks made for the
      Chronicle journey activity.</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain proficiency in Survival and its wayfinding skill
      specialty. If you already have this skill specialty you instead gain a
      Survival skill specialty of your choice.</p>
