      detailed in the Level Up Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide.) You gain an exertion
      point pool equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p>Choose two martial traditions. (Most savants learn maneuvers of the
      traditions Biting Zephyr, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current, or Sanguine
      Knot.) Whenever you gain a savant trick, you can instead choose a maneuver
      from any of your chosen martial traditions.</p>

      gain access to 2nd degree maneuvers, then at 13th level you can access 3rd
      degree maneuvers, and finally at 19th level you can access 4th degree
      maneuvers.</p>
