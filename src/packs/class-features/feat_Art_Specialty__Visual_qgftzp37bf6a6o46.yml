      <p>There are many ways to undertake a visual performance whether through
      illustration, illusion magic, or legerdemain. When using this art as a
      spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell you may choose to make an ally
      able to see you the point of origin of that spell. You must be able to see
      any targets of the spell.</p>
