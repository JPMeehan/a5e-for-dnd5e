      <blockquote><p>At 1st level, you draw too close to the secrets of the
      light, transforming your mind with agonizing glory. Your patron’s
      revelation grants you knowledge of a life-giving
      secret.</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>You learn two
      bonus cantrips of your choice from <em>celestial burst</em>,
      <em>guidance</em>, <em>light </em>and <em>sacred
      flame</em>.</p><p></p><p>You gain a pool of solace dice, which represents
      your patron’s help in accessing the shreds of magical grace which suffuse
      the multiverse. Your solace dice pool contains a number of d6s equal to 1+
      your warlock level. </p><ul><li><p>As a bonus action, you can heal a
      creature you can see within 60 feet. Spend solace dice up to an amount
      equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1). Roll these dice;
      the creature regains that many hit
      points.</p><p></p></li><li><p>Alternatively, when you hit a creature with
      a weapon or spell attack, before rolling for damage you learn whether or
      not that creature has temporary hit points. You can immediately expend
      solace dice up to an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier
      (minimum 1), roll those dice, and remove from the creature a number of
      temporary hit points equal to double that total.</p></li></ul><p>You
      regain any spent solace dice when you complete a long rest.</p>
