      <p>Beginning at 17th level, the gods bless you with a celestial talisman
      in the shape of a cup. In your hands it becomes a physical cup that
      provides all the hot drink (though not all the cups) needed for any of
      your features.</p>

      <p>Once between long rests you can call upon the blessings of the gods and
      drink from the cup. Afterwards, you are immune to the blinded, deafened,
      charmed, and poisoned conditions. In addition, you can spend 1 exertion to
      use your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.8qussvvvmp9ap32y]{Serene
      Mind} feature on any ability check. Finally, once per combat you can use a
      bonus action to drink from the cup and roll your martial arts die,
      regaining an equal amount of exertion. These effects all last until the
      end of your next long rest.</p>

      <p>If your talisman is destroyed, the gods provide another after you
      complete a worthy task to prove your continued dedication.</p>
