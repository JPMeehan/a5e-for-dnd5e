      <p>Beginning at 17th level, the gods bless you with a celestial talisman
      in the shape of a cup. In your hands it becomes a physical cup that
      provides all the hot drink (though not all the cups) needed for any of
      your features.</p><p>Once between long rests you can call upon the
      blessings of the gods and drink from the cup. Afterwards, you are immune
      to the blinded, deafened, charmed, and poisoned conditions. In addition,
      you can spend 1 exertion to use your Serene Mind feature on any ability
      check. Finally, once per combat you can use a bonus action to drink from
      the cup and roll your martial arts die, regaining an equal amount of
      exertion. These effects all last until the end of your next long
      rest.</p><p>If your talisman is destroyed, the gods provide another after
      you complete a worthy task to prove your continued dedication.</p>
