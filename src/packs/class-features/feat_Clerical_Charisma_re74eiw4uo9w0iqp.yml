      <p>Crowds find your public presence irresistible. You gain proficiency in
      the Performance skill. Whenever you use Performance to deliver a sermon or
      to sing holy songs in a town or city, even on a failed check other than a
      natural 1, you still attract a crowd of people no smaller than your spell
      save DC.</p>
