      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to bend your magic in flexible,
      constantly-changing ways. When you finish a short or long rest, you can
      choose a benefit from the following list. You can expend your Flux to use
      that benefit.</p><p>When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can
      change your benefit to a different one, recharging your Flux. Otherwise
      your Flux recharges when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><p><strong><em>Ad Hoc Defense.</em></strong> When you take
      damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal
      to your proficiency bonus.</p>
