      <p>At 17th level youâ€™ve mastered the art of rerouting power, quick welds,
      and improvising on the spot to keep your spell inventions functional. When
      rolling the fizzle die would burn out one of your spell inventions, you
      can use your reaction to fix it and restore it to full working order. Once
      you repair a spell invention in this way you cannot do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
