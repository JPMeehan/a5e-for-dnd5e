      <p>You learn the&nbsp;find familiar&nbsp;spell and can cast it as a
      ritual. The spell doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of spells known.
      When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your
      familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit,
      sprite, or any Tiny creature of CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt for the
      spirit you call forth to be an aberration, elemental, or undead.</p>

      <p>When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks
      to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
      Additionally, when you use Eldritch Scythe, you can choose to deliver the
      attack through your familiar as though you had cast a spell with a range
      of Touch.</p>
