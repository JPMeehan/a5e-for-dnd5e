      <p>You learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find
      Familiar} spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn&rsquo;t count
      against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can
      choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following
      special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, sprite, or any Tiny creature of
      CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt for the spirit you call forth to be an
      aberration, elemental, or undead.</p><p>When you take the Attack action,
      you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one
      attack of its own with its reaction. Additionally, when you use
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.5miit65bic46eynl]{Eldritch
      Scythe}, you can choose to deliver the attack through your familiar as
      though you had cast a spell with a range of Touch.</p>
