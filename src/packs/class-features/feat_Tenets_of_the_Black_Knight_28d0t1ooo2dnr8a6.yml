      <p>All black knights hold similar tenets, regardless of any master they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Survival.</strong> Do what you must to live and fight another
      day.</li>

      <li><strong>Practicality.</strong> If it&rsquo;s stupid and it works,
      it&rsquo;s not stupid. Get the job done and seize power where you can find
      it. Worry about what others think later, if at all.</li>

      <li><strong>Prowess.</strong> Keep your skills and weapons sharp. You
      never know when you will need them.</li>

      <li><strong>Menace.</strong> If it is not possible to be both, it is
      better to be feared than loved.</li>

      </ul>
