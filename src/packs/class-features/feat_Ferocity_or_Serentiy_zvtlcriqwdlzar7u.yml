      <p>At 9th level you choose to embrace either the wild savagery of nature
      or the control you need to protect it. Choose one of the following:</p><h3
      class="Indent1">Embraced Ferocity</h3><p>You gain a +2 bonus on attack
      rolls you make while in a Wild Shape. In addition, whenever you use Wild
      Shape to transform into a creature, you gain a number of temporary hit
      points equal to 1d8 &times; the creature&rsquo;s CR (minimum 1d8) instead
      of 1d4 &times; CR.</p><h3 class="Indent1">Embraced Serentiy</h3><p>You
      have&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;on&nbsp;concentration checks made to maintain
      spells. In addition, as a bonus action you may sacrifice a use of Wild
      Shape to recover an expended spell slot of 3rd-level or lower, or two uses
      of your Wild Shape feature to recover an expended spell slot of 6th-level
      or lower.</p>
