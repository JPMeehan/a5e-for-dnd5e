      <p>You have an affinity for animals and they tend to trust you. You can
      always use Wisdom for Animal Handling checks and if a creature of the
      Beast type would normally be indifferent to you, it is friendly instead.
      This has no effect on creatures that would normally be hostile, even if
      you have a similar feature or benefit that would make a hostile creature
      indifferent.</p>
