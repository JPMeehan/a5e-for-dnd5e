      <p>Also at 2nd level, you can peer into flames to learn of what lies
      ahead. By spending 10 minutes meditating while staring into a flame that
      fills at least a 5-foot cube, you can cast augury without spending any
      spell slots. </p><p>At 6th level, by burning an object with a connection
      to a creature and spending 10 minutes in meditation, you can cast locate
      creature in this way. </p><p>At 10th level, by creating a fire large
      enough to fully immerse yourself in and stepping into it (taking no
      damage), you can cast dream, with yourself as the messenger. If the fire
      goes out before you end the spell, you take 4d6 psychic damage and the
      spell ends. After casting it in this way, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
