      <p>Starting 14th level, when you spend your last Bardic Inspiration you
      can spend a spell slot of a level no higher than your Charisma bonus as a
      free action to help drive the story. You regain a number of uses of Bardic
      Inspiration equal to half the spell slot spent (rounded up). Spending
      higher-level spells in this way only yields a number of uses equal to half
      your Charisma bonus (rounded up).</p>
