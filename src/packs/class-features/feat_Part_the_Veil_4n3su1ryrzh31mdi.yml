      <p>When you select this archetype at 1st level, you begin to learn how to
      manipulate the powers and energies of death. You learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.omvngnmoo75is54f]{Spare the
      Dying} cantrip, which does not count against your number of cantrips
      known. Choose one of the following:</p>

      <h2>Death Curse</h2>

      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>

      <p>The curse has the following effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>When you deal damage against to cursed creature, it takes additional
      1d4 necrotic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again
      at 15th and 20th level.</li>

      <li>When that creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies, the curse
      ends, and you regain hit points equal to 1d8+your warlock level.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h2>Mortal Defiance</h2>

      <p>You can cast spare the dying as a bonus action. In addition, when you
      are reduced to 0 hit points as a reaction you may cast spare the dying on
      yourself.</p>

      <p>When you cast spare the dying on another creature that is actually
      dying, you regain hit points equal to 1d8 + you Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p>You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.</p>
