      <p>At 1st level you adopt a particular style of fighting. Choose one of
      the following options. You can&rsquo;t take a particular Fighting Style
      more than once.</p>

      <h2>Archery</h2>

      <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons.</p>

      <h2>Battle Ready</h2>

      <p>You can activate up to two combat stances you know without expending
      any exertion points using the same bonus action. Once you activate a set
      of combat stances in this way, you can&rsquo;t use this feature again
      until you finish a rest.</p>

      <h2>Defense</h2>

      <p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing armor.</p>

      <h2>Dueling</h2>

      <p>You deal an extra 2 damage with melee weapons held in one hand while
      you aren&rsquo;t wielding another weapon.</p>

      <h2>Great Weapon Fighting</h2>

      <p>When you hit with a versatile or two-handed weapon you are wielding in
      two hands, you can reroll any 1 or 2 on a damage die. You must use the new
      roll, even if it is a 1 or 2.</p>

      <h2>Mounted Combatant</h2>

      <p>While mounted, you gain an expertise die on attack rolls against
      creatures that are Medium or smaller and not mounted. In addition, you
      gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being
      dismounted.</p>

      <h2>Protection</h2>

      <p>When a creature you can see attacks another target within 5 feet of
      you, if you are wielding a shield you can use your reaction to hinder the
      attack, forcing the creature to roll with disadvantage.</p>

      <h2>Technical Fighting</h2>

      <p>Whenever you use a combat maneuver, any damage dealt by attacks using
      it deals an additional 2 damage, and your maneuver DC increases by 1.</p>

      <h2>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h2>

      <p>Whenever you would make an attack using a weapon with the Thrown
      property, you can draw the weapon as part of the attack. In addition, your
      ranged weapon attacks with thrown weapons deal an additional 2 damage.</p>

      <h2>Tireless Fighting</h2>

      <p>Whenever you expend Hit Dice to recover exertion points, you recover 3
      exertion points per Hit Die expended (instead of 1d4 exertion points as
      normal).</p>

      <h2>Two-Weapon Fighting</h2>

      <p>While two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
      damage of the off-hand attack.</p>

      <h2>Unarmed Fighting</h2>

      <p>Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your
      Strength modifier. If you aren&rsquo;t wielding any weapons or a shield,
      you can strike with both of your hands to deal damage equal to 1d8 + your
      Strength modifier. If you start your turn grappling a creature, you can
      deal your basic melee damage to any creature you are grappling.</p>
