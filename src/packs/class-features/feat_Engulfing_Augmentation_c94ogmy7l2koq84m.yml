      spending 7 spell points, your blast engulfs targets in stone or ice,
      paralyzing them for up to 1 minute but also protecting them from harm. An
      unwilling target can attempt a Strength saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns to break free. The stone or ice encasing them has AC 10 and 50
      HP, and the paralysis ends if the hp is reduced to 0; ice is vulnerable to
      fire damage, stone is vulnerable to thunder damage. Flying targets fall,
      though the stone or ice takes the falling damage for them and may end the
      effect.</span></p>
