      <p>Also at 14th level, you can automatically sense the presence of trapped
      or imprisoned souls, such as those contained in a magic jar, a weapon that
      steals the souls of those it slays, or other similar receptacles. As an
      action, you may choose to release any such souls within 30 feet to their
      final judgment. The effect this has on the soul’s former container is left
      to the Narrator’s discretion.</p>
