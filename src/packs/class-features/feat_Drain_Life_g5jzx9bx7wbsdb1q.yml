      <p dir="ltr">Beginning at 8th level, whenever you deal damage with a whip,
      flail, scythe, or a spell that deals necrotic damage, you may choose to
      regain a number of hit points equal to your wisdom modifier. If you are
      already at maximum hit points, you instead gain temporary hit points. Once
      you have used this feature to heal or gain temporary hit points a number
      of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
