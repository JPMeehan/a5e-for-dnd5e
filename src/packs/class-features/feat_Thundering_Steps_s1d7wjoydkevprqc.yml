      <p>At level 10, your movement alone shakes the earth. While you are
      raging, whenever you move, you deal 1d6 thunder damage to all creatures
      that are on the ground and occupying or adjacent to squares you move
      through. You (and your mount, if applicable) are unaffected by this
      damage, as are other creatures with this archetype and their mounts. A
      target can only be affected by this damage once from any given creature in
      a round.</p>
