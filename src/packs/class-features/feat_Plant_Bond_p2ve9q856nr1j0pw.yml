      <p>You have a mystic connection with flora. As an action you can expend 2
      uses of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild
      Shape} to summon a plant creature with a CR no greater than 1/3 your druid
      level in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. Plants summoned
      in this way are allied to you and your companions. While plants summoned
      in this way are within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally
      command them. When you command multiple plants in this way, you must give
      them all the same command. You may decide the action the plant takes and
      where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command,
      such as guarding an area. If not given a command, a summoned plant only
      defends itself. Plants you summon in this way remain for up to 8 hours, or
      until killed or magically dismissed as a bonus action.</p>
