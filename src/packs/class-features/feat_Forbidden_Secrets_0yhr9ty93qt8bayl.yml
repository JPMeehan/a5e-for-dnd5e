      <p dir="ltr">Also at 2nd level, you have not only learned skills that are
      usually frowned upon by others, but extensive knowledge in those fields
      too. You gain proficiency in the Arcana and Religion skills, as well as
      the Undead and Forbidden Knowledge skill specialties.</p>
