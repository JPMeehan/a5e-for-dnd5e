      <p>At 18th level you are finally craft your masterpiece. You gain the
      ability to craft a single Artifact. You must first spend at least 4 weeks
      of downtime researching the item, after which you must succeed on a DC 30
      Intelligence check with your chosen tool proficiency to figure out how to
      do it. Crafting the item requires 30 + 5d8 weeks of work and has a DC of
      30. The following guidelines should be followed to determine what the item
      is; if they cannot be or at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may
      customize your artifact further.</p><p>Choose a legendary item that can be
      crafted with your tool, or a non-legendary weapon or armor that could be
      crafted by your tool and increase its bonus to AC/to hit and damage by 1
      for every rarity lower than legendary. Artifacts crafted from unusual
      materials do not suffer from the Flaw property, and the artifact cannot
      become damaged or broken under normal circumstances. Work with the
      Narrator to determine the circumstances that would allow it to be
      destroyed.</p><p>Upon successfully crafting it it also gains artifact
      properties, which should be randomly rolled: 2 minor benefits, 1 major
      benefit, and 1 minor detriment.</p>
