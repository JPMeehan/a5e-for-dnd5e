      <p>At 18th level, if you have
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.v4pkjilh484jph6i]{Precision
      Strikes}, you no longer need a bonus action to activate it in conjunction
      with a crossbow, geared slingshot, or firearm. &nbsp;<br>If you have
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.okthtwyohmh0eoa5]{Mystic
      Apprentice}, you have instead found a way to blend mundane technology and
      magic in a way that uses the former to enhance the latter, adding your
      Intelligence modifier to a single damage roll for any cantrip you cast. In
      addition, if you have
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-feats.Item.fs2rwplugvwip86h]{Crossbow Expertise},
      casting a cantrip that deals damage counts as taking the attack action in
      order to allow an off-hand attack with a hand crossbow or one handed
      firearm.</p>
