      it, you have not managed to suppress its effects entirely. When you select
      this archetype, select one of the following
      options:</p><ul><li><strong>Unmoored:</strong> You permanently suffer the
      Bewildered mental stress effect.</li><li><strong>Paranoid:</strong> You
      permanently suffer the On Edge mental stress effect.</li><li dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Troubled:</strong> You permanently suffer the
      Sleepless mental stress effect.</li><li dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Fettered:</strong> Your movement speeds are
      reduced by 10 feet.</li><li dir="ltr"
      role="presentation"><strong>Gravebound:</strong> When a critical hit is
      scored against you, make a DC 15 Constitution save. On a failed save, you
      immediately drop to 0 hit points.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"
