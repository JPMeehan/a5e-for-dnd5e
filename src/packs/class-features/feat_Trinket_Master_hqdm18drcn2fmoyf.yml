      <p>At 10th level youâ€™ve mastered the simpler enchantments and
      technological principles. What once was careful trial and error has been
      replaced with factory-like efficiency and speed. Whenever you craft a
      magic item that has a gold cost of 50 or less, the crafting time is
      reduced to a long rest (this time cannot be further reduced by any
      features or traits).</p>
