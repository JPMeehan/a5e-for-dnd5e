      <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers.
      You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following
      list:</p><ul><li>Biting Zephyr</li><li>Mist and Shade</li><li>Arcane
      Artillery</li></ul><p>You select two combat maneuvers taken from the
      traditions that you&rsquo;ve chosen and gain additional maneuvers at 2nd
      level and every even numbered level after that.</p><p>You gain an exertion
      pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion
      at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending
      points from your exertion pool.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level you may
      choose one maneuver you know and replace it with another maneuver of your
      choice which may be of the highest degree you are capable of, or
      lower.</p>
