      <p>You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks, and you can
      channel healing power into your mount, soothing tired muscles and calming
      its pounding heart, allowing it to briefly exceed its normal limits. While
      riding a mount, you can spend 10
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.my42mip0qc35rcp2]{Lay
      on Hands} points to allow your mount to move at a gallop speed for an
      additional hour. Once a given mount has been affected by this feature, it
      cannot be again until it has finished a long rest.</p>
