      <p class="preFade fadeIn">At 14th level you become a true master of the
      undead. You may use a bonus action to command one undead creature which
      can hear you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw vs. your spell
      DC. On a failure, the undead creature becomes unable to attack you for one
      minute, and obeys your commands for the duration. The creature can make a
      new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
      success.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Once a creature succeeds in a saving throw against this feature, it
      becomes immune to the feature for 24 hours.</p>
