      <p>You can spend a day (8 hours) building a basic shelter which protects
      up to 8 people from the elements and reduces the likelihood of attack from
      monsters and bandits. The shelter counts as a haven. It lasts for as long
      as it is needed, but falls apart permanently after being left for a month
      unattended.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again
      for a week.</p>
