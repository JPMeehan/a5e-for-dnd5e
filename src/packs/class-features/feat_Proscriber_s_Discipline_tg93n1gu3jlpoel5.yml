      <blockquote><p>You have moved beyond standard magical training into the
      specialized training befitting one who is to stand against threats to the
      world itself. At this stage you are a neophyte and are often under the
      tutelage of a more experienced Proscriber, though in times of crisis, even
      very inexperienced Proscribers may be sent out to do what they can against
      the darkness.</p></blockquote><p>You gain proficiency with the
      <em>Arcana</em> and <em>Religion</em> skills, or gain an expertise die if
      you are already proficient. You also gain the <em>Aberrations</em> skill
      specialty for Arcana and the <em>Fiends</em> skill specialty for religion.
      You may select another skill specialty for a relevant skill if you already
      possess one of these skill specialties.</p><p>In addition, you learn one
      of the most important and dangerous techniques of the Proscriber order. If
      you are affected by the <em>charmed</em>, <em>confused</em>,
      <em>frightened</em>, <em>incapacitated</em>, <em>paralyzed</em>,
      <em>petrified</em>, or <em>stunned</em> conditions, you may choose to
      spend a hit die and gain a level of strife (no action required). The
      condition ends immediately.</p>
