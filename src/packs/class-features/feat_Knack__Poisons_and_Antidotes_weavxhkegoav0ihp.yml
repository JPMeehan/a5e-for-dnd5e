      <p>Once between long rests you can spend 10 minutes to extract 3 doses of
      liquid poison (when ingested, a creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving
      throw or is poisoned for 1 hour) from poisonous plants youâ€™ve foraged with
      an hour of searching and DC 10 Survival check. Alternatively, using the
      same plants you can spend an hour making a dose of antitoxin (see Chapter
      4: Equipment).</p>
