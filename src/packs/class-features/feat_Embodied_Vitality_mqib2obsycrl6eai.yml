      <p>At 14th level, you gain an additional Primal Vitality or Ingrained
      Vitality feature you haven&rsquo;t previously selected, as well as your
      choice of one of the following.</p>

      <h2>Familiar Bond</h2>

      <p><em>Prerequisite: Overgrown Summons</em></p>

      <p>You can summon a plant creature using your Plant Bond feature without
      expending any uses of your Wild Shape feature. Once you summon a plant in
      this way, you can&rsquo;t do so without expending uses of Wild Shape until
      you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h2>Noxious Miasma</h2>

      <p><em>Prerequisite: Deathly Nectar</em></p>

      <p>As an action you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cause
      yourself or a creature you&rsquo;ve summoned to give off a noxious miasma
      in a 10-foot radius for the next minute. Whenever a non-plant creature
      other than you starts its turn within the miasma or moves there for the
      first time on its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw against
      your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.</p>

      <h2>Verdant Sovereign</h2>

      <p><em>Prerequisite: Verdant Beguiler</em></p>

      <p>When you emit charming spores using your Verdant Beauty feature, you
      can choose to affect the target as per the charm monster spell.</p>

      <p>If you don&rsquo;t meet any of the prerequisites, you instead gain an
      additional Primal Vitality and an additional Ingrained Vitality feature
      you haven&rsquo;t previously selected.</p>
