      <p>At 16th level, basic survival skills have become second nature to you.
      Choose one of the following options:</p><h3 class="Indent1">Under the
      Stars</h3><p>You gain the benefits of a long rest in half the normal
      amount of time.</p><h3 class="Indent1">Woodlore</h3><p>Using your action,
      you can produce a flame at a moment&rsquo;s notice even in wet or cold
      environments. You can hold the flame in your hand without harming yourself
      or your equipment. Without additional fuel, the flame lasts for 10
      minutes, shedding&nbsp;bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for
      an additional 10 feet.</p>
