    value: >-
      <p>You gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks made to recall lore or
      gather information about weapons, armor, and other martial equipment. In
      addition, you can use an action to investigate the magical properties of
      such an item by handling it, such as swinging a sword or hefting a shield.
      You learn its properties, how to use them, whether it requires attunement,
      and how many charges it has. You also learn if the item has any sentience
      or bears a curse, though you only learn if it is sentient or cursed (not
      the nature of that sentience or curse).</p>
