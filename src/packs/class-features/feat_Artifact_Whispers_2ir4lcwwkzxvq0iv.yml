      <p>As your bond with your artifact has grown, you&rsquo;ve noticed a pull,
      a whisper in your mind giving you insights and skills beyond your own
      capacities. At 4th level, you gain an artifact whisper of your choice, the
      artifact whispers available to you are detailed at the end of the class
      description. The artifact whispers column of the Wielder table shows you
      when you gain more artifact whispers.</p>
