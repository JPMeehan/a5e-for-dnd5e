    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level whenever you cast a spell that summons a beast, plant,
      elemental, or fey, any creatures summoned gain temporary hit points equal
      to a roll of a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus. If multiple
      creatures are summoned by one spell, they all gain the same number of
      temporary hit points. They also gain an expertise die on saving throws and
      attack rolls.</p>
