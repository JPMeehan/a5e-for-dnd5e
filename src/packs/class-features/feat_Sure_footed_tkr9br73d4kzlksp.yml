      <p>Also at 11th level, you become so accustomed to navigating field
      hazards that they no longer impede you. You are unaffected by non-magical
      difficult terrain, and you also have advantage on saving throws against
      environmental hazards (such as the ones described in the Encounter
      Elements rules).</p>
