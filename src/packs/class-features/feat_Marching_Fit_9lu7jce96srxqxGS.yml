      dir="ltr">Keeping soldiers&rsquo; feet in marching shape starts with the
      right footwear. You gain proficiency in cobbler&rsquo;s tools. By spending
      1 hour (which may be part of a short or long rest) with cobbler&rsquo;s
      tools and a pair of mundane boots or other footwear, you may temporarily
      modify them to suit one form of difficult terrain, such as slick ice or
      deep mud. While these boots are worn, the wearer&rsquo;s movement is not
      impeded by the difficult terrain selected at the time of construction.
      This modification lasts for 1 week unless you spend another hour to
      replace or reinforce the modification, which resets the remaining
      time.</p>
