      <p>A wielder&rsquo;s magic and supernatural abilities come not from
      themselves but rather their bonded artifact and their connection to
      it.</p>

      <h2>Artifact Charges</h2>

      <p>The Wielder table shows how many charges your artifact has. To cast one
      of your wielder spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of
      charges dependent on the spell's level, shown on the table below. You can
      also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by spending the
      appropriate number of charges. The maximum spell level you can cast is
      shown in the Spell Level column of the Wielder table. You regain all
      expended charges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <h3>Charges</h3>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Wielder
      spell list.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The Spells Known column of the Wielder table shows when you
      learn more wielder spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of
      a level that you are able to cast. For instance, when you reach 5th level
      in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st- or 2nd-level.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
      choose one of the wielder spells you know and replace it with another
      spell from the wielder spell list, which also must be of a level of which
      you can cast.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Spellcasting Ability</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">Your connection to your bonded artifact empowers your
      spellcasting, and depending on your chosen Archetype your spellcasting
      ability may be either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You use the
      spellcasting ability shown in your Wielder&rsquo;s Bond whenever a spell
      refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use that ability
      modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wielder spell you cast and
      when making an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8
      + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p>

      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Spell attack
      modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability
      modifier&nbsp;</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">Artifact Focus</h2>

      <p dir="ltr">Your bonded artifact acts as your spellcasting focus for your
      wielder spells.</p>
