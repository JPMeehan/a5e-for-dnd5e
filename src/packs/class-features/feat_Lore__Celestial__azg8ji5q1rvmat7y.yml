    value: >-
      <p>You learn the true name of an minor celestial being, and by speaking it
      and expending a hit die you may call it forth as a familiar. It takes the
      form of a sprite or psuedodragon, except its creature type is Celestial,
      and it gains the Good, Lawful and Good, or Chaotic and Good alignment
      traits. You may later dismiss this familiar to its home plane with an
      action by spending another hit die, and you cannot temporarily dismiss it
      into a pocket dimension. It otherwise follows the normal rules for the
      find familiar spell.</p><p>If both this and Fiendish Lore are taken, it
      allows you to have two familiars at once, though summoning the second one
      without dismissing the first inflicts a level of fatigue in addition to
      the normal costs.</p>
