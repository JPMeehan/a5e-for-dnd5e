      <p>At level 10, when you roll dice to determine the damage of a spell
      which does area-of-effect damage (circle, cone, cube, cylinder, line,
      sphere, or square), your damage dice explode. This means that you can
      reroll any dice that have the maximum result and add them to the total.
      For example, if you cast fireball and roll three 6s among your damage
      dice, you roll an additional 3d6, and continue to reroll any 6s adding
      them to the total damage dealt.</p>
