      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you start your turn in an area of darkness
      or magical darkness, you gain a Darkness die, a d6. You can have only one
      Darkness die at a time. At any time, you can roll your Darkness die and
      apply the result to one of the following: your AC against one attack made
      by a creature you can see, an attack or damage roll you make with a
      weapon, or a Stealth skill check. You can apply your Darkness die even
      after&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">making an attack
      roll</span>&nbsp;or after the result of a creature&rsquo;s attack roll is
      declared.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, your Darkness die increases to a d8.</p>
