      <p>Also at 3rd level, when you prepare your artificer spells you can
      prepare certain spells and create spell inventions for them (or forgo them
      for modifications to your custom vehicle) in addition to your normal
      number of prepared spells. These spells count as artificer spells for you,
      even if they arenâ€™t on the artificer spell list.</p><p><strong>TABLE:
