      <p dir="ltr">Beginning at 6th level, you can treat water as solid ground
      when it suits you. You are continuously under the effects of the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.qmz47cw7wmy78gyc]{Water Walk}
      spell, and your swim speed increases by 20 feet.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You also gain one of the following features:</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Eel Skin</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">Your body stores a potent electrical current. When you are
      hit by a melee weapon attack, you may use your reaction to deal a number
      of d8s of lightning damage equal to your proficiency bonus to the
      attacking creature.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Aquatic Predator</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">When you use your Wild Shape to transform into a creature
      with both a bite attack and a swim speed, you gain an expertise die on
      Stealth and Athletics checks while in the water. <br>In addition, once per
      turn, you can deal extra damage when you hit a creature with a bite
      attack. The amount of extra damage is a number of d6s equal to half your
      proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In order to apply this damage, you must not have disadvantage
      on the attack and your target must be within 5 feet of another enemy of
      the target who is not incapacitated. Alternatively, you can apply this
      damage if you have advantage on the attack.</p>
