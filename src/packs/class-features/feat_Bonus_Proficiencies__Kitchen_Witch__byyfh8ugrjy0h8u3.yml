      dir="ltr">When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you gain
      proficiency in either cook&rsquo;s utensils or brewer&rsquo;s supplies.
      You may also use what some would call unusual implements as your
      spellcasting focus. Choose one implement from the toolkit chosen, such as
      a kitchen knife, wooden spoon, rolling pin, or other similar object. This
      item counts as a spellcasting focus for you. If your focus is lost or
      destroyed, it may be replaced as a ritual that takes 10 minutes and 5 gp
      of natural materials you would use in your practice (such as dried cooking
      herbs and wood from a cooking fire).</p>
