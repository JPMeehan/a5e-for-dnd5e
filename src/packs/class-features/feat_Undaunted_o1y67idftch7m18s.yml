      <p>While exploring a place which you have never been to before, you can
      use your reaction to gain advantage on ability checks and attack rolls
      until the end of your next turn. You can do so a number of times equal to
      your Wisdom modifier, and regain spent uses upon finishing a long
      rest.</p>
