      <p>Mercenary groups make a point of making your acquaintance, especially
      in larger towns. As part of their hospitality they feed you and your
      companions, and provide a safe place to sleep, as well as offer to trade
      information and word of any jobs your group may be interested in. When
      these meetings go particularly well they might offer more tangible help in
      the form&nbsp;of scouting the area around a monsterâ€™s den or distracting a
      group of bandits to give you an edge.</p>
