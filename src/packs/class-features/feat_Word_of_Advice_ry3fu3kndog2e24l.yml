      <p>At 1st level, when you prepare an aegis trick, you can instead
      communicate the idea to an ally that can understand you within 10 feet.
      Until the end of your next turn, that ally can use that trick as if they
      had prepared it. The trick still uses your trick DC.</p><p>If either of
      you use the trick, it expends it for both of you. If the ally doesnâ€™t use
      the trick before the end of your next turn, it remains available for you
      until you use it.</p><p>At 6th level, the range of this ability increases
      to 30 feet.</p>
