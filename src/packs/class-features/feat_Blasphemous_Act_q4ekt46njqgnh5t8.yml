      <p>At 10th level, you can siphon away divine power intended for the gods’
      chosen. At the end of each long rest, you gain a Channel Divinity feature.
      This feature must be from a cleric archetype and granted to clerics of 2nd
      level. Alternatively, you can instead gain Turn Undead with the benefit of
      the Command Undead empowerment.</p><p>Once you have used the chosen cleric
      feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
