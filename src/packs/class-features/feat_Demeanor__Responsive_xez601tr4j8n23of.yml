      <p>Whether between duelists or armies, combat is all about timing and you
      are impeccably punctual. When you overhear an interesting conversation
      between NPCs, you can interject so seamlessly and casually that the
      speakers think they already know you, answering one question you ask
      before realizing that they donâ€™t.</p><p>In addition, you gain an expertise
      die on Persuasion checks.</p>
