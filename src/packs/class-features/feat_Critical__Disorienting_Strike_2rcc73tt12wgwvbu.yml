    value: >-
      <p>The force of your attack leaves your target seeing double. When you
      score a critical hit, your target treats all creatures as though they have
      half cover (+2 to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to
      hide). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency
      bonus and does not stack with subsequent critical hits.</p>
