      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
      Investigation, Insight, and Perception, and you gain an expertise die on
      checks made using any of these skills. For you, expertise dice in these
      skills can be upgraded from d8 to d10, exceeding the usual limit on
      expertise dice. You can use all three of these skills with your Cunning
      Action when theyâ€™d normally take an action.</p>
