      <p>At 14th level, you can instantly traverse the Dreaming to a place of
      hopeful refuge. You can use an action to teleport yourself and up to five
      willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, disappearing in flashes of
      bright color or a vortex of leaves. You each reappear no further than 1
      mile away, in the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of your
      Toadstool Sanctuary, or a fairy ring or monolith consecrated to the fey
      which you have previously seen. If you are already at such a location when
      you use this feature, you and the creatures instead teleport into or
      return from the Dreaming.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t
      do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
