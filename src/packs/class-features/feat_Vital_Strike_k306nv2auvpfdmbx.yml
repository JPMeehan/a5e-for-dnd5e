      <p>You become the master of a precise, vicious cut in just the right
      place. Once per round, when you hit a creature with an attack using one of
      your Fencer’s Arsenal weapons, you may spend 2 exertion points to do
      ongoing damage to your target equal to your martial arts die, which lasts
      for 1 minute or until the target uses an action to stanch the wound.
      Constructs, Undead, and Oozes are not affected by this feature.</p>
