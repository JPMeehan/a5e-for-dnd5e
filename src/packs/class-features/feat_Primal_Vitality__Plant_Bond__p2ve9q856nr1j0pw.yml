      <p>At 6th level your outpouring of natural power begins manifesting in new
      ways. </p><h3><strong>Plant Bond</strong></h3><p>You have a mystic
      connection with flora. As an action you can expend 2 uses of Wild Shape to
      summon a plant creature with a CR no greater than 1/3 your druid level in
      an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. Plants summoned in this
      way are allied to you and your companions. While plants summoned in this
      way are within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command
      them. When you command multiple plants in this way, you must give them all
      the same command. You may decide the action the plant takes and where it
      moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as
      guarding an area. If not given a command, a summoned plant only defends
      itself. Plants you summon in this way remain for up to 8 hours, or until
      killed or magically dismissed as a bonus action.</p>
