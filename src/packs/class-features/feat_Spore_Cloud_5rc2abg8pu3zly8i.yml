      <p>Also at 6th level, you can release spores to impair your enemies. As an
      action, you may spend a use of your Wild Shape feature to release a cloud
      of spores that lasts for one hour. The spore cloud fills a 10-foot radius
      sphere emanating from you, and moves along with you. Creatures other than
      you that begin their turn in the cloud must make a Constitution saving
      throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned for one minute. While
      poisoned this way, a creature experiences bizarre and sometimes
      frightening hallucinations. It treats all targets as lightly obscured, and
      it has disadvantage on checks to maintain concentration. If the creature
      fails its save by 5 or more, it is also frightened until the end of its
      next turn. Creatures that succeed on their save are unaffected, but must
      repeat the saving throw each turn as long as they remain in the cloud.
      Once a creature exits the cloud, they may repeat their save at the end of
      each of their turns, ending all effects on a success.</p>

      <p>Undead, Constructs, and creatures immune to poison damage are
      unaffected by the spores.</p>
