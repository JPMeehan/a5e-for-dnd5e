  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you or a friendly creature within the range of your Commanding
      Presence makes a successful weapon attack against a creature that has been
      marked with your Mark Foe feature, the attack deals 1d4 ongoing damage for
      one minute or until the creature or one of its allies spends an action to
      stanch the wound. A target can only suffer one instance of this ability
      from any given creature at a time. Multiple hits from the same creature
      reset the duration of the ongoing damage, but do not increase the amount
      of it. </p>
