      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
      Channel Divinity options:</p><h3 style="text-align: start">Volcanic
      Fury</h3><p style="text-align: start">In response to witnessing an
      injustice or atrocity (or its after effects) you may use your reaction to
      erupt with righteous wrath. For the next hour, you have advantageous
      attack rolls and Intimidate checks against creatures involved in the
      triggering event, and your weapon attacks do an additional 1d6 fire damage
      to them. If you (with help from your companions) manage to slay all of the
      offending parties before the hour ends, you regain the spent use of
      channel divinity.</p><h3 style="text-align: start">Lava Sculptor</h3><p
      style="text-align: start">As an action, you may create one of the
      following. Unless otherwise noted, it must be created in an empty space
      adjacent to you. Items created this way are permanent, but subject to
      natural forces. Lava cools and hardens into stone over the course of a
      day, etc.</p><ul><li><p>A number of obsidian daggers equal to your
      proficiency bonus.</p></li><li><p>A crude raft made of pumice (large
      enough for you and two other creatures of medium size or
      smaller)</p></li><li><p>A 5-foot wide and 10-foot tall pillar of basalt.
      If created in your space, you are lifted by the pillar. Otherwise, it must
      be created on an empty space of solid ground.</p></li><li><p>A number of
      5-foot squares of lava equal to your proficiency bonus.They need not all
      be adjacent to you, but they must each border at least one other square of
      lava (created by this ability or another source) along one side, and must
      be created across natural solid ground. If not connected to another lava
      source, the lava hardens into stone over the course of 24
      hours.</p></li></ul>
