      <p dir="ltr">You can use the wind to throw your voice and create auditory
      illusions at a range of 120 ft. You can also modify your voice, changing
      its pitch to disguise it. Any attempts to recognize you by your voice must
      succeed on an Insight check against your elementalist spell save DC, and a
      Perception check or Wisdom saving throw can recognize the sounds as
      illusory projections.</p>
