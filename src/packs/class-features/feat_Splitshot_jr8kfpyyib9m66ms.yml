      dir="ltr">Also at 5th level, you&rsquo;re able to split the arcane power
      of your cantrips across multiple arrows. When you use your arcane
      ammunition class feature with a cantrip that deals more than one die of
      damage you may split the damage to make attacks against multiple
      targets.</p><p>For example a 5th level spellslinger using Firebolt can
      split the attack to deal 1d10 fire damage to one target and 1d10 fire
      damage to a second target by making two attack rolls.</p>
