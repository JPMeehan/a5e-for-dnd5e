      <p>At 6th level, while you are raging, your teeth elongate and strengthen
      into powerful fangs. You gain a melee bite attack that deals 1d4 + your
      Strength modifier piercing damage and 1d4 of the damage type done by your
      Breath Weapon. You are proficient with this attack, it has a reach of 5
      feet, and you use Strength for its attack roll. When you take the Attack
      action, you may attack with this bite as a bonus action.</p>
