      <blockquote><p>You undergo a hardening of your
      soul.</p></blockquote><p>Your soul cannot be trapped, imprisoned, or
      destroyed. Any effects that would normally do one of these things simply
      fail. When you die, your soul goes directly and immediately to its final
      judgment, preventing <em>Speak with Dead</em> from functioning on your
      corpse. If you are returned to life with the <em>Reincarnate</em> spell,
      you return as the same individual you were before the spell was cast, down
      to scars, tattoos, and other distinguishing marks.&nbsp;</p>
