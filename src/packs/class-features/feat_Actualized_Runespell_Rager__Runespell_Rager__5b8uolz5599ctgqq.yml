      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Berserk Rager:</strong>&nbsp;Whenever you cast a
      spell with a casting time of an action or bonus action that requires
      concentration, you may simultaneously enter a rage. In addition, if that
      spell requires your action to activate each turn, you may make a single
      attack with your runescar weapon after activating the spell.<br>Finally,
      you regain 1 spell point whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon
      that qualifies for Furious Critical.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Eldritch Rager:</strong>&nbsp;While raging, your
      spell save DC increases by 1. In addition, the damage that you deal with
      spells that require concentration is increased by an amount equal to your
      Constitution ability modifier.</p>
