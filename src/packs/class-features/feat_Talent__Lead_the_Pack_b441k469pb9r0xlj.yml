      <p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>Your unfaltering actions inspire
      your teammates to greater efforts. You gain an expertise die on Athletics
      or Acrobatics checks made to climb, jump, run, and swim. When your party
      makes a group Athletics or Acrobatics check, you may apply the results of
      your roll to yourself and one ally. You can choose which&nbsp;ally to
      apply your result to after everyone has rolled, but must do so before the
      Narrator says whether you succeed or fail.</p>
