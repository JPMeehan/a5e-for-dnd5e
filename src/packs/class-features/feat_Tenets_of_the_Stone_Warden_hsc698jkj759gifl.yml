      <p>All stone wardens hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Enduring Stone</strong>. Those you defend must be able to
      trust in your resilience.</li>

      <li><strong>Stable as Stone.</strong> You must be consistent, dependable,
      and fair in your dealings. Let no hint of caprice or pique cloud your
      judgment, but cleave to what is right.</li>

      <li><strong>Strong as Stone.</strong> You must be willing to shoulder far
      more than your &ldquo;share&rdquo; to walk this path.</li>

      <li><strong>Will of Stone, Not Heart of Stone.</strong> You must be
      incorruptible, implacable, and uncompromising, but this must be tempered
      with empathy and compassion. Strength without goodness is worse than
      weakness.</li>

      </ul>
