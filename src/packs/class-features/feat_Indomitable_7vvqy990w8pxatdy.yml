      reactions:</p><ul><li>Reroll a failed saving throw. If you do so, you must
      use the new roll.</li><li>Reduce the damage you would take from a single
      source or attack by 2d8 + half your fighter level.</li><li>Make a single
      attack against a creature that has just completed an attack against
      you.</li></ul><p>You gain an additional use of this feature at 13th level
      and a third use starting at 17th leveI. You regain all spent uses of this
      feature whenever you finish a long rest.</p>
