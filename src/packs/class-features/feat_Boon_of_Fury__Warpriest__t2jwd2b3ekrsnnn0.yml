      <p>Beginning at 8th level, your weapon attacks deal extra damage equal to
      your  Wisdom modifier. In addition, you can infuse divine power into a
      weapon attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage. Once you have used this
      feature to infuse divine power a number of times equal to your Wisdom
      modifier, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
