      <p>At 9th level, you learn to make quick fortifications and traps to
      facilitate your operations. You may spend 10 minutes to do any of the
      following:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p><strong>Secure a Door:</strong> You make a door especially durable and
      difficult to breach. The door gains additional hit points equal to your
      level, and the strength DC to force it open increases to match your spell
      save DC.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p><strong>Proximity Mine:</strong> You rig up a quick technomagical
      explosive that goes off when a creature other than you approaches to
      within 10 feet of it. Creatures in the blast radius must make a Dexterity
      save against your spell save DC or take an amount of thunder or fire
      damage (choose when you make the mine) equal to 1d4 times half your
      artificer level. Once the mine is triggered, it is destroyed.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p><strong>Barricade:</strong> You construct a fortified position 10 feet
      wide and 5 feet tall, topped with spikes, broken glass, or similar. It has
      hit points equal to 10 x your proficiency bonus, an AC equal to your spell
      save DC, and creatures attempting to cross it make their athletics checks
      to jump or climb over it with disadvantage, taking piercing or slashing
      damage equal to half your artificer level on a failed check. When standing
      behind the barricade, you either have 3/4ths cover or you can hunker down,
      forfeiting your ability to attack targets on the other side of the
      barricade and gaining full cover.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your
      proficiency bonus. You regain all uses of this feature when you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>
