      <p>The strength of the powers you serve is obvious to anybody you interact
      with, and you are able to use it to garner a certain level of fear and
      compliance. You gain one Intimidation specialty, and you gain an expertise
      die on Intimidation checks made to convince others to comply with your
      demands. The people you intimidate are no longer friendly towards you, if
      they were previously.</p>
