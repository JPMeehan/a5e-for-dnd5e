      <p>Also at 3rd level, you have trained to use magic to enhance your powers
      of observation, stealth, and combat. Dark eyes focus on spells that
      further augment their stealth, awareness, and observational
      reach.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>At 3rd level, you
      know two cantrips of your choice drawn from the wizard spell list. These
      spells count as rogue spells for you. You learn an additional cantrip at
      10th level.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Spell Slots</strong></h3><p>The Dark
      Eye Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
      expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Spells
      Known of 1st-Level or Higher</strong></h3><p>You know three 1st-level
      spells of your choice selected from the following schools: obscurement,
      scrying, senses, and shadow. The Spells Known column of the Dark Eye
      Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of your choice from
      this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have
      spell slots.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Additionally, when you gain a level in
      this class, you can choose one of the spells you know from this feature
      and replace it with another qualifying spell of a level for which you have
      spell slots.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Spellcasting
      Ability</strong></h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your
      spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your
      spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
      setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack
      roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><strong>Spell attack
      modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
      modifier</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Did We Forget
      Something?</strong></p><p>Especially observant readers may notice that the
      Dark Eye doesn’t get the full set of multiclass spells for the rogue class
      like the other tertiary casters in this volume. That is not an oversight.
      While there’s an archetype that gets access to the full set of multiclass
      spells for each of the traditionally non-casting classes available now* I
      didn’t want to set the precedent that it was <em>required</em> for
      tertiary casters to have access to those spells (even just for PMG
      products). After all,&nbsp; multiclass spells don't even exist in the
      <em>Adventurer’s Guide,</em> and the Wildborn ranger archetype is still
      plenty cool!<br><br>In the case of the Dark Eye, the free rogue multiclass
      spells aren’t quite as directly parallel to the flavor as they are to the
      Sacred Agent from <em>MoAR: Light &amp; Dark</em>. Dark Eyes are more
      spies and snipers than up-close fighters like the Sacred Agent (which owes
      a lot to a certain popular video game series based around different
      historical eras), so the very melee-oriented rogue multiclass spells
      didn’t fit. For Dark Eyes to get the rogue multiclass spells, they will
      need to multiclass.<br><br>*The ranger multiclass spell archetype is in
      Arcane Sniper, the marshal and rogue ones are in MoAR Light &amp; Dark,
      and the adept, berserker, and fighter archetypes are in this
      product.</p><p><br></p>
