      <p dir="ltr">By spending 10 minutes quietly meditating while in contact
      with a body of water, you can project your senses through the water to a
      distance of 1,000 ft, perceiving things happening near the water. You can
      focus your senses on one specific place at a time, as if you were there.
      While you are using this ability, you are unaware at your true
      location.</p>
