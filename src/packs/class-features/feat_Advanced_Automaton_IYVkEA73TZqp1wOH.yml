      <p>You further upgrade your automaton. Its AC increases to 15, its hit
      points increase to 50, and you add one of the following options:</p>

      <p><strong>Antitoxin Module: </strong>The automaton gains three charges
      which stack with the ones from Autonomous Medic (if applicable). It can
      spend a charge to neutralize one poison with a DC of 15 or lower in a
      creature it can touch. It regains all spent charges when you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Targeting Module: </strong>On its turn as an action, the
      automaton can highlight a target within 30 feet, granting an expertise die
      to creatures targeting it with attacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Flight Module: </strong>The automaton gains a fly speed of 40
      feet.</p>
