      <p>Your ability to prepare for the worst increases. You gain a free
      frugal, grade 1 Safe House stronghold in any city you visit. This safe
      house always counts as a haven, but it is temporary. If you visit a new
      city, you lose the previous safe house and acquire a new one.</p><p>If you
      wish, you may pay to make a stronghold acquired this way permanent. It has
      the normal cost for a stronghold of its size and type. If you do, it is
      not lost when you relocate to a different city.<br></p>
