      <p>Your bonded artifact is either glamored and disguised or otherwise
      appears mundane while not in active use. This guise can be seen through by
      making an Investigation check with a DC equal to 10 + your proficiency
      bonus + your spellcasting modifier, and it drops temporarily to reveal
      your artifact&rsquo;s powerful nature whenever you cast a wielder spell
      through it.</p>
