      <p>At 9th level, your experiences in combat teach you more about how to
      live in the world. Choose one of the following.</p>

      <h2>Provoking Attitude</h2>

      <p>You know how to piss people off. You can expend one use of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.htgvror5v9twusgs]{Rage}and
      choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear or see you. The creature
      makes a Charisma saving throw against your Furious Critical DC. On a
      failure, it makes or accepts a challenge. The nature of this challenge is
      at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion but is usually a duel or opposed check:
      archery with Dexterity, arm-wrestling with Strength, competing with a
      gaming set, distance running with Constitution, wrestling with Athletics,
      and so on.</p>

      <h2>Roaring Pause</h2>

      <p>When initiative is rolled you can expend one use of Rage to make an
      Intimidation check (DC 8 + number of creatures that rolled initiative) to
      briefly unveil the boundless fury within in a furious roar. On a success
      each creature stops what it is doing and can only make statements and a
      Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check on its turn. On a success by
      5 or more initiative is rerolled, and you choose a number of creatures
      equal to your Constitution modifier to gain advantage on their initiative
      roll.</p>

      <h2>Takes One To Know One</h2>

      <p>You know another warrior when you see one. When you see a creature, you
      know if it is proficient with more than simple weapons or has access to
      combat maneuvers.</p>
