      <p>At 4th level your experience as an expert survivalist manifests at the
      subconscious level. Choose one of the following options:</p><h3>Answering
      Silence</h3><p>When others seek your advice on wilderness matters, they
      often arrive at the correct conclusion despite (or perhaps because of) the
      silence with which you respond. When a friendly creature makes a Nature or
      Survival check while within 5 feet of you, it gains an expertise
      die.</p><h3>Fearsome Mysticism</h3><p>Your uncanny abilities and
      single-minded focus can be unnerving to the uninitiated. You gain an
      expertise die on Intimidation checks against any creature that is neither
      proficient in Arcana nor casts spells.&nbsp;</p><h3>Kindered
      Spirit</h3><p>You intuitively sense when another wilderness expert is
      nearby. Your passive Perception increases by 5 to detect hidden or
      invisible creatures within 30 feet of you, and you instantly detect
      whether any creature you can see is proficient with Stealth or
      Survival.</p>
