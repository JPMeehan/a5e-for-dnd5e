      <p>At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can increase all die sizes in one
      of your Battle Hymns by two steps (for example, from a d4 to a d8) for one
      minute to a maximum of a d12 for the duration of the battle hymn. Once you
      have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p><p>Additionally, you can spend a use of bardic inspiration
      as a bonus action to castbless or bane without using a spell slot.</p>
