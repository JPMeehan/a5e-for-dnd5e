      <p>When you know, you&nbsp;know, you know? When you fail an Arcana,
      History, Nature, or Religion check, you can attempt to draw on your magics
      to find an answer and reroll the check. On a failure, your attempt clouds
      your mind and you have disadvantage on Intelligence checks until you
      finish a short rest. While suffering this disadvantage, you canâ€™t use
      Ominous Insight again.</p>
