      <p>At 2nd level, you learn that your willpower is linked to the power of
      your artifact, and that you can draw from it or empower it. At the start
      of your turn you can spend any number of your bonded artifact&rsquo;s
      charges, if you do, you gain half that many exertion points (rounded down,
      up to a maximum equal to your exertion pool).</p>

      <p>Alternatively, at the start of your turn you can spend any number of
      exertion points, if you do, your bonded artifact regains half that many
      spent charges (rounded down, up to your artifact charges limit).</p>
