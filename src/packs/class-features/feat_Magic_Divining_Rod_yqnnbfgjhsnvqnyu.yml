      <p>Your artifact tends towards sources of powerful magic like a compass
      points towards the true north. As an action you can use your artifact as a
      magical divining rod, if you do, it points in the direction of the nearest
      powerful source of magic on the plane. Magical power sources that could
      draw your artifact include but are not limited to: spellcasters capable of
      performing 9th level spells, leyline convergences, artifact-tier magic
      items, gods, or ancient dragons.</p>
