      <p>When a creature attacks you, if it is not the first creature to attack
      you since the start of your last turn, you find an avenue of opportunity
      amid the massed assault. You can use this trick to impose disadvantage on
      that creatureâ€™s attack. Then, you gain advantage on the next attack roll
      you make before the end of your next turn that targets a creature that
      attacked you this round.</p>
