      <p>You have refined your elemental control. At a range of 120 ft., you can
      move up to a 5-ft-cube worth of elemental material up to 5-ft as an
      action; the type you can control is determined by your Elemental
      Affinities. You can make ability checks with your spellcasting ability
      modifier with proficiency in place of tool checks to shape the material,
      such as making sculptures of ice or stone, shapes of water and fire, or
      reform clouds. Sturdy material, such as ice or stone, retains its shape as
      normal, but air, fire, or water does not retain its shape if you do not
      spend an action each turn controlling it.</p>
