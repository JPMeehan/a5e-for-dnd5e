      <p>You continue to upgrade your armor, which gains an option based on its
      type:</p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Light Armor: </strong>The armor&rsquo;s stealth system
      improves. As a bonus action, you can become invisible until the beginning
      of your next turn. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal
      to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once) you can&rsquo;t do so again
      until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Medium Armor: </strong>The armor now includes a helmet
      with a protective breathing mask. You have advantage on saves against
      inhaled poisons and toxins and may hold your breath for an additional
      minute before you begin suffocating.</p>

      <p><strong>Advanced Heavy Armor: </strong>The armor includes a set of
      strength enhancers. When calculating what you can push, drag, or lift,
      your size is considered one step larger. This stacks with the Orc
      heritage&rsquo;s Heavy Lifter feature and similar features.</p>
