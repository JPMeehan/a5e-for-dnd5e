      <p>At 10th level you always have the banishment spell prepared and it
      doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of prepared spells.</p><p>If you
      cast <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">banishment</em> at 5th level
      or higher on a creature that is not on its native plane and it fails its
      save, the duration remains 1d4 + 2 rounds but the penalty on subsequent
      saving throws increases by 1 slot level above 4th. Such a creature that
      critically fails its initial saving throw against a <em
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">banishment</em> spell cast by you is
      permanently banished with no need to wait out the duration or maintain
      concentration, regardless of what level you cast it at.</p>
