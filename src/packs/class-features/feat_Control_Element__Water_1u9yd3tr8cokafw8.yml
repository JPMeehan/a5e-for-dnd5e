      dir="ltr">In addition to creating damaging blasts of elemental energy,
      elementalists are able to command and control elemental material at a
      distance. As an action, an elementalist can create effects at a range of
      30 feet, manipulating ambient elemental material to create any of the
      following effects. You must possess the proper elemental affinity to
      control an element.</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Elemental material weighing up to 5 lbs
      per elementalist level can be moved up to 30 feet.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Elemental material up to a cubic foot can
      be reshaped (such as ice or stone), using your power in place of any
      required tool proficiencies. Shapes can be made in amorphous elements
      (like air, fire, or water), but the shapes only hold for as long as you
      spend an action.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Water can be used to stop or change the
      flow of water in a 5-foot-cube, though the currents aren&rsquo;t fast
      enough to hurt anything. You can cause a 5-ft square section of ground to
      grow slick or icy, requiring Acrobatics checks against your spell save DC
      to move through at regular speed. You can freeze a 5-ft square section of
      water as long as there are no creatures in it; the water unfreezes after
      an hour. You can also provide water for a water breathing creature so that
      it can breathe for 1 minute in an environment it otherwise couldn&rsquo;t.
      Water can be used to perform the Knockdown or Shove maneuvers against
      targets near water, or to Grapple or Knockdown targets standing on the
      ground by coating the floor with ice.</p>
