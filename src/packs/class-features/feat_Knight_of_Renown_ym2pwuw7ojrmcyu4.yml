      <p>At 18th level, you have become a legendary knight,an almost mythical
      thing that is inspiring to see fighting alongside. The range of your
      Inspiring Charge is increased to 60 feet from 10 feet, and any of your
      allies that enter that area for the first time on their turn or begin
      their turn there gain inspiration. A creature can only gain inspiration in
      this way once between long rests.&nbsp;</p>
