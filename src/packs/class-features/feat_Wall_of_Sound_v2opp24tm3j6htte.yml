      <p>At 14th level, you gain the most potent sound sculptor ability: the
      creation of walls of sound. As an action, you can create a wall of solid
      sound. The wall is composed of twenty 5-foot-square, 10-foot-tall sections
      of solid sound. The sections must be contiguous, and all sections must be
      within 120 feet of your position; otherwise, you can form the wall in any
      shape you desire. The wall&rsquo;s space is&nbsp;difficult terrain</span>,
      and reverberations in the air make objects on the opposite side of the
      wall lightly obscured. Ranged attacks fired through the wall are made
      at&nbsp;disadvantage</span>&nbsp;. A creature that enters the wall&rsquo;s
      space for the first time on a turn or that starts its turn inside the wall
      must make a Constitution&nbsp;saving throw&nbsp;against your spell save
      DC. On a failed save, the target loses&nbsp;<span>concentration&nbsp;(if
      applicable) on any spell or effect they are concentrating on and is
      deafened for one minute. On a success, the target has disadvantage on
      Perception checks relying on hearing until it exits the section of wall,
      but is not deafened and does not lose concentration. You must concentrate
      to maintain the wall (as if concentrating on a spell), and it vanishes if
      you lose concentration. You can use this feature a number of times equal
      to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish
      a&nbsp;<span>long rest .</p>
