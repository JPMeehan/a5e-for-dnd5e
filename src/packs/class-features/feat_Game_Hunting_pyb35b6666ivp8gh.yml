      <p>At 6th level, you have advantage on any check made to locate or catch
      local game animals in the wild and gain the following
      features:</p><ul><li><p>You have proficiency with nets, and being within 5
      feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged
      attack rolls with a net.</p></li><li><p>You can use a 30-foot length of
      rope or strong vine as a lasso and try to grapple a creature within 20
      feet of you. As long as a creature is grappled by your lasso, it is also
      restrained. The lasso has AC 13 and 7 hit points. It is vulnerable to
      slashing damage and resistant to bludgeoning damage. If the lasso drops to
      0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p></li><li><p>When you use the Attack
      action and attack with a dual-wielding weapon, you can use a bonus action
      to attack with a net or use a lasso you are holding.</p></li></ul>
