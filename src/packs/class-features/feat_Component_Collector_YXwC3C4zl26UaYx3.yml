      dir="ltr">You have a nose for finding spell components. You have advantage
      on checks made to use the Gather Components journey activity. On a
      success, you also find additional components worth an amount of gold equal
      to you Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), or twice that amount on a
      critical success.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">(REMINDER: T&amp;T specifies that you can roll with
      disadvantage when Gathering Components to find a specific component
      you&rsquo;re looking for worth less than 100 gold.)</p>
