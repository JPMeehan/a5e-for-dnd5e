    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at level 6, you can use the flesh and bones of the slain to
      protect yourself. You may spend 10 minutes performing a ritual over a
      corpse of your size category or larger to craft a set of corpse armor onto
      yourself. This grants you a pool of temporary hit points equal to twice
      your berserker level. When you begin your Rage, you can opt either to end
      these temporary hit points early (shredding the armor as you do) or allow
      them to persist into your Rage (unlike normal temporary hit points). You
      do not benefit from Rage Hit Points while the Graven armor persists. If
      your Graven Armor temporary hit points are lost while raging, you gain
      your Rage Hit Points at the start of your next turn.</p><p>This feature
      comes with downsides. While you have temporary hit points from this
      feature, the stench of death hangs around you, giving you disadvantage on
      Persuasion and Deception checks. Attempts to find or track you by smell
      while you have temporary hit points from this feature are made with
      advantage.</p><p><br></p>
