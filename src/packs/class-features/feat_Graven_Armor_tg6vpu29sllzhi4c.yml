      <p>Beginning at level 6, you can use the flesh and bones of the slain to
      protect yourself. You may spend 10 minutes performing a ritual over a
      corpse of your size category or larger to craft a set of corpse armor onto
      yourself. This grants you a pool of temporary hit points equal to twice
      your berserker level. When you begin your Rage, you can opt either to end
      these temporary hit points early (shredding the armor as you do) or allow
      them to persist into your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.htgvror5v9twusgs]{Rage}
      (unlike normal temporary hit points). You do not benefit from Rage Hit
      Points while the Graven armor persists. If your Graven Armor temporary hit
      points are lost while raging, you gain your Rage Hit Points at the start
      of your next turn.</p>

      <p>This feature comes with downsides. While you have temporary hit points
      from this feature, the stench of death hangs around you, giving you
      disadvantage on Persuasion and Deception checks. Attempts to find or track
      you by smell while you have temporary hit points from this feature are
      made with advantage.</p>
