      <p>At 14th level, you can hamper the efforts of the unreal to affect the
      real. All friendly creatures within 30 feet of you become immune to the
      Charmed and Confused conditions and have advantage on saving throws
      against illusion spells and any effect that would deal psychic damage or
      inflict levels of strife.</p>
