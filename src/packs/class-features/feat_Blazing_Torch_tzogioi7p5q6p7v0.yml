      <p>Starting at 14th level, you&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to letting your
      artifact&rsquo;s power flow through you and around you. While in your
      torch bearer form you can maintain concentration on up to two wielder
      spells simultaneously so long as both spells have a range of self or have
      a range of touch and you target yourself.</p>
