      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn the recipe for a special injury poison
      called Blackblade. During a short or long rest, you can use your
      poisonerâ€™s kit to brew a number of doses of this poison equal to your
      proficiency bonus without spending money or resources doing so. These
      poisons lose their effectiveness at the start of your next short or long
      rest. </p><p>This poison can be applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition
      before combat or as a Cunning Action. The first time a poisoned weapon or
      ammunition deals damage, it deals an additional 3d6 poison damage.</p>
