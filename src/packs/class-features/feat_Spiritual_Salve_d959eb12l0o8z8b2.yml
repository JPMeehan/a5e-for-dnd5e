      <p>Your spiritual mindset has given you unique insights that can help you
      and your companions endure hardships. Your constant encouragements and
      proverbs allow allies within 30 feet of you to reroll a Constitution check
      or saving throw that they fail. If they do so, they must use the new roll.
      This feature cannot be used on saving throws made to maintain
      concentration on a spell. Once a creature has used your Spiritual Salve to
      make a reroll, it cannot do so again until it has finished a long
      rest.</p>
