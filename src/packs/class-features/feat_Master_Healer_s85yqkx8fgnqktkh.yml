      <p>At 18th level when spending 10 minutes to do more intensive treatment
      with Doctor&rsquo;s Hands, you may also expend a hit die to automatically
      roll max on the doctor dice. Doing so is taxing and grants a level of
      fatigue to the scholar, and a single creature cannot benefit from this
      intensive care more than once per long rest.</p>
