      <p>At 18th level your sense for danger reaches a&nbsp;preternatural level.
      Whenever you are forced to make&nbsp;a dexterity save against an area
      effect, you may use&nbsp;your reaction to move half your movement
      speed&nbsp;without provoking an attack of opportunity. If you&nbsp;end
      your movement outside of the affected area, you&nbsp;are unaffected. If
      you do not, you still have advantage&nbsp;on the save. Once you use this
      ability, you may not do&nbsp;so again until you finish a long rest unless
      you expend&nbsp;inspiration.</p>
