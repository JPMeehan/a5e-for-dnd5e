      <p>At 17th level, you can predict an enemyâ€™s tactics with enough precision
      to thwart them with ease. When you use Combat Deduction and succeed the
      Investigation check, until the end of your next turn you have advantage on
      attack rolls against that creature, it has disadvantage on attack rolls
      against you, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against your
      abilities, and you have advantage on saving throws against its
      abilities.</p>
