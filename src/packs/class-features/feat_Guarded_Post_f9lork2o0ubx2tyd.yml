      <p>Experience has taught you that defending others is often the key to
      survival. At 13th level choose one of the following
      options:</p><h3>Defensive Marksman</h3><p>When a hostile creature moves
      towards you or a companion, you can use your reaction to make a ranged
      weapon attack against it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Hunter's Blind</h3><p>You can spend
      10 minutes constructing a natural shelter able to accommodate yourself and
      up to 9 other creatures of Medium size or smaller. The shelter blends in
      with its surroundings, and as long as no one moves into or out of it, the
      shelter is indistinguishable from a natural object. It is designed to
      allow creatures inside to see out but prevent anyone outside from seeing
      in.&nbsp;</p><p>The shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the
      weather outside, and counts as a haven.</p>
