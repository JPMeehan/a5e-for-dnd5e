      <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-eb0e590e-7fff-bd8b-5bd9-f61500fe86db">You
      gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks made to solve riddles and
      puzzles. In addition, you can easily avoid speaking directly by cloaking
      your meaning in wordplay and allusions, allowing you to hide a short
      message within other speech or writing. Most creatures will take your
      words at face value, but suspicious creatures may make an Intelligence
      (Insight) check against your spell save DC to notice that you have hidden
      a message in your words. On a success of 5 or more, they also learn your
      hidden meaning. When you use this ability, you may include specific tells
      and points of reference in your riddlespeak to allow creatures you choose
      and with whom you are familiar to automatically succeed on the
      check.</span></p>
