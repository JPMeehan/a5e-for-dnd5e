      <p>You draw upon nature&rsquo;s power to become a prime example of one of
      its children. Whenever you assume a wild shape you may choose to assume
      the apex form of that wild shape. An apex form is one size category larger
      than the creature&rsquo;s normal size category (maximum Gargantuan) and
      any attack made by an apex form wild shape deals an extra 1d8 damage. In
      addition, while in an apex form wild shape you gain an expertise die on
      Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saving throws.</p>
