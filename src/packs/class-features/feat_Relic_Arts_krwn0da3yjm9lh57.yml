      <p>Either through strength of will, a growing familiarity, or even just
      accidentally pushing the right buttons, you&rsquo;ve unlocked a new
      utility of your bonded artifact. At 3rd level, you gain two relic arts of
      your choice. Your relic art options are detailed at the end of the class
      description. You gain an additional relic art of your choice at 7th level,
      11th level, 14th level, and 17th level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the relic arts you know and replace it with another relic art that you
      could learn at that level.</p>
