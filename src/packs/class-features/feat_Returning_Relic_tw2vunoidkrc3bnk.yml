      <p>Regardless of weight or aerodynamics your relic flies from your
      fingertips straight as an arrow and magically returns to them. Your weapon
      of power gains the thrown weapon quality with a range of 30/60. Whenever
      you make a thrown weapon attack using your weapon of power in this way it
      magically returns to your hand at the end of the attack. In addition, so
      long as your weapon of power is within 60 feet you can magically return it
      to your hand as a bonus action.</p>
