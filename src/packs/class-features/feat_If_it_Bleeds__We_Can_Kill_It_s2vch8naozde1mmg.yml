      <p>At 7th level, you spur your teammates to bring down the most dangerous
      foes, one little bit at a time. Choose one of the following options:
      </p><h3><strong>No Quarter</strong></h3><p>If a creature is bloodied,
      weapon attacks from you and friendly creatures within the range of your
      Commanding Presence ability do additional damage to it equal to your
      Charisma modifier.</p><h3><strong>No Mercy</strong></h3><p>Whenever you or
      a friendly creature within the range of your Commanding Presence makes a
      successful weapon attack against a creature that has been marked with your
      Mark Foe feature, the attack deals 1d4 ongoing damage for one minute or
      until the creature or one of its allies spends an action to stanch the
      wound. A target can only suffer one instance of this ability from any
      given creature at a time. Multiple hits from the same creature reset the
      duration of the ongoing damage, but do not increase the amount of it.</p>
