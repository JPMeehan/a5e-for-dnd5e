      <p>At 17th level, you can spend an action to so utterly cut to the core of
      a personâ€™s identity that for a moment they might lose the will to live.
      One creature that can understand you is stunned . At the end of each of
      its turns it must make a Charisma saving throw against your trick DC or
      else it gains a level of strife . The effect ends when it succeeds one of
      these saving throws, or when it has six levels of strife.</p><p>Once you
      use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use
      it again.</p>
