      <p>At level 10, you develop a certain "quick and dirty" knowledge of
      herbalism and alchemy that you can use in a pinch. As long as you are in
      natural surroundings (such as a forest or a cave), you can spend an hour
      to create any consumable item (such as a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.yla4i7uz4h58mfqb]{Healing Potion
      (Basic)} or a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.ukcav3i8dudpalir]{Tanglefoot
      Bag}) that costs 100 gold or less. At any given time, you may only have a
      number of these items equal to your Intelligence modifier in existence at
      once, and they only last for 8 hours before losing potency.</p>
