      <p dir="ltr">At 7th level, you can choose to overcharge a Leyline Master
      spell you know as you cast it, treating the spell as if you had cast it
      with a spell slot one higher than the one you actually used, to a maximum
      effective spell level of 9. Once you have used this feature, you
      can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
