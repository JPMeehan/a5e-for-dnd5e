      dir="ltr">At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the
      ability to see in the dark. You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet if
      you do not have it, or add 60 feet to the range of your existing
      darkvision if you do. At 3rd level, the range of your darkvision increases
      by a further 30 feet, and at 10th level, your darkvision treats magical
      darkness as normal darkness.</p>
