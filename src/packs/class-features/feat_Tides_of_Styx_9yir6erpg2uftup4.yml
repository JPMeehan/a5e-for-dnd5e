      <p>Beginning at 17th level, you can twist ambient life force emitted by
      the dying to the benefit of your allies… or to yourself alone. When a
      creature you can see of CR 1 or higher dies within 120 feet of you, you or
      a friendly creature you can see within that range regains hit points equal
      to 1d6 per that creature’s CR (minimum of 1d6). (Creatures who use
      character level instead of CR are treated as having CR equal to their
      level.)</p>
