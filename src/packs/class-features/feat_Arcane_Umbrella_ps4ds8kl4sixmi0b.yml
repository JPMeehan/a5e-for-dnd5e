      <p>At 6th level, your magical connection to the natural world protects you
      from many hazards. Non-magical precipitation of any kind (from soft rain
      or snow all the way to damaging hail) does not land on you unless you
      deliberately permit it. You have advantage on saving throws against
      natural hazards and spells from the <em>nature </em>school, and you
      automatically succeed on saving throws made to resist the effects of hot
      or cold weather.</p>
