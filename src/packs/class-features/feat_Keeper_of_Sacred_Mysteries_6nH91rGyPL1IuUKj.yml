      <p dir="ltr">Your religious training or practice includes producing
      beautiful calligraphy and illuminations of sacred texts, but also the
      heavy responsibility of hiding the secrets of your faith in those same
      texts. You gain proficiency with calligrapher&rsquo;s tools.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, when writing religious texts you can encode
      hidden meanings or messages into the text. The apparent text (which
      usually contains more standard religious instruction and wisdom) must be
      at least four times longer than the hidden message.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Other creatures who are strongly affiliated with your faith
      such as other clerics of the same tradition or the supernatural servants
      of your higher power can find and read the message automatically with no
      check required, and you can do the same with similarly-hidden wisdom or
      messages from them.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Creatures from outside your faith or tradition can spend a
      minute to make a Religion check against your spell save DC to detect the
      presence of a hidden message, and are able to read the hidden message if
      they succeed by 5 or more.</p>
