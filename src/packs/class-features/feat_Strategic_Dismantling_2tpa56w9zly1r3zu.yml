      <p>While you may have no special talent for detecting traps, you and your
      tools can definitely deal with them once they&rsquo;ve been pointed out.
      You gain the Engineering skill specialty mechanical traps. In addition, if
      you trigger a trap while attempting to disarm it, you gain advantage on
      any saving throws made to avoid it.</p>
