      <p>At 15th level, you and your allies can turn the tide against greatly
      superior forces. Choose one of the following options:</p><h3><strong>Last
      Stand</strong></h3><p>As a bonus action, you can declare a last stand,
      which lasts for 10 minutes. While your Last Stand is active, for each
      allied creature within the range of your Commanding Presence ability that
      is at 0 hp, you and any friendly creatures within the same area gain a +1
      bonus to damage with weapon attacks. These bonuses stack, but the maximum
      bonus you can receive is equal to your proficiency bonus. If one of the
      creatures is revived, the bonus to damage decreases, but you and allied
      creatures in the area gain temporary hp equal to your proficiency bonus.
      Once you have used this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a
      long rest.</p><h3><strong>No Retreat</strong></h3><p>As a bonus action,
      you can declare No Retreat which lasts for 10 minutes. When you do, you
      and friendly creatures within the range of your Commanding Presence become
      immune to the frightened, confused, stunned, and paralyzed conditions as
      long as one other friendly creature is conscious and within range. Your
      Commanding Presence range still applies if you fall unconscious or even
      die for the purposes of this ability only. If a creature becomes the last
      one of its allies standing from its group of allies while this feature is
      active, it is immediately healed to full hit points and loses immunity to
      the frightened, confused, stunned, and paralyzed conditions, but gains
      advantage on saving throws against them instead. If another creature is
      revived from the group, the condition immunity returns. If any additional
      creatures become the last one standing after the first, they are only
      healed to half hit points, not full. Once you have used this ability, you
      can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
