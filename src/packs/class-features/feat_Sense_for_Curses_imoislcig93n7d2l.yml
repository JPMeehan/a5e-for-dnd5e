      dir="ltr">Your extensive time under the burden of your bonded artifact has
      given you an unusually good sense for curse magic. You can perform a
      one-hour ritual over a magic item and then make a Charisma check with a DC
      of 7 for a common item, 10 for an uncommon item, 13 for a rare item, 16
      for a rare item, or 19 for a legendary item, adding your proficiency bonus
      to the roll. You cannot use this feature on artifacts. On a success, you
      learn whether the item is cursed or not. On a failure, you are unable to
      untangle the item&rsquo;s magic and learn nothing (but are aware of the
      failure). You can try again with the same item, but must wait a week
      between attempts.&nbsp;</p>
