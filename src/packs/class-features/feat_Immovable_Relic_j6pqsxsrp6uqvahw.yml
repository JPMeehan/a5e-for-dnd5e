      <p>Your artifact is bonded to you and stubbornly refuses to budge for
      other creatures. Other creatures find that your bonded artifact is fixed
      magically in place when they attempt to interact with it. Your bonded
      artifact obeys the laws of gravity but otherwise can hold up to 8,000
      pounds of weight. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength
      check, moving your bonded artifact up to 10 feet on a success.</p>
