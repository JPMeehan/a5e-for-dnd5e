      <p>All penitents hold similar tenets, regardless of any master they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Atonement. </strong>You can&rsquo;t undo the past, but that
      does not mean you cannot put a lot of good into the world to balance
      it.</li>

      <li><strong>Forgiveness</strong>. If you can fall, so can others. If you
      can be better, so can others. Never forget this. Never ignore it.</li>

      <li><strong>Compassion.</strong> You know better than most what can happen
      when people are at their worst. Strive to create circumstances where they
      can be at their best instead.</li>

      <li><strong>Wisdom.</strong> Sometimes the cost of saving someone will be
      too high. Do not sacrifice the lives and safety of innocents in an attempt
      to sway the truly wicked.</li>

      </ul>
