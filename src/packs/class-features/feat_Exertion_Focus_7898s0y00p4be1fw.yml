      <p>At 2nd level, your training allows you to harness your mental energy
      into a supernatural state of focus. Some cultures refer to this energy as
      ax&eacute;, prana, pneuma, or ki. Your access to this energy is
      represented by your exertion pool. You can spend exertion points to fuel
      various focus features.</p>

      <p>You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Long Step, and
      Patient Defense. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this
      class.</p>

      <p>Some of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw
      to resist the feature&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated
      as follows:</p>

      <p><strong>Focus save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Wisdom modifier</p>
