      <p>You can consume things that most people wouldn’t consider sustenance,
      though it’s hardly pleasant. You can spend 3 sorcery points before eating
      a pound of just about anything organic — bark, grass, cactus flesh, bone,
      whatever’s at hand—and so long as you can stomach the taste, it counts as
      1 Supply for you as your body transmutes it into something more edible. A
      poisonous substance consumed in this way is still poisonous.</p>
