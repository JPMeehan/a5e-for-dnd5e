      <p>At 14th level you’ve learned how to ingratiate yourself into a
      community or tie yourself to the magic of the land. As a series of rituals
      requiring 24 hours of uninterrupted work, you can take root in a specific
      community such as a village, city, or commune, or a place of magical
      importance such as a temple, revered grove, or convergence of leylines.
      You may cast the spell <strong>Transport</strong> <strong>via Plants
      </strong>to travel to the place you’ve taken root without expending a
      spell slot. In addition, while within a mile of the place you’ve taken
      root, you may cast the spell <strong>Tree Stride </strong>without
      expending a spell slot. </p><p>These effects end when you attempt to take
      root in a new location.</p>
