      <p>When you cast a spell of 5th-level or lower, you can spend sorcery
      points equal to the sorcery point conversion cost for a spell slot of that
      level (see Table: Creating Spell Slots). The spell repeats on the next
      turn, originating from the same point and aimed at the same target as the
      first instance of the spell.</p>
