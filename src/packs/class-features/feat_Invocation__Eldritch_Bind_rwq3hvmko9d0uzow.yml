      <p>When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Whip, you can force it to
      make a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end
      of each of its turns, the paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw,
      ending the effect on a success.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you
      cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You also regain
      the use of this feature after you&rsquo;ve spent 5 spell points to cast a
      spell or use other warlock features.</p>
