      <p>At 6th level, choose one option from the following:</p>

      <h2>Displaced Death</h2>

      <p>Through intensive prayer or symbolic rites, you can divert ill fates.
      When you or a friendly creature within 30 feet fails a death saving throw,
      you can use this feature to strike that failure from the record (even if
      you are unconscious). Once you have used this feature a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      complete a long rest.</p>

      <h2>Piercing Darkness</h2>

      <p>Necrotic damage you deal ignores resistance. When you reach 12th level,
      you treat creatures which ordinarily have immunity to necrotic damage as
      only having resistance. At 18th level, you ignore immunity to necrotic
      damage.</p>
