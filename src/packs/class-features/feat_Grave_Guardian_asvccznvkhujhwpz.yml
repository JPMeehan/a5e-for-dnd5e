      <p>At 6th level, choose one option from the
      following:</p><p></p><h4><strong>Displaced Death</strong></h4><p>Through
      intensive prayer or symbolic rites, you can divert ill fates. When you or
      a friendly creature within 30 feet fails a death saving throw, you can use
      this feature to strike that failure from the record (even if you are
      unconscious). Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to
      your proficiency bonus, you canâ€™t use it again until you complete a long
      rest.</p><h4><strong>Piercing Darkness</strong></h4><p>Necrotic damage you
      deal ignores resistance. When you reach 12th level, you treat creatures
      which ordinarily have immunity to necrotic damage as only having
      resistance. At 18th level, you ignore immunity to necrotic
      damage.</p><p><br></p>
