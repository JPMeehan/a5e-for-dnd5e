      <p>Also at 3rd level, you are always ready to wield your magic at the drop
      of a hat. When initiative is rolled, as long as you are not surprised you
      can choose to cast a spell with a vocalized component and casting time of
      1 action. If you do so, the effects of the spell occur at the start of the
      first creatureâ€™s turn, and on your first turn you do not receive an
      action.</p>
