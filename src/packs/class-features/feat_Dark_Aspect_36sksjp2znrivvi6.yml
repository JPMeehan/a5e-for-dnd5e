      <p>Also at 15th level, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already
      have darkvision, its range extends by 60 feet instead. In addition to the
      normal benefits, you can see through magical darkness as if it were dim
      light.  Additionally, as an action, you may drop the light level within 30
      feet of you by one step for up to 10 minutes. Bright light becomes dim
      light, dim light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes magical darkness.
      Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
