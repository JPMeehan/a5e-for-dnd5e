      <p>You easily fit in wherever you go. You gain proficiency with Stealth.
      If you are already proficient with Stealth, you instead gain an expertise
      die. In addition, in any urban environment, such as a city estate, guard
      barracks, or guild hall, people just assume you belong, and so you
      automatically succeed on any check to impersonate a basic worker, servant,
      or low level member of an organization and are granted any privileges and
      access such a person would have unless there is an obvious reason you
      don&rsquo;t belong (such as being the wrong creature type or the
      organization being so small that everyone knows each other by name).</p>
