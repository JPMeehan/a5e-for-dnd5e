      <p>Beginning at 9th level, you learn the Virulent Stance maneuver and you
      are always under its effects. It does not count as an active stance for
      you, does not cost exertion, and affects any poison you use, not just
      named ones. If you already had the Virulent Stance maneuver, you may
      select another Viperâ€™s Fangs maneuver in its place.</p><p>If you would
      deal poison damage, you can choose to do acid or necrotic damage
      instead.</p>
