      <p>Starting at 6th level, when you kill a creature targeted by your
      Diabolical Curse or under the effects of one of your warlock spells, you
      can bid your patron conjure into your service either a death dog or a
      ghoul (your choice) into an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The creature
      rolls its own initiative, has its own turns, and obeys your verbal
      commands. The creature disappears after 1 minute, when you are knocked
      unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>At 15th level,
      you can have your patron conjure for you either a hell hound or a wight
      instead.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again
      until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
