      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You gain resistance
      to necrotic and radiant damage, your hit point maximum cannot be reduced,
      and whenever you are healed by a spell, it heals you an additional amount
      equal to the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In addition, if you
      would damage an undead creature with a spell or ability that deals
      necrotic damage, you may instead choose to heal it for the same
      amount.</p>
