      <p>You gain an expertise die on poisoner’s kit checks. With 10 minutes of
      experimentation you can identify a dose of a poison and learn the recipe
      to make it. You can use your poisoner’s kit and spend a day creating the
      poison for half its cost. At the Narrator’s discretion, you may be able to
      learn the recipe for poisons which don’t appear in Chapter 7: Maladies in
      Trials &amp; Treasures.</p>
