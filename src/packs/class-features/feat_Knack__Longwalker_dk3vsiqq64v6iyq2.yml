      <p>When you would gain a level of fatigue due to lack of Supply during a
      journey, you do not gain that level of fatigue. Alternatively, you can
      choose to accept the level of fatigue, allowing up to two traveling
      companions to forgo gaining a level of fatigue instead. Once you have used
      this feature, you cannot do so again for a week.</p>
