    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level whenever you cast a spell that deals force, bludgeoning,
      acid, or cold damage that requires a saving throw, if the creature fails
      the save they are either pushed 10 feet away from you or knocked prone,
      your choice. If the spell instead requires a spell attack roll, you can
      force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your wizard spell
      DC or suffer the same. Using this ability on a spell causes the spell to
      benefit from Inescapable Current. You can do so a number of times equal to
      your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long
      rest.</p>
