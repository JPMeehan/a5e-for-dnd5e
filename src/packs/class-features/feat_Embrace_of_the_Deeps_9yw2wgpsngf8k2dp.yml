      <p>At 10th level you gain resistance to your choice of lightning, cold, or
      acid damage, and can change which type whenever you finish a short or long
      rest. &nbsp;In addition, whenever you finish a long rest you are
      surrounded by a thin shield of water that absorbs incoming damage,
      granting you temporary hit points equal to your witch level + your
      spellcasting ability modifier.<br>Finally, when you cast the free
      Amphibious alter self spell granted by Annointed by the Waves, it no
      longer requires concentration.</p>
