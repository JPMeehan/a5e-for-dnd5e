      <p>You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. You can invent ciphers,
      and are able to teach a cipher to others. Anyone who knows a cipher can
      encode and read hidden messages made with it; the apparent text must be at
      least four times longer than the hidden message. Other creatures can spend
      a minute to make an Investigation check (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Intelligence modifier) to detect the presence of a cipher, and are
      able to read the hidden message if they succeed by 5 or
      more.</p><p>Additionally, you have advantage on Investigation checks made
      to detect and decode ciphers and codes.</p>
