      <p>Beginning at 4th level, you are skilled at hiding your motives. Choose
      one of the following options. You must be proficient in a skill or tool to
      gain an expertise die from Innocent
      Facade.</p><h3><strong>Cipher</strong></h3><p>You gain an expertise die on
      Deception checks. You can invent ciphers, and are able to teach a cipher
      to others. Anyone who knows a cipher can encode and read hidden messages
      made with it; the apparent text must be at least four times longer than
      the hidden message. Other creatures can spend a minute to make an
      Investigation check (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
      modifier) to detect the presence of a cipher, and are able to read the
      hidden message if they succeed by 5 or more. Additionally, you have
      advantage on Investigation checks made to detect and decode ciphers and
      codes.</p>
