      <p>This armed alchemical grenade explodes when it hits a target or at the
      end of your turn.</p><p>Whenever you hit a target with an alchemical
      grenade, each creature within 5 feet of the target makes a Dexterity
      saving throw or takes half as much damage as taken by the target (the
      target is immune to this effect). Whenever you miss with an armed
      alchemical grenade it explodes in a harmless location at the end of your
      turn.</p><h3><strong>Acid Core</strong></h3><p>A target hit by this
      grenade takes an additional ongoing acid damage that persists until it
      submerges itself in water or uses an action to wipe the acid off. </p>
