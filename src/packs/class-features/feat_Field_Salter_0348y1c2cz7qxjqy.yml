      <p>At 10th level, your connection to undeath allows you to forcibly tear
      the life from the earth. Once a month, you can perform a special ritual
      requiring you to take 2 levels of fatigue and 2 levels of strife and 8
      hours of uninterrupted work to blight a wide swath of territory. Upon the
      successful completion of the ritual, all of the vegetation and creatures
      weighing less than 5 pounds within a 5-mile radius immediately die and
      begin decomposing into putrid, toxic ichor. Creatures weighing more than 5
      pounds must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC or gain a
      level of fatigue. Nothing will grow in this area again for a year unless
      it is ritually purified, which takes a 100gp of reagents and a month of
      8-hour days of ritual work from trained spellcasters per affected square
      mile. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, other methods such as divine
      intervention, the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.r6eshb9jaeqc70mp]{Hallow}<em>&nbsp;</em>spell,
      or similar means may also be able to end the curse.</p>
