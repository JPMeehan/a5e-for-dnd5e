      dir="ltr">At 14th level, in response to another creature's movement or
      action, as a reaction you can direct up to 2 friendly creatures (one of
      which can be you) to take the Dash action or make a single weapon attack
      with no action required. Once you have used this feature a number of times
      equal to your Intelligence modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
