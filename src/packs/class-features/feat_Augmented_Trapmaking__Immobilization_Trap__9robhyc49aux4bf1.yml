      <p>At 9th level, you invent a new way to increase the danger posed by your
      traps. You learn one of the following trap capabilities. When using
      Trapmaking to create a trap, you can choose to augment it with the new
      capability, which is triggered when your trap damages a
      creature.</p><h3><strong>Immobilization Trap</strong></h3><p>The target is
      caught in the jaws of a trap. The targetâ€™s movement speed is reduced to 0.
      A creature can use an action or legendary action to make a DC 13 Strength
      check, freeing itself or another creature on a success. Building this trap
      requires a hunting trap, which can be recovered after the trap is
      triggered.</p>
