      <p>At 6th level your power grows as your altered physiology adapts to the
      life you&rsquo;ve led up to this point. You may choose one of the
      following abilities and are not bound by your flesh and bone
      selection.</p>

      <p><strong>Stone Eye</strong>: You may attempt to petrify a creature of
      your choosing within 60ft simply by meeting their gaze. As a bonus action
      on your turn you force the target to make a Constitution save against your
      spell save DC. On a failed save the target is Restrained or Petrified
      instead if they rolled a natural 1. At the end of their next turn
      restrained targets must make a second Constitution save, becoming
      Petrified on a failure. This petrification lasts for 1 minute and you may
      use it once per short rest, or expend two sorcery points as a bonus action
      to recover it.</p>

      <p>In addition, if you possess the baleful gaze bonded power the effect
      does not end at the start of the creature&rsquo;s next turn. Instead they
      must make Constitution saves at the beginning of their turn to end the
      effect, and it lasts a maximum of 3 turns.</p>
