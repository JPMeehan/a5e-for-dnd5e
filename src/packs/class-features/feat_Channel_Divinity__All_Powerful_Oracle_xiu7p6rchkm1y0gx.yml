      <p>Beginning at 17th level, your ability to see from the perspective of
      another using
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.s4iiatrup3e3virw]{Channel
      Divinity} reaches its ultimate form. When using this feature, you become
      blinded and deafened to your surroundings for up to a number of minutes
      equal to your Wisdom modifier, sensing instead through a creature you
      name. As long as the creature is alive and on the same plane of existence,
      it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see and hear
      everything the creature sees and hears.</p>

      <p>In addition, you are also able to access all of the creature&rsquo;s
      memories and knowledge related to a single object, place, person, or
      subject. The subject and place must be somewhat specific (you may not
      simply access their knowledge of &ldquo;history&rdquo; for example, but
      you may access their knowledge on &ldquo;the history of dragons&rsquo;
      uses in warfare&rdquo;.) Similarly, you may gain their knowledge of a
      single city, building, or 5-mile-square patch of wilderness, but not an
      entire continent or region.</p>

      <p>You cannot see through the eyes of a blinded creature, or hear through
      the ears of a deafened creature. If the creature is dead or protected from
      divination magic this feature has no effect. An unconscious creature
      automatically fails its saving throw and you may hear what it hears and
      access its knowledge. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this
      feature for 24 hours.</p>
