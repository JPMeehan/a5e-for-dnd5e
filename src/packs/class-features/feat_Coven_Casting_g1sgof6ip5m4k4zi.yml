      <p>You may link two other creatures while ritual casting. When the three
      of you work together tto ritually cast a spell that any of you are capable
      of ritually casting, you may upcast the spell to the highest level
      available to you. All three participants must be involved for the entire
      casting as if tthey were individually performing the ritual, and it takes
      the full casting time + 10 minutes, unless all participants have an
      ability that reduces ritual casting time.</p>
