      <p dir="ltr">Also at 17th level, when you finish a long rest, you can
      spend a use of channel divinity to imbue a number of allies equal to your
      Wisdom modifier with divine power. For each affected creature, choose a
      cantrip you know and three 1st-level spells you know. None of the affected
      spells can do damage or impose conditions or other harmful effects. A
      chosen creature can use the granted cantrip at will as if they knew it
      normally and can use any combination of the three granted spells a total
      of three times. Creatures may use their choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma as their spellcasting ability for the granted spells. The
      imbuement ends when you begin a long rest.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>!Foundry
