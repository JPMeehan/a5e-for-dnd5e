      <p>At 17th level, you are able to manipulate the burning brilliance of the
      stars themselves. Choose an object or creature within 60 feet. For 1
      minute the target emits bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for
      an additional 30 feet. When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of
      the target or first enters into a space within 30 feet of the target on
      its turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1
      minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
      of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>The first
      time this feature is used per long rest, any creature within 30 feet of
      the target takes 12d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half damage on a
      success. Magical auras within the light’s radius become visible for 1
      hour, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 hour. An invisible
      creature that fails its saving throw against the radiant damage is also
      revealed and it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 hour. </p>
