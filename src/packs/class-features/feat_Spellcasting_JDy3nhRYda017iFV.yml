      <p>Also at 3rd level, your arcane study grants you the ability to cast
      spells. Arcane Snipers learn magic as a tool to augment their ranged
      combat abilities and also their general versatility.</p>

      <h2>Cantrips</h2>

      <p>At 3rd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the movement,
      obscurement, senses or weaponry schools. These spells count as ranger
      spells for you. You learn an additional cantrip at 10th level.</p>

      <h2>Spell Slots</h2>

      <p>The Arcane Sniper Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you
      have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these
      spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You
      regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h2>Spells Known of 3rd-Level and Higher</h2>

      <p>You know one 1st-level spell of your choice from the movement school
      and two more from the movement, or obscurement, senses, or weaponry
      schools. The Spells Known column of the Arcane Sniper Spellcasting table
      shows when you learn more spells of your choice from this feature. Each of
      these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the spells you know from this feature and replace it with another
      qualifying spell of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

      <h2>Spellcasting Ability</h2>

      <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your
      Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
      addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw
      DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Intelligence modifier</p>

      <p><strong>Spell attack modifie</strong>r = your proficiency bonus + your
      Intelligence modifier</p>
