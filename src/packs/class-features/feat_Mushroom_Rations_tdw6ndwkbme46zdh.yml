      <p>Also at 2nd level, you learn to sprout edible mushrooms from any nearby
      organic material. As an action, as long as there is some dead organic
      material weighing at least 10 pounds around (including soil, bodies,
      wooden furniture or tools, etc.) you may spend a use of Wild Shape to
      create a number of edible mushrooms equal to your proficiency bonus. The
      mushrooms only stay nutritious for a day, but each counts as a unit of
      Supply and grants a creature that eats it resistance to poison damage and
      immunity to the poisoned condition for 8 hours.</p>
