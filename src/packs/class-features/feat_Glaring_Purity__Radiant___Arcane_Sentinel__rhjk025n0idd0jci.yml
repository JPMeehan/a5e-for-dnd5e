      <p>When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals radiant damage
      or make a weapon attack that deals radiant damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
      point to cause the target to become outlined in light. It sheds bright
      light in a 10-foot radius and dim light in a 20-foot one, cannot benefit
      from invisibility or other obscuring effects such as displacement or blur
      and cannot hide. The light lasts for one minute.</p>
