      <p>When you make a check using a lore skill to recall information about a
      creature that is of a type you could detect with your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.01szspr1nunp0lql]{Divine
      Sense}, you are always treated as proficient with a relevant skill. If you
      are already proficient with a skill that could be used to discover or
      learn information about the creature, you gain advantage on the check
      instead.</p>
