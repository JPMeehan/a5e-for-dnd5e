    value: >-
      <p>Choose one of the following types of attire: wearing clothing entirely
      of a single colour (clothes that are stained, muddied, bloodied, or
      otherwise dirty in ways that break this single colour scheme prevent this
      ability from functioning, as does weaing anything of a different colour),
      multiple pieces of jewelry made of a specific material and containing
      specific designs (total value worth at least 1000 gold and must be custom
      made), or being skyclad.</p><p>When wearing this specific attire, ritually
      casting a spell only increases the cast time by 1 minute, and you may
      ritually cast two spells you have access to at once, provided they have
      the same casting time. This benefit only applies to spells that you
      ritually cast on your own.</p>
