      <p>Also at level 3, you are blessed by the volcano to endure its scourges.
      You are resistant to fire damage, and you treat areas heavily obscured by
      smoke as lightly obscured and lightly obscured by smoke as clearly
      visible. Finally, you can walk across the surface of lava as if it were
      solid ground, not sinking or treating it as difficult terrain, though you
      still take fire damage as normal (albeit reduced by your resistance).</p>
