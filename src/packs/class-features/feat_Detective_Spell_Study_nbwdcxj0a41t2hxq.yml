      <p>You are adept at sensing magic and its effects. If there are active
      magical effects near you, such as a spell effect on an object or a spell
      effect in an area, you automatically sense its presence. You don&rsquo;t
      know what spell effects there are or where they are, but you can
      automatically sense the effect of magic in a 20-foot radius around
      you.</p><p>In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect
      Magic}<strong>
      </strong>and&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.4rgo85d49qwancup]{Detect
      Thoughts} to your spellbook if they weren&rsquo;t already there. Whenever
      you cast detect magic, the range that you can sense magic is increased to
      60 feet. Whenever you cast detect thoughts, the range of creatures that
      you can read thoughts from is increased to 60 feet.</p>
