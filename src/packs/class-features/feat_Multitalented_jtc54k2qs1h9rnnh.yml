      <p>At 14th level, you have an incredible breadth of magical understanding.
      When you see a creature cast a spell of a level equal to or lower than
      your Intelligence modifier, you automatically know what spell it is.
      </p><p>In addition, choose one Flux effect. The chosen effect doesnâ€™t
      interfere with your normal use of Flux and can be used an unlimited number
      of times. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace it with a
      different Flux effect.</p>
