      <p>Hostile creatures within 120 feet gain vulnerability to necrotic
      damage. A creature with resistance to necrotic damage instead loses its
      resistance, and a creature immune to necrotic damage instead replaces that
      immunity with resistance.</p><p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can
      choose a different damage type for your aura.</p>
