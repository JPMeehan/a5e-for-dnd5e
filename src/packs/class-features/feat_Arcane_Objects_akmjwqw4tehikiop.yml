    value: >-
      <p>When you touch a magic item, either willingly or when hit by it, you
      are immediately aware that it&rsquo;s magical. If you hold such an item in
      your hand, you can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.dgms08g84zdlbr81]{Identify} on
      it as an action without spending a spell slot, even if you don&rsquo;t
      have the spell prepared.</p><p>In addition, when you cast <em>identify
      </em>using a spell slot or as a ritual, you also learn if the item is
      cursed, and the Narrator will give you a hint as to the curse&rsquo;s
      effects (which may be cryptic and vague, but must not be a lie).</p>
