      <p>Your body becomes laced with poison that drips from thorns at your
      wrists which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal poison damage
      equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier. In addition, your spell save DC is
      increased by 2 when casting a spell of the <em>poison </em>school, and
      whenever a spell you cast or a creature you&rsquo;ve summoned deals poison
      damage it deals an extra 1d6 damage.</p>
