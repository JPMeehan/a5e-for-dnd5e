      <p>At 13th level you’ve managed to truly improve on something or create
      something new altogether, taking a solid step forward in the technological
      development of the world. When you first gain this feature, choose a type
      of artisan’s tools you are proficient with and a newly invented foodstuff,
      object, or trade good that could conceivably be crafted using those tools.
      For example, using brewer’s supplies you could invent carbonated sodas,
      using glassblower’s tools you could invent glowing iridium glassware, or
      using jeweler’s tools you could invent a fine mechanism for better
      performing pocket watches.</p><p>Whenever you use your chosen tools to
      create trade goods, you can instead create your new invention as a trade
      good. Your new invention has a value equal to 5 times the value of normal
      trade goods created using those tools as shown on the Artisan’s Tools and
      Profession Checks table on page 338 of the Adventurer’s Guide. </p><p>Any
      other uses your invention may have are at the Narrator’s discretion, but
      its utility shouldn’t exceed that of other mundane adventuring gear.
      </p><p>In addition, your notoriety as a great inventor spreads along with
      your invention. While you are in a region you’ve sold your invention in,
      you have advantage on prestige checks.</p>
