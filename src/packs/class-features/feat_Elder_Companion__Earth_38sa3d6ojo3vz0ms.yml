      dir="ltr">As you grow in power, so does your elemental companion.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 11th level, your elemental companion grows to large size,
      though you can reduce it to medium or small or back again to large as an
      action. It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to
      d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are
      able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its
      Elder ability, shown below.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Earth, Earth&rsquo;s Embrace:</strong> Your elemental
      companion makes a melee attack against one creature Large or smaller
      creature within 5 ft. of it. It uses your spell attack bonus and deals
      damage equal to your earth blast. If the attack hits, the target is
      grappled (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple
      ends, the elemental can&rsquo;t burrow, but its slam attacks are made with
      advantage against the grappled target. The elemental can move at full
      speed while carrying grappled creatures. It can grapple one Large creature
      or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>
