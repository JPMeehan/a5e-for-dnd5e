      against them. You treat any weapon with the Finesse property as if it also
      had the Parrying property. In addition, whenever you use your reaction to
      add an expertise die to your AC using a Parrying weapon and the triggering
      attack misses you, you may immediately spend an exertion point to make a
      melee weapon attack against the creature that attacked you.</p>
