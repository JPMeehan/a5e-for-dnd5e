    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level you exude an aura of luck in a 10-foot radius around your
      person. Attacks within your aura that land critical hits deal an
      additional 1d6 damage (which is not doubled). This aura increases to 20
      feet at 5th level. The damage from this aura increases by 1d6 at levels 5,
      10, and 15.</p><p>In addition, you may use your Charisma modifier to
      determine your bonus to attack and damage rolls with weapons that
      don&rsquo;t have the finesse quality.</p>
