      <p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>7th level, Eldritch Chant
      feature</em></p><p dir="ltr">You can use an action to unleash your
      Eldritch Chant against all creatures within a sphere with a radius of
      fifteen feet, the origin of which must be within eighty feet of you. Each
      creature in the area makes an Intelligence saving throw. Creatures that
      fail take 6d4 Force damage and are Confused for 1 minute.</p><p
      dir="ltr">At the beginning of each round, roll 1d8 once and have each
      creature act in the same manner according to the roll. Instead of
      following the normal chart for Confused creatures, use the following
      chart:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">1&ndash;2: The Confused creatures do
      nothing.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">3&ndash;6: The Confused creatures take no action or
      bonus action and use all of their movement to move toward the nearest
      group of other Confused creatures, bunching together tightly. A creature
      adjacent to at least 3 other Violently Confused creatures stops moving and
      does not move if this option is rolled again.</p></li><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">7&ndash;8: The Confused
      creatures make a melee weapon or spell attack against another randomly
      determined creature within range. A Confused creature that is adjacent to
      at least 3 other Confused creatures activates this option on a roll of
      5&ndash;8.</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Creatures Confused by this invocation
      are able to take reactions, but only to make attacks of opportunity.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Creatures Confused by this invocation may make an Intelligence
      saving throw to free themselves from this feature when they take damage,
      but the save is at disadvantage if they are damaged by another Confused
      creature. They make this save against your spell save DC.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest. You also regain the use of this feature after
      you&rsquo;ve spent 5 spell points to cast a spell or use other features
      (or spent spell slots worth 5 spell points).</p>
