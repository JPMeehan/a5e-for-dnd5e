      <p>Whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack you may choose
      to do a Glorious Flourish.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Glorious
      Flourish</em></strong>.&nbsp;You and your weapons dance and shine with the
      glory of combat. Make a Performance check. Each hostile creature within 20
      feet of you makes a Charisma saving throw against a DC equal to the result
      of your Performance check. On a failure, a creature becomes charmed by you
      until the end of your next turn.</p>
