      <p>At 6th level, you&rsquo;ve developed an impressive expertise in spells
      of your chosen school. Choose one of the following benefits:</p>

      <h2>Arcane Armor</h2>

      <p>When you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you store some of
      its magic to protect yourself, gaining temporary hit points equal to twice
      the level of the spell, or three times the spell&rsquo;s level if the
      spell is from your chosen school. Instead of gaining these temporary hit
      points yourself, you can use your reaction to grant them to a creature
      within 30 feet.</p>

      <h2>Energy Retention</h2>

      <p>When you expend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to cast a wizard
      spell from your chosen school, you regain one expended spell slot. The
      regained spell slot must be of a level no more than half the level of the
      expended spell slot.</p>

      <h2>War Magic</h2>

      <p>When you deal damage with a wizard spell from your chosen school, you
      deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier on the first
      damage roll for that spell.</p>
