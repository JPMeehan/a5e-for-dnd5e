      <p>At 6th level your power grows as your altered physiology adapts to the
      life you&rsquo;ve led up to this point. You may choose one of the
      following abilities and are not bound by your flesh and bone
      selection.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Stone Eye</strong>: You may attempt to petrify a creature of
      your choosing within 60ft simply by meeting their gaze. As a bonus action
      on your turn you force the target to make a Constitution save against your
      spell save DC. On a failed save the target is Restrained or Petrified
      instead if they rolled a natural 1. At the end of their next turn
      restrained targets must make a second Constitution save, becoming
      Petrified on a failure. This petrification lasts for 1 minute and you may
      use it once per short rest, or expend two sorcery points as a bonus action
      to recover it.<br>In addition, if you possess the baleful gaze bonded
      power the effect does not end at the start of the creature&rsquo;s next
      turn. Instead they must make Constitution saves at the beginning of their
      turn to end the effect, and it lasts a maximum of 3 turns.</li>

      <li><strong>Wings of the Beast</strong>: You grow a pair of broad,
      leathery, wings not unlike those of a bat or a dragon. You gain a fly
      speed of 40ft. In addition, if you possess the beastmantle bonded power
      you may now make your tail attack as a ranged weapon attack. It has a
      range of 20/60 and flings poisoned spines. Your tail&rsquo;s damage
      increases to 1d10 piercing damage plus Constitution modifier poison damage
      and any creature damaged becomes poisoned for 1 minute.</li>

      <li><strong>Transmogrifier</strong>: Once per short rest you may use your
      action to transform yourself into a tiny or smaller creature, or an
      animated object up to medium size as per the spell&rsquo;s functions
      though you retain your mental attributes and can still perform S
      components for spellcasting purposes you cannot vocalize. You gain a
      number of temporary HP equal to the animated object&rsquo;s HP. Once your
      temporary HP run out you revert to your normal form, though you can choose
      to end this effect at any time, otherwise it has no duration. Any objects
      you carry become a part of your new form and do not function.<br>In
      addition, if you possess the shapeshifter bonded power you may use it a
      number of times per short rest equal to your proficiency bonus, but may
      still recover a use by expending a sorcery point as a bonus action.</li>
