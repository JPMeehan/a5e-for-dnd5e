      <p>Apotropaics&nbsp;are specific items that can repel or harm certain
      creatures, like bells driving away fiends. You can spend an action to
      reinforce an apotropaic you are touching for one day.</p><p>If you
      brandish a reinforced apotropaic to repel a creature, add an expertise die
      to your opposed Charisma check. If a creature tries to bypass the
      repellent effect of a reinforced apotropaic barrier (like an undead
      crossing a line of salt), add an expertise die to the flat DC the creature
      must overcome. If a reinforced item is used to harm a creature (like jade
      dust against an aberration), you can also make an opposed Charisma check
      to repel that creature without needing to spend a separate action (and you
      add an expertise die to your check).</p>
