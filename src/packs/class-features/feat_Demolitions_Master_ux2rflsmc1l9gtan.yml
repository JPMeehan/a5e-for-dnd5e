      force damage, and immunity to the deafened condition.</p><p>You may
      simultaneously set up to a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus
      when using Precision Explosives. Items set in this way always explode
      simultaneously.</p><p>Your alchemical grenades and items made using
      Tactical Chemistry deal twice as much damage to objects and vehicles.</p>
