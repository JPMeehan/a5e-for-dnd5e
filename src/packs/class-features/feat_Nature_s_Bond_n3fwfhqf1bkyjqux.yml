      <p>Also at 2nd level, nature provides you with the ability to summon its
      minor spirits. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape
      feature to cast the find familiar spell, without material
      components.</p><p>The familiar you summon is a fey instead of a beast, and
      it disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.</p>
