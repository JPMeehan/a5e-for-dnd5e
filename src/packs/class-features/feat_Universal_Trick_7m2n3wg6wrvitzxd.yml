      <p>Whether from watching your fellow adventurers work, from tales of your
      predecessors, or simply because you are just that talented, you have taken
      to adopting the techniques of your peers. </p><p>At 13th level, and again
      at 16th and 19th level, you learn a developed talent from the berserker
      class, a sign of faith from the cleric class, a soldiering knack from the
      fighter class, or an elective study from the wizard class. You may only
      learn one Universal Trick from any individual class.</p>
