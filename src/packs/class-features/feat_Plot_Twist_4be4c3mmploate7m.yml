      <p>Starting at 6th level, when a creature you have granted Bardic
      Inspiration to fails an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you
      can spend your reaction to declare that isn&rsquo;t how the story goes and
      allow it to roll again, including your Bardic Inspiration die, taking the
      higher result. This reroll spends the Bardic Inspiration die, even if the
      creature did not spend it on the first roll.</p>

      <p>Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
