    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, your time in the thick of combat has hardened your
      psyche. You gain immunity to the frightened condition, and you have
      advantage on saving throws to avoid being charmed or compelled. In
      addition, during a short rest or upon the completion of a long rest you
      may spend a hit die to remove one level of fatigue or strife. You may only
      spend one die this way per rest.</p>
