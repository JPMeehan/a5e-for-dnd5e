      <p dir="ltr">At 17th level, you can perform a special ritual to give a
      community a head-start on recovering from a natural disaster, war, monster
      attack, or other large-scale event. To perform the ritual, you must spend
      8 hours in uninterrupted work in a single location and it costs 1000 gp in
      material components. When the ritual completes, you may specify up to
      1,000 targets of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.pblaa5w3f6tuqxuj]{Mending}
      effects, up to 50 targets of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.fe2d3gkhdwtibizq]{Purify Food
      and Drink} effects, and up to 5
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.tk8q47k7yjntw4c2]{Fabricate}
      effects.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, you may choose one structure that
      has suffered damage, such as an Inn, Tower, or Main Gate and fully repair
      it using rubble or nearby raw materials. A massive castle, long road, or
      city walls may only be partially repaired by this ability, subject to
      Narrator discretion. All of the effects must take place within 1 mile of
      your position. Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so
      again for 7 days.</p>
