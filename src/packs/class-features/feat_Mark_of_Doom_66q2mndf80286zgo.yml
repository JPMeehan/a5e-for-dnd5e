      <p>At 17th level, your Mark of the Pariah ability improves dramatically. A
      marked creature cannot recover hit points while the mark persists and the
      additional psychic damage to attacks increases to 2d4. A creature that
      saves still suffers the additional psychic damage on attacks, but avoids
      all other effects.</p>
