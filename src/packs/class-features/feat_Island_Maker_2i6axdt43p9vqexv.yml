      <p>At 20th level, you can create a new island where one did not previously
      exist. To do so, you must select an area of open sea at least 2 miles from
      any existing landmass. You must then spend a week&rsquo;s worth of 8-hour
      days performing a magical ritual over the area, during which time a new
      volcanic vent opens and creates a new island with an area of [[1d4+1]]
      square miles. The surface is covered in rich volcanic soil that any plants
      native to the surrounding area will thrive in, and the process also
      magically stocks the surrounding waters with schools of fish suitable for
      fishing. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for a
      year. Additionally, once you have used this ability [[/r 1d6]] times, you
      must undertake some great task (Narrator&rsquo;s discretion) to regain the
      ability to do so another [[/r 1d6]] times.</p>
