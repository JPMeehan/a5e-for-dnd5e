      <p dir="ltr">Beginning at 2nd level, you can clutch your holy symbol and
      emit a blast of elemental energy. Enemy creatures within 30 feet make a
      Constitution saving throw or take damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric
      level, or half damage on a success. The damage type varies based on your
      archetype spell list. This power also has an extra effect, likewise
      determined by your archetype spell list.</p>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Fire Priest.</strong> Fire
      damage. Unattended flammable objects within 30 feet of you catch fire.
      Traps in the area are subject to the fire damage (they automatically fail
      the save), and magical effects whose spell-level + 10 is less than your
      spell save DC are dispelled.&nbsp;</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Ice Priest.</strong> Cold damage.
      Ground within 30 feet of you is caked in frost, becoming difficult terrain
      for 1 minute. Nonmagical fires in the area are snuffed out.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Plant Priest.</strong> Poison
      damage. Gnarled brambles burst through the ground within 30 feet of you
      (unless it is metal thicker than 3 inches or stone thicker than 1 foot),
      which becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Stone Priest.</strong> Force
      damage. Creatures who failed their saving throw are knocked prone. The
      ground becomes cracked and broken within 30 feet of you (unless it is
      metal thicker than 3 inches or stone thicker than 1 foot), becoming
      difficult terrain.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Storm Priest.</strong> Lightning
      damage. Creatures wearing metal armor and creatures in trees or in the
      water have disadvantage on their save. Creatures who fail their save
      can&rsquo;t take reactions for 1 minute.</p>

      Priest</strong><strong>.</strong> Acid damage. Nonmagical fires within 30
      feet of you are snuffed out. Traps in the area are subject to the acid
      damage (they automatically fail the save), and magical effects whose
      spell-level + 10 is less than your spell save DC are dispelled</p>
