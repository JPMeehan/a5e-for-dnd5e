      <p>At 9th level, you have created a flair that you use when casting
      spells. Choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a long
      rest, you may replace your flair with another.</p><p>Whenever you cast a
      spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose to cast it with your flair.
      You can do so again when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><h3><strong>Warding</strong></h3><p>After casting the spell,
      until the start of your next turn, a creature who attempts to attack you
      must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must choose a new target
      or waste its attack.</p>
