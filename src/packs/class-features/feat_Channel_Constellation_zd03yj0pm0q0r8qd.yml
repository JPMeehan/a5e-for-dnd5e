      <p>At 10th level, when you cast a spell that summons beasts or fey, you
      may instead summon a manifestation of a constellation instead. The
      creatures summoned have resistance to radiant damage and damage from
      non-magical weapons, Truesight, and their attacks all deal an additional
      1d6 radiant damage. You may also gain the same benefits when you use a
      Wildshape. You may only apply these benefits once per short or long
      rest.</p>
