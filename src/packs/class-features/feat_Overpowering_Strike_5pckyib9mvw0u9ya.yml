      <p>At 10th level, your attacks literally blow your opponents away. Once
      per turn when you make a melee weapon attack, you may choose to have the
      target make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Strength modifier). On a failure, you choose whether it falls prone or is
      moved 5 feet away from you.</p>
