      <p>At 14th level, youâ€™ve reached the pinnacle of your chosen magics.
      Choose one of the following benefits:</p><h3><strong>Heightened
      Potency</strong></h3><p>When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen
      school, it is always treated as though it were cast with a spell slot one
      level higher (maximum 9th-level) than the one you used, so long as you
      expended a spell slot to cast it. The slot you use to cast the spell must
      still be at least equal to the level of the spell.</p>
