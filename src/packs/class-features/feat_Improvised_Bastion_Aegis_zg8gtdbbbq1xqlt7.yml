      <p>When a creature’s attack, spell, or ability would damage you, you can
      use your reaction to devise a momentary defense (using a chair as a
      shield, predicting a safe spot in an explosion, diluting a spray of acid
      with a solvent, etc). You gain resistance to one type of damage you would
      take, which protects you only against the triggering hostile act.</p>
