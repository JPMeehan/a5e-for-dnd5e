      <p>You gain an expertise die on Acrobatics and Athletics checks made to
      climb, jump, run, and swim. When your party makes a group Acrobatics or
      Athletics check, you may apply the results of your roll to yourself and
      one ally. You can choose which ally to apply your result to after everyone
      has rolled, but must do so before the Narrator says whether you succeed or
      fail.</p>
