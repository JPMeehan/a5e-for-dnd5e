      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
      Channel Divinity options.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Accursed Wound.</em></strong> When you hit with a melee
      weapon attack, you can use your channel divinity to curse the wound (no
      action required). The target of the attack takes an additional 1d8
      necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your
      spell save DC. If the target fails, it cannot regain hit points until it
      finishes a long rest. If it succeeds, its maximum hit points are reduced
      by an amount equal to the damage done by your attack until it finishes a
      long rest.</p>

      <p><strong><em>At a Moment&rsquo;s Notice.</em></strong> You may perform
      an hour-long ritual to mark a suit of armor, and either a pair of weapons
      or a weapon and a shield. Thereafter, you may use your channel divinity as
      a bonus action to summon the marked items onto your body. The armor
      appears on your body and any weapon or shield appears in your hands. If
      you are wearing different armor or are carrying other items, they appear
      in a neat pile at your feet. This effect works at any distance, provided
      your marked items are on the same plane as you.</p>
