    value: >-
      <p>You share a kinship with the wolves, and find it hard to resist howling
      at the moon. You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks regarding
      wolves and other canine creatures.</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain the ability to howl like a wolf as an action.
      This wolf howl is magically amplified, and is audible up to a range of 5
      miles. This howl can carry information in Druidic, and can be understood
      by wolves, canines, and other creatures that can understand Druidic.</p>
