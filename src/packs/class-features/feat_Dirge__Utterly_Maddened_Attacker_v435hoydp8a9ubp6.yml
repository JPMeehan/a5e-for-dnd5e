      <p dir="ltr">You cause a creature to gain advantage on all its attacks and
      have its critical hit range with all attacks increase by 1 for the next
      minute. However, the creature must use every type of action available to
      it to attack creatures within its reach or range; if there are no
      creatures within its reach or range to attack, it must move toward the
      nearest creature to it and begin attacking.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Whenever the target creature misses with an attack, it takes
      damage equal to its proficiency bonus.</p>
