      <p dir="ltr">Using the air currents and rushing wind, you gain a Fly speed
      equal to your speed, and can hover while you remain conscious. When
      traveling overland in a smooth, direct path, you can increase your Fly at
      a speed equal to double your speed in miles per hour, or half if you take
      other actions while flying (such as actively searching). You can use
      overland flight for a number of hours per day equal to your spellcasting
      ability modifier, or twice as long if you move half speed. If you continue
      to Fly after that, you must make a DC 15 Constitution save or suffer a
      level of fatigue. You repeat this save once each additional hour of
      flight.</p>
