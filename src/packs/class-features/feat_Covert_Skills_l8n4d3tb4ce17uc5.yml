      <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to blend in wherever you need to, fight
      with what you have, observe without being observed, and get away cleanly.
      You gain proficiency with the Stealth, Deception, and Culture skills,
      Thieves&rsquo; Tools, the Disguise Kit, the garrote, and improvised
      weapons. Improvised weapons are considered adept weapons for you.</p>
