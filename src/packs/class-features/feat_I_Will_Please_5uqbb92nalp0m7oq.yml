      <p>At 14th level, you can spend an action and use a mix of soothing
      remedies and confident bedside manner to help an ally overcome some
      ailment. This can make the creature suffer no effects from one disease for
      a day, or can let it ignore one of the following conditions: blinded ,
      deafened , paralyzed , or poisoned .</p><p>If you use this technique too
      often, you lose the necessary confidence for the placebo to work. Once you
      use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can
      use it again.</p>
