      <p>You have come to understand your literal travels as a reflection of a
      deeper, spiritual journey that all travel together. Whenever a creature
      within 30 feet of you gains inspiration from their destiny&rsquo;s source
      of inspiration, you gain inspiration as well if you do not already have
      it. Once you have gained inspiration in this way, you cannot gain it again
      from the same creature until you have completed a long rest.</p>
