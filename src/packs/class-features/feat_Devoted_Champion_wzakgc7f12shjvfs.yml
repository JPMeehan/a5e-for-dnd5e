      <p>At 20th level you gain the Lawful alignment. As a bonus action you may
      grant yourself the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You gain an additional reaction usable each turn in addition to your
      normal reaction. This may only be used on your bodyguard ability.</li>

      <li>At any point while this ability is active, you may issue a challenge
      to another creature. They must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure
      they cannot willingly move more then 30 feet away from you. You have
      advantage on weapon attack rolls agaisnt them, deal an additional 1d8
      damage against them with your divine smite, and they have disadvantage on
      attack rolls against anyone except you. This effect ends early if either
      of you start your turn more than 30 feet from each other.</li>

      </ul>
