      <p>At 6th level your reputation has begun to flourish for its own sake,
      and you may choose one of the following options to represent how it has
      grown. In addition, your maneuver DC increases by
      1.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Heroic Flair: </strong>Tales of your heroism
      spread before you. When you enter into a settlement you are treated by the
      populace as a wandering hero. People of modest means are eager to see you
      accommodated. You and your party no longer need to pay for Lifestyle
      Expenses and benefit from a moderate lifestyle. Additionally, you are
      likely to be approached by townsfolk with information relevant to your
      current goals, so long as you are open about your presence in the
      settlement. Sneaking or going Incognito negates these
      benefits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Military Garb: </strong>Your history of
      working with caravaneers, guards, sailors, and soldiers sees you welcomed
      in such social circles and circumstances. You gain a warm welcome from
      such characters in any situation except for antagonistic, and gain
      advantage on Deception and Persuasion checks against any caravaneer,
      guard, sailor, or soldier you meet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Villainâ€™s
      Affront: </strong>Rumors of your villainy and violence abound, and people
      are justly terrified of it. When you enter a settlement, guards and
      soldiers go on alert as word of your presence spreads, people clear
      streets rather than risk offending you, and the underworld ripples in your
      wake. You gain advantage on Intimidation checks against any person in town
      with a CR lower than your level, and are likely to be approached by
      cultists and members of thieves guilds who may be willing to pay for your
      assistance.</p></li></ul>
