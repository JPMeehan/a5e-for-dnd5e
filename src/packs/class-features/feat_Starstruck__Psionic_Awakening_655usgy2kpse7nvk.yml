      <p>You gain telepathy out to a range of 30 feet. You can telepathically
      communicate with one creature you can see so long as that creature knows
      at least one language. If you already have telepathy, its range increases
      by 30 feet.</p><p>Additionally, when you cast a warlock spell you can
      choose to do so psionically, without the need for vocalized or seen
      components. Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until
      you finish a short or long rest.</p>
