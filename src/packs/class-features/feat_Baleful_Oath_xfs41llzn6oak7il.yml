      <p>You have studied the history of ancient curses and oaths, and in doing
      so learned to turn this knowledge on others. You may spend a hit die to
      replicate the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.339zx6f5jk81fobw]{Bestow Curse}
      spell. Starting at level 9 you may plumb even darker depth of knowledge to
      instead replicate it as if it were cast at 5th level, 7th level at level
      13, and lasting indefinitely without concentration until removed at level
      17, though such knowledge takes a toll on those who study it, and using
      the improved version of this curse grants you a level of strife. Only one
      creature may be cursed by you at a time, and if you curse another the
      curse on the previous creature immediately ends.</p>
