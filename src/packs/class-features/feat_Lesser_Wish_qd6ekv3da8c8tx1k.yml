    value: >-
      <p>You have gained the ability to conjure a lesser wish or be granted one
      by your patron. As an action you can speak your desire and cast any spell
      of 6th level or lower with no components required, and it takes effect
      immediately regardless of its normal casting time. The selected spell is
      cast as if it were using a 6th level slot. Once you have done so you
      cannot do so again until you have finished 1d4+1 long rests.</p><p>You
      also add @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.pe52jryde7ljobzq]{Wish} to
      the list of warlock spells available for the <em>Penultimate Arcanum</em>
      invocation.</p>
