      <p>At 20th level, nature sustains you and mends your wounds. At the start
      of each of your turns while you are bloodied, you regain hit points equal
      to 5 + your Constitution modifier. You donâ€™t gain this benefit if you have
      0 hit points. </p><p>In addition, while you are using Armaments of Nature
      the amount of hit points you regain doubles, you regain hit points even
      when you are not bloodied, and weapons formed using Armaments of Nature
      gain a +3 magical bonus to attack and damage.</p>
