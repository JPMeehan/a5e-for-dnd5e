      <p dir="ltr">By sensing the currents and vibrations in the water, you gain
      blindsight with a 60 ft radius to detect anything that is in contact with
      the same body of water as you. With blindsight, you are not affected by
      darkness or other obscured areas. Your blindsight is hearing based and
      does not operate if you are deafened. You can also see through fog, mist,
      or rain and snow as if they were transparent, though you know they are
      there.</p>
