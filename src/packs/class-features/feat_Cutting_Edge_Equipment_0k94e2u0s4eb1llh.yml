      <p>At 15th level, you apply your final upgrades to your equipment. Choose
      one of the following options or one of the options from levels 5 or
      9&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Cutting-Edge Armor</h2>

      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Advanced Armor</em></p>

      <p>Your armor&rsquo;s AC increases by 1, and you gain an additional
      feature based on its type:</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting-Edge Light Armor: </strong>You gain a Climb speed equal
      to your walking speed and you are permanently under a spider climb effect
      while you are wearing it.</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting-Edge Medium Armor: </strong>Your armor now includes
      various measures to prevent you from succumbing to the worst that
      supernatural foes can dish out. You gain immunity to the petrified
      condition and make saving throws to avoid the confused, frightened,
      incapacitated, paralyzed, and slowed conditions with advantage.</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting-Edge Heavy Armor: </strong>Your armor now protects your
      allies as well as you and has anti- magic countermeasures incorporated.
      Friendly creatures your size or smaller can use you to provide 3/4th
      cover. Your armor is also immune to magical spells and effects that target
      it specifically such as the heat metal spell or a rust monster&rsquo;s
      antennae.</p>

      <h2>Cutting-Edge Weapon</h2>

      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Advanced Weapon</em></p>

      <p>Choose two first-level combat maneuvers that cost no more than 1
      exertion. While wielding your weapon, you can use these maneuvers at will
      without spending exertion.</p>

      <h2>Cutting-Edge Automaton</h2>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong><em>Advanced Automaton</em></p>

      <p>Your automaton&rsquo;s speed increases by 20 feet, its AC increases to
      17, its hit points increase to 70, and you add one of the following
      options:</p>

      <p><strong>Stabilizer Ray:</strong> The automaton gains 3 charges which
      stack with the ones from Autonomous Medic and Antitoxin Module (if
      applicable). As an action on its turn, the automaton can spend a charge to
      automatically stabilize a creature making death saves within 30 feet of
      it. It regains all spent charges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Tinkerer&rsquo;s Arms:</strong> The automaton gains a set of
      built-in thieves&rsquo; tools and can use them with a bonus equal to your
      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier at your direction.</p>

      <p><strong>Teleportation Module:</strong> As a bonus action on your turn,
      you can teleport to an empty space adjacent to your automaton. Once you
      have used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence
      modifier (minimum once) you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
