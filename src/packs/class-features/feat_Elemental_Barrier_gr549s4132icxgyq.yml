    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">As an action, you manifest a rough barrier of elemental
      material that you can control (earth and stone for earth, or water or ice
      for water). The barrier is a wall (3 ft wide, 5 ft tall, AC 10, 5 hit
      points per level) that is unable to support more than 5 lbs of weight.
      Water or ice is translucent, but earthen material is opaque. You can have
      a number of elemental barriers in existence equal to your spellcasting
      ability modifier; if you create more than your limit, you choose one of
      your existing barriers to crumble. Water and ice barriers last only 1
      minute, unless the ambient temperature is below freezing.</p>
