      <p>Once per turn when you would make a melee weapon attack as part of the
      Attack action or an opportunity attack, you can instead make a melee spell
      attack, lashing out with an ephemeral and unearthly blade. On hit, the
      target takes 1d8 force damage. In addition, you can choose a creature that
      you can see and that is within your reach. It takes half as much
      damage.</p>
