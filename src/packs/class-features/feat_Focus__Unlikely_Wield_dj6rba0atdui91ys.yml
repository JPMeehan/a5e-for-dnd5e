      <p><em>Requirement: 11th level</em></p><p>You can wield three weapons with
      the light property at once. Typically this is done with a dagger wielded
      between toes, but it has been known to be done with the mouth (or even a
      tail for combatants that have one). When you engage in two weapon
      fighting, you can use the third weapon to make an additional weapon
      attack.</p>
