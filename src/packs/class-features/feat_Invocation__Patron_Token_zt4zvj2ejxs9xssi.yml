      <p>Your patron gifts you with a patron token.&nbsp;You are unable to sell
      your patron token, and if you somehow lose it the next time you finish a
      long rest you discover it on your person. Once your token is consumed,
      your patron replaces it and you find it on your person the next time you
      finish a long rest.</p>
