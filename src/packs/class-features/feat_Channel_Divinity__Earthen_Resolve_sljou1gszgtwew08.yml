      <p>When you are subjected to an effect that would alter your behavior
      (such as becoming&nbsp;<span

      class="freelinking-link">confused</span>, or&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">frightened</span>) or that would allow another
      creature to dictate your actions (such as the<em>&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">command</span>&nbsp;</em>spell), you can use your
