      <p>The draconic magic that nestles within you has adapted your body to the
      harsh trials that lie&nbsp;between you and your destiny. Beginning at 1st
      level when you choose this archetype, your hit point maximum increases by
      1, and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
      </p><p>In addition, when you arenâ€™t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 +
      your Dexterity modifier. How exactly this fortitude manifests on your body
      can vary widely, but unless actively concealed it marks your connection to
      dragonkind.</p>
