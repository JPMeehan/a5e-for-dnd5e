      <p>At 9th level you choose to embrace either the wild savagery of nature
      or the control you need to protect it. Choose one of the
      following:</p><h3><strong>EMBRACED FEROCITY</strong></h3><p>You gain a +2
      bonus on attack rolls you make while in a Wild Shape. In addition,
      whenever you use Wild Shape to transform into a creature, you gain a
      number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 × the creature’s CR (minimum
      1d8) instead of 1d4 × CR.</p>
