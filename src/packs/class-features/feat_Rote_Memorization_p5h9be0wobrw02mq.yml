      <p>Choose one cantrip which has a casting time of 1 action and
      doesn&rsquo;t deal damage. You can cast that cantrip as a bonus action
      without any seen or material components a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you
      finish a long rest, and can switch the cantrip associated with this
      feature each time you gain a wizard level.</p>
