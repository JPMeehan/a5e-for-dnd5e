      <p>At 10th level, you can repurpose disease as a tool of decomposition.
      When you would contract a nonmagical disease, you can choose to become a
      carrier of the disease instead. You can be a carrier of only one disease
      at a time. While you are a carrier of a disease, the disease does not
      affect you, but it remains dormant in your system. When you touch
      a&nbsp;bloodied</span>&nbsp;creature or hit it with a melee weapon attack,
      you can force the creature to make a Constitution&nbsp;saving
      throw</span>&nbsp;against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature
      contracts the disease you carry.</p><p>Additionally, you always have
      the<em>&nbsp;contagion&nbsp;</em>spell prepared, and you can cast it
      without expending a spell slot. Once you&rsquo;ve
      cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>&nbsp;in this way, you must finish
      a&nbsp;<span>long rest&nbsp;before you can do so again. When you
      cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>, you can choose to spread
      the&nbsp;<span>disease you&rsquo;re carrying, instead of one of the
      diseases presented in the spell&rsquo;s description.</p>
