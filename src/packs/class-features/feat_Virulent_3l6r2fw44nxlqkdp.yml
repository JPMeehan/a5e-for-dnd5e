      <p>At 10th level, you can repurpose disease as a tool of decomposition.
      When you would contract a nonmagical disease, you can choose to become a
      carrier of the disease instead. You can be a carrier of only one disease
      at a time. While you are a carrier of a disease, the disease does not
      affect you, but it remains dormant in your system. When you touch
      a&nbsp;bloodied&nbsp;creature or hit it with a melee weapon attack, you
      can force the creature to make a Constitution&nbsp;saving
      throw&nbsp;against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature
      contracts the disease you carry.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you always have the<em>
      </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.vms65nmhqqgu9b2w]{Contagion}
      spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once
      you&rsquo;ve cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>&nbsp;in this way, you must
      finish a&nbsp;long rest&nbsp;before you can do so again. When you
      cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>, you can choose to spread the&nbsp;disease
      you&rsquo;re carrying, instead of one of the diseases presented in the
      spell&rsquo;s description.</p>
