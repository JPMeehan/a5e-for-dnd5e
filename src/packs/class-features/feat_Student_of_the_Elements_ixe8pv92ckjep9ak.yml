      3rd level, you gain proficiency in a skill associated with your elemental
      affinity, or an expertise die in that skill if you are already proficient.
      When you gain the Expand Element, Improved Expand Element, and Greater
      Expand Element features at 5th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you
      gain this feature again with reference to the elemental affinity you added
      or improved at that level.</span></p>
