      <p dir="ltr">At 2nd level, dead and undead humanoids and beasts understand
      anything you verbally communicate in Druidic, and you can comprehend them
      in return. The knowledge and understanding of such things are limited -
      such as a creature that has been dead for some time might be able to tell
      you about where it lived, or what killed it, but could not tell you
      anything about the nearby town that didn&rsquo;t exist at the time of its
      demise. The creatures are in no way obligated to respond to the
      druid.&nbsp;</p>
