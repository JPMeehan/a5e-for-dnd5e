      <p>At 1st level you gain one of the following features:</p>

      <h2>Light of Life</h2>

      <p>You can touch a creature to heal it for 2d8 + you proficiency bonus hit
      points.</p>

      <p>Alternatively you may end a disease or one of the following conditions:
      blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. You can do so once per long
      rest for every two warlock levels you possess.</p>

      <h2>Righteous Curse</h2>

      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>

      <p>The curse has the following effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an
      additional 1d4 radiant damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level,
      and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>

      <li>Whenever the cursed creature attacks you or targets only you with a
      spell, your suffering is rewarded and you regain 1d6 hit points.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
