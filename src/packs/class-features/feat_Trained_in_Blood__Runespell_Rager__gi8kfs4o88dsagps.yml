      dir="ltr"><strong>Invocation of the Courts:</strong>&nbsp;Your study into
      other realms has let you steal some of their secrets. You learn one
      invocation from the Invocation of the Courts warlock feature for which you
      meet the prerequisites. You may use runespell rager levels in place of
      warlock levels to meet these prerequisites.</p></li><li dir="ltr"

      impatience sometimes leads you to kill first and ask questions later, but
      through magic you figured out how to make such interrogations work anyway.
      You learn speak with dead and may cast the spell once per short rest
      without expending spell points. If you target the corpse of a creature
      that you or an ally killed within the past hour, the creature must succeed
      on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be so frightened of
      you, even in death, that it answers truthfully.</p></li><li dir="ltr"

      may choose one of the options granted by the Martial Presence berserker
      feature.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>
