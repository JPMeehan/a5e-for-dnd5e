      <p>At 9th level, you invent a new way to increase the danger posed by your
      traps. You learn one of the following trap capabilities. When using
      Trapmaking to create a trap, you can choose to augment it with the new
      capability, which is triggered when your trap damages a
      creature.</p><h3><strong>Vial Trap</strong></h3><p>Each creature within 5
      feet of the trap must make a Dexterity saving throw or be splashed with a
      liquid, such as acid or alchemistsâ€™ fire (see Chapter 4: Equipment). The
      liquid is consumed.</p>
