      <p><span style="color: #191813;">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense
      of when things nearby aren&rsquo;t as they should be, giving you an edge
      when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving
      throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain
      this benefit, you can&rsquo;t be blinded, deafened, or
      incapacitated.</span></p>
