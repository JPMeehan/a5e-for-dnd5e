      <p>Starting at 10th level, if a creature uses the Disengage action to
      leave your reach while you are raging, you can use your reaction to follow
      them a number of feet equal to double your Speed. You can use this feature
      a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended
      uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
