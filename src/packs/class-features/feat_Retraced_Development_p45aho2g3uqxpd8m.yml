      <p style="text-align: left;">Even if dumped into the wilderness with
      nothing you&rsquo;d get a laboratory back up and running in no time. With
      1 hour of work you can create ramshackle versions of any type of
      artisan&rsquo;s tools out of wood and stone. You take a &ndash;2 penalty
      on checks made with these ramshackle tools, only you can make use of them,
      and they have no sale value, but you can use them just like normal
      versions of those tools and they can also be used as tools of
      artifice.</p>
