      <p>When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you learn how to use flame
      to not just harm but heal. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell of
      1st-level or higher that deals fire damage, you can choose one creature
      that would take damage from the spell. Instead of taking damage from the
      spell, it is healed for a number of hit points equal to the spellâ€™s level
      plus your proficiency bonus.</p>
