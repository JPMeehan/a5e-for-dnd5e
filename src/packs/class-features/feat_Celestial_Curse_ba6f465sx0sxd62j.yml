      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>

      <p>The curse has the following effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an
      additional 1d4 radiant damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level,
      and again at 15th and 20th level.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Upon placing the curse, your patron fills you with a spirit of
      perseverance. You gain temporary hit points equal to spellcasting ability
      modifier + your warlock level (minimum 1). If you already have temporary
      hit points when you use this feature, you instead increase your temporary
      hit points by this amount.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
