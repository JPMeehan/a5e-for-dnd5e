      <p>Your oath allows you to channel the divine for more magical effects
      than just casting spells. Each Channel Divinity option granted by your
      oath explains how to use it. Whenever you use your Channel Divinity, you
      choose which option to use. Once you have used this feature you can't do
      so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Some Channel
      Divinity options require saving throws. When using such an effect, the DC
      for the saving throw equals your herald spell save DC.</p>
