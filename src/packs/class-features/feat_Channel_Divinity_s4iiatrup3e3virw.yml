      <p>At 2nd level, you are able to channel the energy of your greater entity
      directly, and use it for a variety of magical effects. You start with two
      of these effects:
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.zhuf06durl8bnmh3]{Turn
      Undead} and an additional effect dependent on your chosen Cleric
      Archetype. Some archetypes provide additional uses of Channel Divinity as
      your cleric level increases, detailed under the heading of your chosen
      archetypes.</p><p>You may choose which Channel Divinity effect to create
      each time you use this feature. You must then finish a short or long rest
      before you&rsquo;re able to Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel
      Divinity effects require saving throws. The DC for this is the same as
      your cleric spell save DC.</p><p>From 6th level you can use your Channel
      Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it
      three times between rests. Finishing a short or long rest regains your
      expended uses.</p>
