      <p>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to unleash a flood of
      negative energy on your foes. Hostile creatures within 30 feet of you make
      a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a hostile creature takes
      2d8 necrotic damage and is pushed back 5 feet, or on a success it takes
      half damage and is not pushed back.</p>
