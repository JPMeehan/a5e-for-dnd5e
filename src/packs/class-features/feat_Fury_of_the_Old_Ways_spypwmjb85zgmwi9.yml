      <p dir="ltr">At 8th level, choose one benefit from the following:</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Boon of Fury</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">Your weapon attacks deal extra damage equal to your Wisdom
      modifier. In addition, you can infuse divine power into a weapon attack to
      deal an extra 1d8 damage, the type of which is the same as you deal with
      Channel Divinity: Elemental Intervention. Once you have used this feature
      a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Furious Spellcraft</strong></h4>

      <p dir="ltr">Damage you deal with Cleric cantrips increases by your Wisdom
      modifier. You also learn a bonus cantrip chosen from your elemental school
      (from any class&rsquo;s spell list).</p>
