      <p><strong>Tenets of the Inquisitor</strong></p><p>All inquisitors hold
      similar tenets, regardless of the deity they serve.</p><p>• Have Faith.
      Have faith in yourself, your actions, and above all the order which you
      serve.</p><p>• Loyalty Above All. Your word is your bond, and loyalty is
      an integral part of who you are.</p><p>• Question Everyone. All outside of
      your order should be regarded as potential heretics, lest worldly
      connections prevent you from carrying out your duty.</p><p>• Without
      Mercy. You must pass judgment without mercy as you carry out divine
      retribution.</p><p></p><p>Archetype School</p><p>Add the communication
      school of magic to your list of herald spells.</p>
