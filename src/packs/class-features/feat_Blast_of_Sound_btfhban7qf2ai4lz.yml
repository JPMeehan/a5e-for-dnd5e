    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you learn to use sound not just as a tool, but as a
      weapon. As an action, you can emit a powerful blast of sound in a 15-foot
      cone. Creatures caught in the blast must make a Constitution&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">save</span>&nbsp;against your&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">spell save</span>&nbsp;DC. On a failed saving
      throw, the target takes 2d8 thunder damage and is&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">deafened</span> until the end of its next turn.
      On a success, the target takes half damage and isn&rsquo;t deafened. The
      damage increases to 3d8 at level 11. At 17th level, the damage increases
      to 4d8 and the blast becomes a 30-foot cone.</p>
