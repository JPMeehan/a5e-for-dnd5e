      <p dir="ltr">At 2nd level, you scar the palms of your hands with runes
      that can be activated to create a powerful weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">You can
      use your action to conjure in your empty hand an armament bestowed with
      power: a runescar weapon, which may have the appearance of any melee
      weapon of your choice. You are proficient with it while you wield your
      runescar weapon and you may always use your Constitution ability for
      attack and damage rolls with it. Your runescar weapon may be wielded in
      one or two hands and deals 1d10 force damage.</p><p dir="ltr">You may
      never benefit from the Duelist fighting style while wielding your runescar
      weapon. If you engage in two-weapon fighting while holding your runescar
      weapon in one hand, its damage decreases to 1d8.</p><p dir="ltr">Your
      runescar weapon has the Heavy property, but it does not impose
      disadvantage on attack rolls if your size is Small or smaller. In
      addition, your runescar weapon has the Thrown property (range 15/30) and
      reappears in your hand immediately after hitting or missing its intended
      target.</p><p dir="ltr">Your runescar weapon disappears if it is more than
      5 feet away from you and wasn&rsquo;t thrown. It also disappears if you
      use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or
      if you die.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Your runescar weapon counts as magical
      for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
      attacks and damage. It counts as a spellcasting focus and does not prevent
      you from performing the seen components of a spell or from providing
      material components.</p><p dir="ltr">By performing a 1-hour ritual while
      painting or carving magical runes onto a magic weapon, you can transfer
      its magic properties to your runescar weapon. This causes the weapon
      itself to disappear to an extradimensional space and causes your runescar
      weapon to gain any magical traits the weapon had if they are able to be
      applied to a melee weapon. You may only transfer the traits of one magical
      weapon at a time to your runescar weapon and can&rsquo;t transfer the
      magical traits of an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The magic
      weapon appears at your feet, bond severed, if you perform this ritual on a
      different weapon, if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it, or
      if you die.&nbsp;</p>
