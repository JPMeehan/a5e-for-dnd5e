      <p>At 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals fire damage and forces a
      saving throw, creatures that fail their first saving throw against it
      suffer ongoing fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. At the
      start of each of its turns a creature repeats the saving throw, ending the
      ongoing fire damage on a success.</p>
