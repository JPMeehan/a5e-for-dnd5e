      <p>Also at 3rd level, you’ve learned to use just the right words and
      mannerisms instead of exerting yourself to turn the tide of battle.
      Whenever you would spend exertion points on a duelist feature or a
      maneuver from the Mirror’s Glint, Mist and Shade, or Rapid Current combat
      traditions, you may reduce the exertion point cost of that maneuver or
      feature by 1 (minimum 0). Once you have used this feature a number of
      times equal to your Charisma modifier, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
