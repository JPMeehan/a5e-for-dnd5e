      <p>As an action, you focus your energy on creating an aura around you that
      turns ones deepest fears into a reality.</p><p>Each creature of your
      choice that can see you, and is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
      saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save, the target is frightened of you for
      1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than
      30 feet away from you, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end
      the effect on it.</p>
