    value: >-
      <p>Your gaze and your weapon strikes become one. Attempts by creatures to
      use a fear effect or the Intimidate skill on you provoke attacks of
      opportunity from you. If you hit&nbsp; such a provoking creature with the
      opportunity attack, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw
      against your maneuver DC or have the effect immediately
      canceled.&nbsp;</p><p>You have advantage on checks to penetrate nonverbal
      deception, such as Intelligence checks to disbelieve illusions and Insight
      checks to read another creatureâ€™s body language.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you
      learn how to replenish yourself even in combat. If you do not make any
      attacks in a round, at the beginning of your next turn you may roll your
      martial arts die and regain that much exertion. Once you do, you may not
      do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
