      dir="ltr">In addition to creating damaging blasts of elemental energy,
      elementalists are able to command and control elemental material at a
      distance. As an action, an elementalist can create effects at a range of
      30 feet, manipulating ambient elemental material to create any of the
      following effects. You must possess the proper elemental affinity to
      control an element.</p>

      per elementalist level can be moved up to 30 feet.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Elemental material up to a cubic foot can
      be reshaped (such as ice or stone), using your power in place of any
      required tool proficiencies. Shapes can be made in amorphous elements
      (like air, fire, or water), but the shapes only hold for as long as you
      spend an action.</p>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Fire can be used to ignite flammable
      material. It can be used to expand a fire up to 5-feet, provided fuel is
      present. It can extinguish flames as large as a 5-foot cube, or a 5-foot
      cubic portion. You can create and hold a flame in your hand without
      burning yourself.</p>
