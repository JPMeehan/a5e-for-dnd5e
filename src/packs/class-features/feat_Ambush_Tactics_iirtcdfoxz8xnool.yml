      <p>As an action you may select a number of friendly creatures equal to
      your Charisma modifier within range of your <em>Commanding Presence</em>.
      Once per turn when an affected creature hits with an attack and has
      advantage on the attack roll, the attack deals an additional 1d6 damage.
      You may select a new batch of creatures by spending another action. The
      effect persists for one minute. Once you have used this ability a number
      of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you canâ€™t do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
