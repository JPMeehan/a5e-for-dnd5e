      <p>Your attacks destroy the protective measures of your foes. When you
      score a critical hit, you may choose to either impose the broken property
      on your targetâ€™s armor or shield (if present) until it is repaired or you
      reduce the armor class of your target by -2 for one hour if it does not
      have armor or a shield. A given creature can only be affected by one
      instance of the -2 armor class reduction at a time.</p>
