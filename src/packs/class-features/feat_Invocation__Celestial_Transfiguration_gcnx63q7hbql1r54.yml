      <p>You infuse your body with a reflection of celestial light. You are
      immune to disease and resistant to radiant damage. As an action you can
      gain a flying speed of 90 feet that lasts for 1 minute. For the duration
      your spells, eldritch blasts, and weapon attacks deal additional radiant
      damage equal to your spellasting ability modifier. Once you have used this
      ability you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
