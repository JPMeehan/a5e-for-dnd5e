      <p>Over the course of 10 minutes, you may brief a number of creatures
      equal to your proficiency bonus. For one hour, as long as those creatures
      do not make attacks or cast spells with seen components, those creatures
      gain advantage on all checks to avoid notice or to appear not
      out-of-place. As long as these creatures share a language, they gain
      advantage on Deception checks to conceal messages that they sign to one
      another.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you may not use it
      again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
