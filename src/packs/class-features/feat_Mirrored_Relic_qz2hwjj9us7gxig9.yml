      <p>As you release your spiritual artifact it splits into numerous mirrored
      images. You add the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.05w9nzp0kvu94k3h]{Mirror Image}
      to your list of known wielder spells. In addition, when you animate your
      bonded artifact using your spiritual artifact feature, you may choose to
      cast the spell <em>mirror image</em> on your bonded artifact at 2nd level
      without expending any additional artifact charges as a part of the same
      bonus action. Spells you cast in this way are treated as if your bonded
      artifact cast them on itself.</p>
