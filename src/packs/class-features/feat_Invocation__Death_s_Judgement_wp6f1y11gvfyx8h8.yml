      <p>You gain a pool of Veil dice equal to your proficiency bonus which are
      1d4s. As a bonus action, you may expend one or more of these dice to roll
      them and target a creature within 30 feet. That creature either takes
      necrotic damage equal to the number rolled, or is healed for that amount.
      When healing a creature currently at 0 hit points, roll twice and take the
      higher result.</p><p>You regain all expended Veil dice when you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>
