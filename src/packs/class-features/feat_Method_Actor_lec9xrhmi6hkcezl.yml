      dir="ltr">At 17th level, when you don a disguise, you can do more than put
      on a costume: you can put on a second self. Whenever you complete a long
      rest, you may select a culture and background other than your own. At any
      point before the end of your next long rest, you may gain all of the
      features and languages of your chosen culture, as well as the skill
      proficiencies, tool proficiencies, language proficiencies, and background
      feature of your chosen background. These benefits last until the end of
      your next long rest unless you choose to end them early. Once you cease
      using this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long
      rest.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">This degree of investment in your character is mentally
      exhausting. At the start of each hour you spend using this feature after
      the first, you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 10 + the
      number of hours you have used this feature or gain a level of strife.</p>
