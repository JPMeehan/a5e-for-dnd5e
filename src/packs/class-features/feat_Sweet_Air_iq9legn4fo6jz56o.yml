      <p>At 6th level your magic passively purifies the air around you and fills
      your lungs with sweet air. You can hold your breath for an additional
      number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus and have advantage on
      concentration checks to avoid losing your breath. You also have advantage
      on saving throws against inhaled poisons and any spell or effect based on
      inhaling something harmful (such as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.orjiv7fbrikcns17]{Stinking Cloud},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.764ocg0phxmyw7y2]{Cloudkill}, etc.),
      and have resistance to any damage they deal.</p>
