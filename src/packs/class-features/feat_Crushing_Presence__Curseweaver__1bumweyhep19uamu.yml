      <p>At 18th level creatures affected by an Organizational effigy wielded by
      you must make a Wisdom saving throw when they enter the area of your
      Commanding Presence or start their turn there. On a failed save, an
      affected creature suffers the Slowed condition until the beginning of its
      next turn. Creatures affected by an Individual Effigy suffer the same
      effects, but suffer the Encumbered condition instead on a failed save and
      the Slowed condition on a successful one.</p>
