      <p>You can reach beyond your limits to draw more power from within. When
      you finish a short rest, you may expend a number of hit dice up to your
      Charisma modifier to regain some of your magic essence. For each hit die
      expended in this way, you regain 2 sorcery points. Once you have used this
      feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
