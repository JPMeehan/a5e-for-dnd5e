      <p>At 10th level, you’re confident enough to challenge even the most
      monstrous threats. You can use a bonus action to expend a use of Panache
      to challenge a creature within 30 feet to an honorable duel. Once you
      challenge a creature in this way, you have disadvantage on attacks against
      creatures other than the challenged creature, and the challenged creature
      has disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than you. A creature
      remains challenged in this way until either you or the challenged creature
      are incapacitated, dies, or either ends their turn out of line of sight
      from the other. The challenge also ends if you use this feature again to
      challenge a different creature, or if a third creature challenges either
      you or your challenged creature.</p>
