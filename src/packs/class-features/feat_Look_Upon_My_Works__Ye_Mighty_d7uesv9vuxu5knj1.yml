      <p>At 10th level, you automatically gain an average tier 4 Stronghold or a
      luxurious tier 3 stronghold. &nbsp;In addition, the gold and time required
      to build/upgrade a stronghold under your supervision is cut in half.
      &nbsp;You may only supervise the construction or expansion of a single
      stronghold at a time, and although you do not need to be physically
      present for the full building of it, you do need to visit the build site
      and check in at least once a month.</p>
