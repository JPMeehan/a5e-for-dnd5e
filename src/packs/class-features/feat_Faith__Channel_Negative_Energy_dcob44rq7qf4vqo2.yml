      <p>You can use an action to evoke baleful energy from the Lower Planes to
      harm creatures you are able to see. You choose the creatures. Each
      creature makes a Charisma saving throw or takes [[/r 5d10 #force]] force
      damage and [[ /r 5d10 #necrotic]] necrotic damage, or half damage on a
      success.</p><p>When you use this feature, you also choose one of the
      following conditions: blinded, confused, deafened, frightened, poisoned,
      rattled, or slowed. A creature that failed its saving throw also gains the
      chosen condition. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat
      the saving throw to end the effect on itself.</p><p>In addition, you can
      choose any number of creatures you can see that have the Evil alignment
      trait. Each regains [[/r 5d10 #hit points]] hit points.</p>
