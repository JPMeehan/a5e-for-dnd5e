      <p>Starting at 18th level, you have become better at withstanding common
      attacks you encounter when exploring the depths, shrugging off blows that
      would severely harm other adventurers. When you take damage, you can use
      your reaction to gain&nbsp;resistance</span>&nbsp;to bludgeoning,
      piercing, and slashing damage, as well as to acid, necrotic, and poison
      damage, until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when
      you finish a&nbsp;<span>long rest.</p></div><div>&nbsp;
