      <p>At 2nd level, you are immune to ingested&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">poisons</span>&nbsp;. This also allows you to eat
      and drink spoiled provisions without consequence. In addition, whenever
      you would make a Survival check to forage, you can make the check
      with&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">advantage</span>. If you do, any
      food you find is rotting and spoiled, making it inedible for most
      creatures.</p>
