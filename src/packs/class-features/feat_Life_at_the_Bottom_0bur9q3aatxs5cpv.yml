      <p>At 2nd level, you are immune to ingested&nbsp;poisons</span>&nbsp;.
      This also allows you to eat and drink spoiled provisions without
      consequence. In addition, whenever you would make a Survival check to
      forage, you can make the check with&nbsp;<span>advantage. If you do, any
      food you find is rotting and spoiled, making it inedible for most
      creatures.</p>
