      <p>At 10th level, whenever you use the Charge maneuver and are wielding a
      shield and no other weapons, choose one creature within 60 feet that can
      see you. The chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal your fighter
      level and an expertise die on its next saving throw. Once a creature has
      benefited from this feature, it cannot benefit from Galvanizing Charger
      again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
