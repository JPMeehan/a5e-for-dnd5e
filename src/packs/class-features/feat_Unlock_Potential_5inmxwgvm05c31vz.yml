      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can unlock a plethora of capabilities of
      your artifact, at least for a while. You may learn a relic art from the
      relic art list you don&rsquo;t currently know and meet the prerequisites
      for by spending 3 exertion points or artifact charges and 1 minute&rsquo;s
      work tinkering. You lose any relic arts you learn in this way whenever you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
