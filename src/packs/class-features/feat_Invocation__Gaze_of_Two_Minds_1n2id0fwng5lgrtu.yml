      <p>You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive
      through its senses until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns
      you can use a bonus action to maintain this connection, extending the
      duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the
      other creature&rsquo;s senses, you benefit from any special senses
      possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own
      surroundings.</p>
