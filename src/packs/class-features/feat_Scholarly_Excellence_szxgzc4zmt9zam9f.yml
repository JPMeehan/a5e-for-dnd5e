      <p>At 3rd level, you have a particular set of skills that sets you a cut
      above a novice mage. Choose one of the following: </p><h3><strong>Academic
      </strong></h3><p>You’ve got a whole lot of book smarts. You gain 4
      specialties from Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, and
      Religion. Unlike normal, academic specialties may be taken twice
      (increasing the specialty’s expertise die to 1d6). </p><p>In addition,
      when you use either Deception or Persuasion to make a point related to an
      academic specialty, you gain your expertise die from the specialty and use
      Intelligence for your ability check. </p><h3><strong>Ritual Efficiency
      </strong></h3><p>When you cast a spell as a ritual, you only add 1 minute
      to the casting time (instead of 10 minutes). </p><h3><strong>Rote
      Memorization </strong></h3><p>Choose one cantrip which has a casting time
      of 1 action and doesn’t deal damage. You can cast that cantrip as a bonus
      action without any seen or material components a number of times equal to
      your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when
      you finish a long rest, and can switch the cantrip associated with this
      feature each time you gain a wizard level.</p>
