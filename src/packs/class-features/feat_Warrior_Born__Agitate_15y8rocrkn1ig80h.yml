      <p>Many battles have taught you how to spot aggressive body language like
      a pursed eyebrow, tensed temple, or protruding vein, and you’ve mastered
      using these cues to unsettle others outside of combat. Make an
      Intimidation check opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see
      and hear within 20 feet. On a success, you subtly press the creature to
      act out. What exactly the creature does—back away quickly, blurt out
      something compromising, draw a weapon, look towards a concealed or
      disguised companion, protectively touch something it is carrying—is at the
      Narrator’s discretion.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot
      do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
