      <p>Beginning at 1st level, you have been granted the&nbsp;possibility to
      manipulate the forces of chaos, and&nbsp;bend it to your will to better
      your odds.</p><p>When rolling for an ability check, an attack, or a saving
      throw, you can replace any d20 with 2d10 instead. Roll the 2d10, sum them
      up, and use the result as you would use normally from a d20.</p><p>You
      must declare using this feature before rolling for your ability check,
      your attack or your saving throw. You can use this feature a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses on a
      long rest.</p>
