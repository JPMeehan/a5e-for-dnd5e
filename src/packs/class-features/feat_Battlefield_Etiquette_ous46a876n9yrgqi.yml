      <p>At 3rd level, you learn the unwritten rules of the battlefield. After
      you have fought beside a martial artist for an encounter, battled against
      them, or observed them for at least 10 minutes, you gain an expertise die
      on Charisma checks made to influence them. Any creature that has a martial
      arts die, knows a maneuver from a combat tradition, or possesses an
      exertion pool is considered to be a martial artist.</p>
