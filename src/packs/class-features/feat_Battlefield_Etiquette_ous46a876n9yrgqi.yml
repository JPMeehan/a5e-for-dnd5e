      <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the unwritten rules of the battlefield.
      After you have fought beside a martial artist for an encounter, battled
      against them, or observed them for at least 10 minutes, you gain an
      expertise die on Charisma checks against them. Any creature that has a
      martial arts die, proficiency with a combat tradition, or an exertion pool
      is considered to be a martial artist.</p>
