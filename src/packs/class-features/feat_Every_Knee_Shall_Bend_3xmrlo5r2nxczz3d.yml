      dir="ltr">At 6th level, you are able to more effectively exercise your
      will using your relic&rsquo;s power. When you cast a wielder spell that
      affects creatures with a certain number of hit points, for the purposes of
      determining which creatures are affected by the spell you may consider
      each creature the spell could effect to have its hit points reduced by a
      number equal to 10 times the level of the spell, down to a minimum of 1
      hit point.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, if you use your Issue Edicts feature to modify a
      spell that would otherwise target a specific number of creatures, you may
      instead choose to affect a 10-foot radius circle centered on a point you
      choose within range.</p>
