    value: >-
      <p>You may spend 2 sorcery points as an action to target a creature you
      can see within 30 feet. They must make a Wisdom saving throw or be
      frightened of you for 1 minute. They may repeat the saving throw at the
      end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. If they start
      their turn <em>blinded</em> or unable to see as a result of darkness, they
      count as being able to see the source of their fear, and if they start
      their turn <em>blinded</em> or in darkness they cannot see through they
      take 2d6 psychic damage. You may only have one creature frightened in this
      way at a time.</p>
