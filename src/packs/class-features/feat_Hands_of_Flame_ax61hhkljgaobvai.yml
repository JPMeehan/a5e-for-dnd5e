      <p dir="ltr">Also at 2nd level, you gain control over fire with a touch.
      You learn
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.c1qq11be32b3s1qr]{Fire Bolt} as
      a bonus cantrip, and you gain resistance to fire damage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You can also ignite flammable materials by touching them as a
      bonus action. You may also extinguish up to a 15-foot square of
      non-magical fire by spending an action to do so. You must be within 5
      feet&nbsp; of the fire in order to do this. The area you can extinguish
      grows to 25-foot square at 8th level and 50-foot square at 14th level.</p>
