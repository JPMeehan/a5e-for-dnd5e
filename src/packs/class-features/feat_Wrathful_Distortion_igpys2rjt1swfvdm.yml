      <p>At 14th level, your fury becomes so powerful that you can tear reality
      itself asunder. While raging, you can see into the Ethereal Plane and
      attack creatures there as if they were on the Material Plane.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You also learn to take short trips through the Ethereal Plane. While
      raging, you may spend 3 exertion points to be affected as per the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.kv7igcz0o825new0]{Etherealness}</em>&nbsp;spell
      until your rage ends.</p>
