      <p>It’s commonly thought that it’s best not to ask you for too much
      clarification or detail. You can always choose to use Constitution when
      making Deception checks.</p><p>In addition, when you fail a Deception
      check against a creature, it makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC
      equal to your passive Deception score. On a failure, it thinks twice about
      your dishonesty and your Deception check becomes a success.</p>
