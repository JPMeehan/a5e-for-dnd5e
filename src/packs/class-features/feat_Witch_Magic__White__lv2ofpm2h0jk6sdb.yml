      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">At 2nd level, you
      choose one of three broad magical paths you will walk: White Magic, Gray
      Magic, or Black Magic. The chosen path expands your witch spell list,
      adding additional spells to it. You can choose spells from this ability
      when preparing your spell list. If you would choose a spell that is not on
      the witch spell list, it is considered a witch spell for you.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">While there are
      definitely moral associations with these paths, it is more complicated
      than simply Black Magic as evil and White Magic as good. Black Magic tends
      to represent forces of both evil and chaos, while White magic represents
      both good and law, and there is overlap between the two. For a witch, both
      are two sides of the same coin, both necessary parts of magic as a whole,
      with Gray Magic being the balanced path between the two.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You add the law,
      good, radiant, and healing schools of magic to your list of witch
      spells.</p>
