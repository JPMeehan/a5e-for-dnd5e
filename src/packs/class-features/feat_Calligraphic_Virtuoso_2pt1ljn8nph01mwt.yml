      <p>You become especially proficient with using and creating magical items
      made of paper. The time and gp (base materials) cost to craft spell
      scrolls is halved for you. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, this
      discount can also apply to other items primarily composed of paper and
      text. You can also use bookbinder&rsquo;s tools or a battle book as your
      spellcasting focus.</p>
