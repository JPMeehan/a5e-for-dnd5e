      <p>You are at home in the depths, able to control your breathing and
      attune to the subtle movements of the water. You gain a swimming speed
      equal to your Speed and you add your Wisdom modifier to the number of
      minutes you can hold your breath before suffocating. In addition, while
      fully submerged in water you gain blindsight out to a range of 10
      feet.&nbsp;</p>
