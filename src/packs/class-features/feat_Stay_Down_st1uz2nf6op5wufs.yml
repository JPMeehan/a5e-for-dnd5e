      <p>Also at 7th level, when a target poisoned by you falls unconscious,
      they are harder to rouse. A creature attempting to wake such an
      unconscious creature must either deal damage to it equal to twice your
      proficiency bonus or must make a Medicine check against your maneuver DC
      to do so. Creatures wake naturally at the end of durations
      normally.</p><p>Creatures that you reduce to zero hit points also have
      disadvantage on their death saves.</p>
