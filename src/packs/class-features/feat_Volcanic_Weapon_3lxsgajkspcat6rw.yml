      <p>At 7th level, you have learned a potent ritual to enhance your weapons
      with the gifts of the volcano. You may perform this ritual, which takes an
      hour, on any piercing or slashing melee weapon. The weaponâ€™s cutting edges
      become razor-sharp volcanic glass and the weapon seethes with the heat of
      a volcano. While you (and only you) wield the weapon, successful attacks
      from the weapon do 1d4 ongoing damage for one minute unless an action is
      spent to stop the bleeding. The weapon also deals an additional 1d6 points
      of fire damage.</p><p style="text-align: start">If the weapon is already
      made with volcanic stone (such as an obsidian-edged macuahuitl or an
      obsidian dagger or spear) the damage from both sources increases by one
      step, to 1d6 and 1d8, respectively.</p>
