      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, your faith grants you access to some divine
      magic. Ecclesiarchs tend to focus on spells that bolster allied forces and
      manipulate the battlefield, but some may select more straightforward
      damage-dealing or the power to curse their foes as
      well.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips </strong></h3><p>At 3rd level, you know two
      cantrips of your choice drawn from the divine school. These spells count
      as marshal spells for you. You learn an additional cantrip at 10th
      level.</p><h3><strong>Spell Slots </strong></h3><p>The Ecclesiarch
      Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
      of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
      slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
      when you finish a long rest.</p><h3><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level or
      Higher </strong></h3><p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice
      from the divine school. The Spells Known column of the Ecclesiarch
      Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of your choice from
      this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have
      spell slots. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
      choose one of the spells you know from this feature and replace it with
      another qualifying spell of a level for which you have spell
      slots.</p><h3><strong>Spellcasting Ability </strong></h3><p>Wisdom is your
      spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your wisdom whenever a spell
      refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your wisdom
      modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when
      making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 +
      your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier </p><p><strong>Spell attack
      modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier</p>
