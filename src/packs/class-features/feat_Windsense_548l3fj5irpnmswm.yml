      <p dir="ltr">You can see through fog and mist as if they were transparent,
      though you know they are there. You can hear through rushing wind, such as
      storms, as if they weren&rsquo;t there. In windy areas, you can choose to
      see and hear as if you were in two places at once, both where you are and
      at an additional point. The additional point can be at a spot in the
      direction the wind is coming from, a number of feet away equal to the
      wind&rsquo;s speed in miles per hour, potentially allowing you to see and
      hear around corners and other obstacles.</p>
