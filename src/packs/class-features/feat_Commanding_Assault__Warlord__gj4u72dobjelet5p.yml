      <p>At 15th level you can choose to spend an exertion point to make a
      Commanding Assault when you take the attack action.</p><p>If you hit with
      an attack made as part of your attack action you can use your Commanding
      Presence without giving up an attack.</p><p>If you score a critical hit or
      reduce an enemy to 0 hit points with your first hit you can instead
      command 2 targets with Commanding Presence.</p><p>You cannot forgo an
      attack to use Commanding Presence normally in the same round.</p>
