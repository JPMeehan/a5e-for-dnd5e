      <p>Starting at 15th level, you have learned to tap into sources of power
      perhaps best left alone, lashing your injured foes with dark energies.
      Once per round, when you make an attack against a bloodied creature it
      takes necrotic damage equal to your herald level. This damage occurs
      whether the attack hits or misses, and is in addition to any damage from
      the attack. </p>
