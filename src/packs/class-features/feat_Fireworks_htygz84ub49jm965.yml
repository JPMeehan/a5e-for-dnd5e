      <p>Starting at 18th level, you infuse everything you do with spectacular
      magical ornamentation. When you roll initiative, you can activate your
      Fireworks (no action). This grants you advantage on Performance and
      Intimidation checks. While under the effects of Fireworks, you cannot make
      Stealth checks, you do not benefit from invisibility, and the noise of
      your magically-infused assault can be heard up to 300 feet away with no
      checks required. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius around yourself
      and dim light a further 30 feet beyond that.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, you
      can spend 2 exertion points as a bonus action to have all attacks you make
      until the end of your turn benefit from Demoralizing Prowess. When you do,
      you must pick a different damage type each time Demoralizing Prowess
      triggers. In addition, the severity of the effects of your attacks
      increases. If a creature fails a second saving throw in the same round
      against your Demoralizing Prowess, it is also blinded until the end of its
      next turn. If it fails a third, it is also stunned for that
      duration.&nbsp;</p>
