      <p>While grave knights are a varied bunch, they typically share a few key
      beliefs in common.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Embrace the end.</strong> Death comes for everyone and
      everything. Even gods perish in time. Remember this, but also remember
      always that death need not be the end.</li>

      <li><strong>Terror.</strong> Few can look into the face of death without
      fear. The same should be true for you.</li>

      <li><strong>Endurance.</strong> Victory belongs to those who can
      persevere, even past the veil of mortality if need be.</li>

      </ul>
