      <p>You can make spectacular, devastating attacks which inspire awe in
      those nearby. When you miss with a weapon attack while taking the Attack
      action, you can choose to hit instead. Alternatively, you can choose to
      change a hit with a weapon attack into a critical hit, or when you score a
      critical hit you can choose to deal maximum damage. All hostile creatures
      who see your Finishing Blow make a Wisdom saving throw against your
      maneuver DC or become frightened for 1 minute.</p><p>Once you use this
      feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
