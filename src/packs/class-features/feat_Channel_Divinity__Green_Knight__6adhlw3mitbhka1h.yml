      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
      Channel Divinity options.</p>

      <h2>Blessing of Nature</h2>

      <p>For the next hour, you have advantage on Persuasion checks made to
      influence druids and beasts. Alternatively, you can end the blessing early
      to gain advantage on a Survival check made to find Supply or a haven in
      the wilderness.</p>

      <h2>Rely on Nature</h2>

      <p>When you fail a Nature or Survival check, you can use your reaction to
      succeed instead.</p>
