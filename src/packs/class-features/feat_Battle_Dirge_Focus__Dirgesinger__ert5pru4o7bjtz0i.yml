      <p dir="ltr">Also at 4th level, as soon as battle commences your mind
      focuses on manipulating the creatures before you. At the end of another
      creature&rsquo;s turn, you can use your reaction to activate a battle
      dirge. This battle dirge replaces any currently activated battle dirge.
      Replacing an activated battle dirge does not require expending a use of
      Mind-Numbing Chant if it has no target yet.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, choose one of the following.</p>

      <ul>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Your battle dirges no longer require
      concentration.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Your battle dirges spread like a
      mind-virus; when a creature fails a save against your battle dirge, or
      chooses to accept the dirge without making a save, you may immediately
      target another creature to affect with the same battle dirge. You may do
      this a total number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, not
      including the initial dirge.</p>

      </li>

      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You learn an additional battle dirge that
      does not count against the number of battle dirges you can know. When
      choosing this battle dirge, you are treated as having 4 more dirgesinger
      levels for the purpose of meeting its prerequisites. If you change this
      Battle Dirge Focus, you forget the additional battle dirge.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p dir="ltr">Whenever you gain a dirgesinger level, you may change your
      Battle Dirge Focus.</p>
