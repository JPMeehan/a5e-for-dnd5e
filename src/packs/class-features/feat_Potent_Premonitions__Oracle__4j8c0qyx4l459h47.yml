      <p>Starting at 8th level, your premonitions are more powerful. Your
      Unfickle Fate feature now lasts up to 8 hours. In addition you gain one
      premonition per long rest. Roll a [[/r d20]]. You may apply its number to
      the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw of a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
