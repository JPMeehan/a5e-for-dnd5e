      20th level, the common love shared between you and your allies fuels your
      combat prowess. Whenever a creature takes the Help action within the range
      of your Sacred Aura after initiative is rolled, they add an additional
      [[/r 2d8]] to your next divine smite damage, up to a maximum number of
      bonus damage dice equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of [[/r
      2d8]]). You lose all of this bonus damage if you do not use it by the time
      combat ends.</span></p>
