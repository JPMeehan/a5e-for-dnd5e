      <p>Immediately before rolling initiative, you can spend 2 sorcery points
      to cast a spell of up to 3rd-level that has a casting time of 1 action or
      1 bonus action. The spell activates before any other actions in
      initiative, but doing so uses your action for your first turn in the
      combat.</p>
