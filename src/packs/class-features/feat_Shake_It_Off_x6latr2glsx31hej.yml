      <p>If a friendly creature within the range of your Commanding Presence
      feature deals damage to the source of an effect that has caused it to
      become confused, frightened, or rattled, it gains an additional free
      saving throw against the effect, ending it on a success. If the creature
      successfully saves, it also regains hit points equal to 1d4+your Charisma
      modifier.</p>
