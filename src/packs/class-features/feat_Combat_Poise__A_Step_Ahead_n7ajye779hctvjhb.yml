      <p>You have a deft ability to predict your opponentsâ€™ responses and
      interfere with them. Whenever a creature within your reach that you are
      aware of attempts to take a reaction, you can expend your reaction for the
      round to try to disrupt them. That creature must make an Intelligence
      saving throw against your trick DC. If they fail, their reaction is
      wasted.</p>
