      <p>At 11th level, you never let your guard down entirely; not even when
      you are asleep. Being asleep does not impede your Perception checks based
      on senses other than sight or your passive Perception score, and you may
      choose to wake up in response to any detected stimulus. You can also stand
      up as a reaction, and if there is an unattended weapon you are proficient
      with in your space or an adjacent space, you may wield that weapon as part
      of the same reaction.</p>
