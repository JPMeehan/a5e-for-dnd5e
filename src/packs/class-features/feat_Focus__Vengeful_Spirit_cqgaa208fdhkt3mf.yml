      <p><em>Requirement: 15th level</em></p><p>When you make a death saving
      throw, you can choose to set your own spirit loose as a vengeful ghost to
      stalk your prey. The spirit acts on your initiative, has your statistics,
      ethereal copies of your equipment, full hit points, and half your exertion
      pool. Your vengeful spirit is resistant to piercing, bludgeoning, and
      slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. It can move through other
      creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it takes [[/r
      1d10 #force]] force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p><p>The
      vengeful spirit targets only the creature who reduced you to 0 hit points.
      When the creature is defeated, the spirit returns to your body. While the
      vengeful spirit is active, you don’t need to make death saving throws, but
      you still suffer automatic failures if you are hit. You can’t use this
      feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
