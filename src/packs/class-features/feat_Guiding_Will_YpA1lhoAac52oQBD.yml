      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.c16b46enmxlur04y]{Find the
      Path} spell at will without expending spell points.&nbsp; When doing so it
      does not require concentration and lasts until you visit the chosen
      location or until you cast it again rather than 24 hours.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you may choose a specific immovable location you
      have not been to before.&nbsp; Once you have used this option, you may not
      do so again until you have visited the chosen location.</p>
