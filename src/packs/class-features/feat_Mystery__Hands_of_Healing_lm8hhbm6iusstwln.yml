      <p>You gain a pool of points equal to your witch level. As an action you
      may touch a creature and spend any number of these point to heal them for
      that many hit points. You may instead spend 5 points from this pool to end
      a disease or poison affecting a creature. You may end multiple diseases
      and poisons with a single use, expending hit points separately for each
      one. This ability has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
