      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You gain a pool of
      points equal to your witch level. As an action you may touch a creature
      and spend any number of these point to heal them for that many hit points.
      You may instead spend 5 points from this pool to end a disease or poison
      affecting a creature. You may end multiple diseases and poisons with a
      single use, expending hit points separately for each one. This ability has
      no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
