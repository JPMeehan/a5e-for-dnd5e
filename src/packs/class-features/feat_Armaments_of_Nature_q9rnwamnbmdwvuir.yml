      <p>Starting at 15th level, you are able to call upon the wilderness to
      supply you with armor and weaponry. You can use an action and expend one
      use of&nbsp;
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.s4iiatrup3e3virw]{Channel
      Divinity} to cover yourself in bark, rock, soil, and vines for 1
      hour.</p><p>For the duration, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
      proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, and
      when a creature starts its turn and is grappling you, it takes 2d6
      piercing damage.</p><p>In addition, you can use a bonus action to grow a
      melee weapon into your hands. You are proficient with the weapon and it
      deals 1d12 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the
      weapon&rsquo;s shape). While wielding the weapon, your reach increases by
      5 feet. The weapon cannot be disarmed, but it can be damaged (AC equal to
      your herald spell save DC and hit points equal to your herald level).</p>
