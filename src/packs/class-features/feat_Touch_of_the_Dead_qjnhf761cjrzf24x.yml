      <p>Also at 1st level, you have learned how best to harness certain
      necrotic energy and push its potential to the limits. You learn the Chill
      Touch Cantrip, which does not count against your number of known cantrips.
      Furthermore, you can add your wisdom modifier to the damage you deal by
      any spell of 1st level or higher that deals necrotic damage.</p>
