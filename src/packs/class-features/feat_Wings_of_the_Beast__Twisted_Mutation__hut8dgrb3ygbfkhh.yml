      <p>At 6th level your power grows as your altered physiology adapts to the
      life you&rsquo;ve led up to this point. You may choose one of the
      following abilities and are not bound by your flesh and bone
      selection.</p>

      <p><strong>Wings of the Beast</strong>: You grow a pair of broad,
      leathery, wings not unlike those of a bat or a dragon. You gain a fly
      speed of 40ft. In addition, if you possess the beastmantle bonded power
      you may now make your tail attack as a ranged weapon attack. It has a
      range of 20/60 and flings poisoned spines. Your tail&rsquo;s damage
      increases to 1d10 piercing damage plus Constitution modifier poison damage
      and any creature damaged becomes poisoned for 1 minute.</p>
