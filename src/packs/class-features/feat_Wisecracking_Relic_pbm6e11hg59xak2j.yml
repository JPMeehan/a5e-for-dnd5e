      <p>Your bonded artifact has a mind and voice all their own, and they can
      sometimes win people over where you could not. Whenever you fail on a
      Persuasion or Intimidation check, you may have your bonded artifact repeat
      the check potentially turning a failure into a success. The outcomes of
      these successes may differ at the narrator&rsquo;s discretion, as it is
      the bonded artifact that has succeeded and not you.</p>
