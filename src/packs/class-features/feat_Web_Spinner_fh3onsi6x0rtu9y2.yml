      <p>At 11th level, you gain the ability to spin ropes and nets from magical
      spider silk. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 exertion point to conjure
      one of the following magical webs:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Rope:</strong>&nbsp;You conjure a 50-foot-long rope made of
      magical spider silk. The rope weighs 1 pound but can support up to 8,000
      pounds. It has an AC of 14, 10 hit points, and can be burst with a
      Strength check equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus.</li>

      <li><strong>Net:&nbsp;</strong>You conjure a net made of webs. It weighs 1
      pound and functions as a normal net weapon, with the following
      modifications: It has a range of 20/60, can trap creatures of up to Huge
      size, and has an AC of 14 and 20 hit points. The DC of the Strength check
      to escape the net is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus. You can create
      a stronger net by spending more exertion; for every additional point you
      spend, the net&rsquo;s hit points increase by 10.</li>

      <li><strong>Whip:</strong>&nbsp;You conjure a whip made of spider silk.
      The whip functions as a +1 whip.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Regardless of what form your webs take, they dissolve after 1 hour.</p>
