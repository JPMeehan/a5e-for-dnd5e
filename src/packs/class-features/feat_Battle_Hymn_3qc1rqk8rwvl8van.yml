      <p>Like music, battle can be wild and chaotic, and through the sensible
      use of formula and talent order can be brought with a dedicated change of
      tune. At 1st level, you learn a battle hymn. It can be expressed in any
      way you like -- a special leitmotif in your music, a change in pitch, or
      even a more advanced version of your favorite art.</p><p>Once at the start
      of your turn, you can activate a battle hymn by expending a use of Bardic
      Inspiration (no action is required). Performing a battle hymn requires
      your concentration, as though you were casting a spell. Once activated, a
      battle hymn continues until you lose concentration or the start of your
      next turn.</p><p>The number of battle hymns you know are listed in the
      Battle Hymns Known column of the Bard table. Whenever you gain a bard
      level, you may swap one battle hymn you know for a new battle
      hymn.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>. Unless stated otherwise a battle
      hymn does not have a target until you choose one, and each targets a
      single creature within 30 feet. You may choose to target a creature at any
      point, but after targeting a battle hymn its target cannot be
      changed.</p><p><strong>Sustained Song</strong>. When you have an activated
      battle hymn but have not chosen a creature to benefit from it yet, at the
      start of your turn when it would end you can instead choose to sustain the
      battle hymn until the start of your next turn without expending a use of
      Bardic Inspiration.</p>
