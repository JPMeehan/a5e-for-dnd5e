      <p>Starting at 17th level, you can recognize a flaw in a creatureâ€™s
      defenses. As your Cunning Action, you can study a creature. You gain
      advantage on all attacks and contested ability checks against that
      creature. This benefit lasts for 24 hours or until you study a different
      creature.</p>
