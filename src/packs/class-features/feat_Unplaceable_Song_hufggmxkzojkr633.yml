      <p>Also at level 6, you learn to throw off those searching for you, even
      as you taunt them. While you are hidden, obscured, or invisible, your
      voice and the sound of musical instruments you play seem to come from
      everywhere or nowhere in particular, imposing disadvantage on checks to
      locate you by sound. If you remain still while singing or playing music,
      you cannot be located by their sound alone.</p>
