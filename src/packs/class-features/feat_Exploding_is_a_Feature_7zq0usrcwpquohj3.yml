      <p>These overloads aren&rsquo;t a bug, they&rsquo;re a feature! When you
      use a bonus action to perform a wild experiment you may choose the
      Overload result instead of rolling. In addition, you gain resistance to
      damage caused by the overload result of your wild experimentation
      feature.</p>
