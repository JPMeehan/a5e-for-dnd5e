      <p>At 10th level, you inflict mental harm upon a creature when it makes a
      saving throw against an enchantment or illusion spell you have cast. A
      creature that fails its saving throw takes an amount of psychic damage
      equal to your Intelligence modifier, twice as much psychic damage if it
      succeeds. A creature can only be damaged by your Stern Rebuke once every
      24 hours.</p>
