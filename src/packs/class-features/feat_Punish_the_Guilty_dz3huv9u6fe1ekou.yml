      <p>At 7th level, you become especially effective at bringing down the
      wicked. As a bonus action, you may designate a creature for which you have
      a warrant, that you have marked with your Render Verdict feature, that has
      an Evil alignment, and/or that is of the aberration, fey, fiend, or undead
      types. You have advantage on attacks against that creature and on ability
      checks to capture it for one minute. Once you have used this feature a
      number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once) you must
      finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.</p>
