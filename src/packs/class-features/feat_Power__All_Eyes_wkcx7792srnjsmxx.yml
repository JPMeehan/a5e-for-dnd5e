      <p>You gain an expertise die on Performance and Persuasion checks. In
      addition, you can use your magic to make your presence known. As a bonus
      action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to put out a subtle pulse that
      causes all creatures within 60&nbsp;feet to take notice of you, allowing
      you to speak and be heard even in the midst of chaos. During combat, this
      notice lasts only a split secondâ€”not long enough to distract, but allowing
      you to make a Charisma check as part of the bonus action used to activate
      this feature.</p>
