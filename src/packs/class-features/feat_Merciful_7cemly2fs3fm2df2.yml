      <div>In exchange for forgoing bloodshed&mdash;torture, attacking
      unconscious creatures, and dealing lethal wounds to creatures you reduce
      to 0 hit points&mdash;you are yourself granted mercy. When you have
      already succeeded on two death saving throws, you have advantage on death
      saving throws.</div>
