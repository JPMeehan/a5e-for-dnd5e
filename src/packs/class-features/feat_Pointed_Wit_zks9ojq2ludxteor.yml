      <p>At 13th level, choose one of the following options.</p>

      <h2>Conversational Parry</h2>

      <p>You can reroll a failed Deception check and use the second result. Once
      you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a
      rest.</p>

      <h2>Disarming Manner</h2>

      <p>You have advantage on ability checks made to make peace or end
      hostility.</p>

      <h2>Verbal Riposte</h2>

      <p>When a creature threatens you or attempts an Intimidation check against
      you, you can use your reaction to make an Intimidation check against the
      creature with advantage. On a success, the creature is frightened of you
      for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again
      until you finish a rest.</p>
