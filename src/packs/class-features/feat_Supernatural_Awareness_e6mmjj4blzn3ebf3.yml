      minute:</p><ul><li><p>1st-level spell slot: You gain <em>darkvision</em>
      out to a range of 60 feet.</p><p>This darkvision treats magical darkness
      as non-magical darkness. If you already have darkvision, its range is
      extended by 60 feet, but you are still only able to see through magical
      darkness up to 60 feet. This effect may be activated multiple times,
      extending the range of both effects by 30 feet for each use after the
      first.</p><p></p></li><li><p>2nd-level spell slot: you gain
