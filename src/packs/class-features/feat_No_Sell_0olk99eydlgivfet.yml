      <p>Starting at 6th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use
      your reaction to spend 1 exertion and reduce the impact. After damage is
      determined (including any resistances you might have), roll your martial
      arts die. Reduce the damage you would take by that amount.</p>
