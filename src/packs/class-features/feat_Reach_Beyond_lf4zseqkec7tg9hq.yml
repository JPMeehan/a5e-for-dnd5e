      <p>Also at 1st level, your mind opens to a broader spectrum of magic than
      most. You can use a bonus action to attempt to replace one of your
      archetype spells. Declare which spell you’re trying to replace and make a
      Charisma saving throw (DC 10 + the spell’s level). On a success, you
      replace the spell with another archetype spell of the same or lower level
      until you finish a long rest, at which point the original spell returns.
      This newly-gained spell can’t be replaced again.</p><p>On a failure, the
      spell you’re attempting to replace goes off, expending no spell slots but
      targeting a creature or point within range of the Narrator’s choice
      (possibly yourself). The spell is too wild to alter with metamagic, and if
      it requires concentration it lasts its full duration with no concentration
      required instead. The archetype spell you attempted to replace is then
      removed from your spell list until you finish a long rest, at which point
      it returns.</p>
