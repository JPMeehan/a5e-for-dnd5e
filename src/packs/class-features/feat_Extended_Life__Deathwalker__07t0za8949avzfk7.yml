      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">At 10th level, you
      can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or
      sleep, although you still require rest to reduce fatigue and strife and
      still benefit from finishing short and long rests.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In addition, your hit
      point maximum cannot be reduced, and you gain resistance to necrotic
      damage.</p>
