      <p>Also at 6th level, you gain the ability to smash through protective
      measures. You gain the following additional Furious Critical ability which
      does not count against your furious critical options known:
      </p><h3><strong>Sundering Blow</strong></h3><p>Your attacks destroy the
      protective measures of your foes. When you score a critical hit, you may
      choose to either impose the broken property on your targetâ€™s armor or
      shield (if present) until it is repaired or you reduce the armor class of
      your target by -2 for one hour if it does not have armor or a shield. A
      given creature can only be affected by one instance of the -2 armor class
      reduction at a time.</p><p>In addition, while you are raging, any weapon
      you wield gains the Breaker property.</p>
