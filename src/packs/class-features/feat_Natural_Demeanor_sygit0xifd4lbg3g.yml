      <p>At 3rd level your connection to the natural world comes forth and
      becomes omnipresent. Choose one of the following:</p><h3><strong>A WAY
      WITH ANIMALS</strong></h3><p>Beasts understand anything you verbally
      communicate in Druidic, and you can comprehend them in return. The
      knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence,
      but at minimum beasts can give you information about nearby locations and
      monsters, including whatever they have perceived within the past day. At
      the Narrator’s discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to
      perform a small favor for you. In addition, you gain an expertise die on
      Animal Handling checks.</p><h3><strong>FIRST-HAND
      NATURALIST</strong></h3><p>You’ve learned the intricacies of nature
      through firsthand experience rather than academic study.&nbsp;</p><p>You
      gain an expertise die on Nature checks. In addition, you may always choose
      to use Wisdom when making Nature checks.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>LEYLINE
      AWARENESS</strong></h3><p>Druidic rituals attune you to the leylines that
      course through the Material Plane. While you are on the Material Plane,
      you always know the following information:</p><p>Which way is
      north.</p><p>The direction of the nearest forest.</p><p>The direction of
      the nearest natural body of water.</p><p>The direction of the nearest city
      or other humanoid community.</p><p>The general health of the local
      ecosystem, and if anything unnatural or magical is upsetting the natural
      order.</p><h3><strong>SCHOLAR OF OLD WAYS</strong></h3><p>Your circle
      taught the old magic at the root of all things, granting you eldritch
      insights beyond mundane arcane studies.</p><p>You gain proficiency with
      Arcana, or if you already have proficiency you instead gain an expertise
      die on Arcana checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom
      when making Arcana checks.&nbsp;</p>
