      <p>At 3rd level your connection to the natural world comes forth and
      becomes omnipresent. Choose one of the following:</p><h3>A Way with
      Animals</h3><p>Beasts understand anything you verbally communicate in
      Druidic, and you can comprehend them in return. The knowledge and
      awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum
      beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters,
      including whatever they have perceived within the past day. At the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to
      perform a small favor for you. In addition, you gain an expertise die on
      Animal Handling checks.</p><h3>First-Hand Naturalist</h3><p>You&rsquo;ve
      learned the intricacies of nature through firsthand experience rather than
      academic study.&nbsp;</p><p>You gain an expertise die on Nature checks. In
      addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making Nature
      checks.&nbsp;</p><h3>Leyline Awareness</h3><p>Druidic rituals attune you
      to the leylines that course through the Material Plane. While you are on
      the Material Plane, you always know the following
      information:</p><ul><li>Which way is north.</li><li>The direction of the
      nearest forest.</li><li>The direction of the nearest natural body of
      water.</li><li>The direction of the nearest city or other humanoid
      community.</li><li>The general health of the local ecosystem, and if
      anything unnatural or magical is upsetting the natural
      order.</li></ul><h3>Scholar of the Old Ways</h3><p>Your circle taught the
      old magic at the root of all things, granting you eldritch insights beyond
      mundane arcane studies.</p><p>You gain proficiency with Arcana, or if you
      already have proficiency you instead gain an expertise die on Arcana
      checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making
      Arcana checks.&nbsp;</p>
