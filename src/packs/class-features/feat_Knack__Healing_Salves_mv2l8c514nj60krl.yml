      <p>Once between long rests you can spend an hour to collect natural
      ingredients and concoct an ointment that speeds healing. This salve is
      potent for 24 hours and has a number of uses equal to 1 + your Wisdom
      modifier. As an action, you can use the salve to restore 1d4 hit points to
      a creature within reach.</p>
