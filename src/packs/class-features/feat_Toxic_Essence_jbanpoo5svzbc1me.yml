      <p>Beginning at level 9, your continued exposure to toxins and chemicals
      alters your physiology. You are resistant to poison damage and your blood
      becomes toxic to other creatures. Whenever another creature hits you with
      a bite attack, it takes 2d6 poison damage.  You can also use your own
      blood as a means to fuel your abilities. If you would use basic poison,
      you may spend your reaction to deal 1d6 points of necrotic damage to
      yourself, allowing you to use your own blood as a single dose of basic
      poison.</p>
