      <p>Beginning at level 6, your subtle ways extend to your actual use of
      magic, rather than merely the activities around it. When you cast a spell
      from the Obscurement school, you may double its normal duration. You may
      use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier,
      recovering all uses upon finishing a short or long rest.</p><p>Also, when
      given time, you can conceal your spellcasting altogether. When casting a
      spell, you may make a Deception check to conceal the spellâ€™s origin. A
      creature attempting to determine where a spell came from must beat the
      result of this check with a Wisdom (Insight) check to know you cast the
      spell.</p>
