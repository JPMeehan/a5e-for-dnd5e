      <p>By 5th level you are intimately familiar with the need for preparation.
      You may declare that you have made secret preparations you are only
      revealing now. You must make a DC 15 check with a skill of the Narrator's
      choosing to see if these preparations were successful. Examples include: I
      found this ancient map previously and am only now revealing it, I just
      happened to have this exact medicine on my person, or I anticipated the
      king might arrest us and so bribed a guard to leave a key under this loose
      brick. Such a benefit cannot grant a magic item, and any equipment or item
      it grants should cost less than 100 x your proficiency bonus in gold. Once
      you have successfully used this ability, you cannot do so again until you
      have leveled up.</p>
