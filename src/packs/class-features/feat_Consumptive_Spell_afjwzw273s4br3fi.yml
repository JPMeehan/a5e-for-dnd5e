      <h4>When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 4 sorcery
      points. You, or a creature within 10 feet of you, regain hit points equal
      to half the damage roll for the spell. If you roll damage multiple times
      for a spell, you only restore hit points from the first roll.</h4>
