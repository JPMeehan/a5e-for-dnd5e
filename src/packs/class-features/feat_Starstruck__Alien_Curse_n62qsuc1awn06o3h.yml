      <p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see
      within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target
      dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following
      effects:</p><ul><li><p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature,
      it takes an additional [[/r 1d4 #psychic]] psychic damage. This bonus
      increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th
      level.</p></li><li><p>You gain a pool of beyond dice, which begins empty.
      Each beyond die represents a sliver of the future revealed by the use of
      this gift from your patron. When the cursed creature fails a saving throw,
      add one beyond die to this pool. You can spend a beyond die when making a
      saving throw to gain a [[/r 1d4]] bonus. The pool disappears when you
      finish a short or long rest.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this
      feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
