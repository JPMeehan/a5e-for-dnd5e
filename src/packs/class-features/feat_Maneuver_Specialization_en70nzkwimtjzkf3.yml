      <p>As you experience combat and perfect your techniques they get easier
      for you to perform and more difficult for your foes to overcome. At 3rd
      level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level you may choose to
      master a combat maneuver you know.&nbsp;You cannot master the same
      maneuver more than once in this way.</p><p>The exertion point cost of
      mastered maneuvers is reduced by 1 (minimum 1).</p><p>Your maneuver DC for
      mastered maneuvers increases by 1.</p><p>Any attack you make as part of a
      mastered maneuver (including triggering attacks) deals 2 additional
      damage.</p>
