    value: >-
      <p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to alter its
      components in subtle ways. A creature attempting to identify the spell
      based on its components perceives it as a different spell of your choice,
      of the same or lower level. Attempts to&nbsp;counterspell&nbsp;this spell
      are made at disadvantage.</p>
