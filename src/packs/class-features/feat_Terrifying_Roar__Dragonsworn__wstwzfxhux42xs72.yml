      <p>At 10th level as an action, you let out a supernaturally loud roar
      infused with dragonfear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span></p><p>You can force all creatures of your choice within 60 feet to
      make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On a failure they are frightened
      of you for 1 minute. Frightened creatures may repeat the save at the end
      of each of their turns, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p><p>This counts as a dragon's fear ability for the Draconic
      Curse ability.</p><p>Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so
      again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
