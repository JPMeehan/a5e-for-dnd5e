      <p>At 6th level when you critically hit a target you may throw everything
      into slaying your target, trusting in your faith to defend you. You may
      expend any accumulated rage hit points and deal additional radiant or
      necrotic damage with the attack equal to that amount. This damage is not
      multiplied as part of a critical hit.</p>
