      <p>Even if you don&rsquo;t currently own a mount, you have grown up around
      horses and other beasts of burden and know how to handle them and keep
      them calm in almost any situation&mdash;even in the heat of battle. You
      gain proficiency in Animal Handling, or an expertise die if you were
      already proficient. Mounts and pack animals in the service of you or your
      allies that are within the range of your Commanding Presence have
      advantage on saving throws made to resist fear.</p>
