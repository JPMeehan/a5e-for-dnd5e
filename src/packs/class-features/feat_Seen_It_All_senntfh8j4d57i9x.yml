      <p>At 15th level, knowledge and experience shield your mind. You have
      resistance to psychic damage and you gain advantage on saving throws to
      prevent gaining levels of strife. In addition, whenever you finish a long
      rest outside a  sanctuary, you recover a level of strife. Whenever you
      finish one inside a sanctuary, you recover two levels of strife
      instead.</p>
