      <p>Starting at 5th level, you can direct your companions so effectively
      that they can use the techniques youâ€™ve mastered. You learn one additional
      combat maneuver from the Sanguine Knot tradition. This combat maneuver
      does not count against the number of combat maneuvers that you
      know.</p><p>In addition, when a creature uses your Commanding Presence to
      make an attack, it can simultaneously use one Sanguine Knot combat
      maneuver that you know. If the creature does not have any exertion points
      to spend on combat maneuvers, it does not require exertion points for that
      use but it cannot benefit from Combat Directives again until it has
      finished a short or long rest.</p>
