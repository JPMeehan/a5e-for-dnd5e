      <p>At 9th level, you can draw upon your oath for extra assistance in
      social situations. Choose one of the following
      features.</p><p><strong>Lend Faith </strong><em>When an ally within 30
      feet that can see and hear you would make a saving throw or ability check
      you can inspire them with your faith, adding your Charisma modifier to the
      roll. Once you have used this feature you can't do so again until you
      finish a short rest.</em></p><p><strong>Reveal Heresy</strong><em> You
      gain proficiency in the Insight skill, and gain an expertise die on to
      Insight checks. Whenever a creature is lying to you, it makes a Charisma
      saving throw against a DC equal to your passive Insight score. This save
      is made with disadvantage and done in secret by the Narrator. On a
      failure, you get a strong sense that they are being
      untruthful.</em></p><p><strong>Truth of Conviction </strong><em>Whenever
      you or an ally are telling the truth and make any Charisma ability check
      to do so, you can use this feature to treat any roll of 10 or less as an
      11 for that roll. Once you have used this feature you can't do so again
      until you finish a short rest.</em></p>
