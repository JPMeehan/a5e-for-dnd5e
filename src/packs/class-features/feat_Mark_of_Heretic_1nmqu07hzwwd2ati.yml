      <p>Beginning at 7th level, you gain the ability to mark your foes for
      judgment by speaking aloud their name and the crime they must answer for.
      As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
      The target is marked for 1 minute, or until either you or the target die.
      While the target is marked, you gain the following benefits:</p><p>•
      Damage rolls you make against the creature deal extra damage equal to your
      spell attack modifier.</p><p>• Attacks made by you or your allies score
      critical hits against the creature on a roll of 19–20.</p><p>• The
      creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or it becomes outlined in a nimbus
      of light (of a color chosen by you) for the duration. This nimbus of light
      negates the benefits of invisibility on the creature.</p><p>If the marked
      target is not killed or captured within 1 hour, you have disadvantage on
      melee weapon attacks made against other creatures until you finish a short
      or long rest.</p><p>You gain an additional use of this feature at 15th
      level. You regain all spent uses of this feature whenever you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>
