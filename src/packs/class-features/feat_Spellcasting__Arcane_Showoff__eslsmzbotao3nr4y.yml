      <p>Also at 3rd level, you have trained in magic, granting you the power to
      cast spells. Showoffs tap into arcane power, and focus on magic that
      enhances their prowess in the most dramatic and spectacular ways
      possible.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>At 3rd level, you
      know two cantrips of your choice, chosen from the following schools:
      attack, movement, prismatic, sound, transformation, and weaponry. These
      spells count as fighter spells for you. You learn an additional cantrip at
      10th level.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Spell Slots</strong></h3><p>The
      Arcane Showoff Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to
      cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
      must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Spells
      Known of 1st-Level or Higher</strong></h3><p>You know three 1st-level
      spells of your choice from the chosen from the attack, movement,
      prismatic, sound, transformation, and weaponry schools. The Spells Known
      column of the Arcane Showoff Spellcasting table shows when you learn more
      spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Additionally, when
      you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know
      from this feature and replace it with another qualifying spell of a level
      for which you have spell slots.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Spellcasting
      Ability</strong></h3><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your
      spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
      ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the
      saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
      one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Charisma modifier<br><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your
      proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
