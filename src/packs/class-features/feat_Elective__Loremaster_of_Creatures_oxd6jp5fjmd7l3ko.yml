      <p>You are well-studied on naturally occurring creatures of the world.
      When you choose this study, choose one creature type: beasts, constructs,
      dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, oozes, plants, or undead. This
      creature type becomes your Loremaster Creature Specialty. When you
      encounter a creature of the same type as your Loremaster Creature
      Specialty, you automatically know any history, legends, or myths related
      to it.</p>
