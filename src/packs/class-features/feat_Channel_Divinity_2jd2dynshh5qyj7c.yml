      <p dir="ltr">Also at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel
      Divinity options.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Elemental Weapon.</strong></em> As an action, you
      can imbue one weapon that you are holding with energy, using your Channel
      Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls
      made with that weapon (a minimum bonus of +1), changing the damage type
      the weapon deals to that of your element. The weapon emits bright light in
      a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not
      already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You can end this effect on your turn (no action required). If
      you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall
      unconscious, this effect ends.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Rebuke Elementals.</strong></em> As an action,
      you present your holy symbol and utter a word of elemental power, using
      your Channel Divinity.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Each Elemental within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you
      must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or
      until it takes damage.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Creatures who fail this save by 5 or more regard you as their
      master for the duration. While they are under this effect, you may use
      your action to issue simple commands (no more than a sentence or two)
      which they are compelled to obey. They will not take any action that is
      obviously harmful to them, and so will not leap from a great height, jump
      onto a sword, or purposefully self-inflict any damage. They follow the
      command until you issue a new one.</p>
