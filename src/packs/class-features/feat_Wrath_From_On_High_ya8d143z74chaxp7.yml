      <p>At 18th level, your Divine Infusion no longer decreases the size of the
      dice converted from some other form of damage to radiant or
      necrotic.</p><p>In addition, if you are at least 30 feet above your target
      or the spellâ€™s damage source originates from above (such as in the case of
      <em>flame strike</em>, <em>call lightning</em>, or <em>moonbeam</em>) your
      spells deal an additional <strong>1d8</strong> of your choice of radiant
      or necrotic damage.</p>
