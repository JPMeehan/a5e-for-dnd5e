      <p>Your moral compass aligns with the transcendent forces of the
      multiverse. Choose Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, or one of the following:
      Chaotic and Evil, Chaotic and Good, Lawful and Evil, or Lawful and Good.
      You gain the chosen alignment trait or alignment traits. You can identify
      creatures that have the same alignment traits as you, and you have
      advantage when making Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks against
      them.</p><p>Additionally, you do not suffer negative effects from being on
      a plane with which you share an alignment trait.</p>
