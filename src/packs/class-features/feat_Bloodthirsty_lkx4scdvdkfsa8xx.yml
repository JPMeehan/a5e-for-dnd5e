      <p>At 11th level, you and creatures friendly to you within the area of
      your Commanding Presence do an additional 1d4 of necrotic damage with
      their weapon attacks, and any creature reduced to 0 hit points by an
      affected creature immediately accrues one failed death save.</p>

      <p>In addition, as long as you have at least two allied creatures in the
      area of your Commanding Presence, you all gain an expertise die on
      Intimidation checks.</p>

      <p>Finally, you and your allies within your Commanding Presence gain
      advantage on all attacks made against incapacitated creatures and
      noncombatants. If ayou or an ally would already have advantage on the
      attack, you deal an additional 1d4 of necrotic damage instead, which stack
      with the bonus damage above.</p>
