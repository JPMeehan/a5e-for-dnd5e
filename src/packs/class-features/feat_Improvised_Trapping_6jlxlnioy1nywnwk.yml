      at 10th level, as a bonus action, you may deploy up to two thrown items
      such as a flask of
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.4t0m2ttaca5hg2vi]{Alchemist's
      Fire} or a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.ukcav3i8dudpalir]{Tanglefoot
      Bag} into up to two spaces within 15 feet of you. If a creature moves into
      that space, it is affected as if you had hit it with the thrown object.
      You can deploy the items into the same space or separate spaces as you see
      fit. You may retrieve an item that hasn't been activated as an action from
      any adjacent space.</span></p>
