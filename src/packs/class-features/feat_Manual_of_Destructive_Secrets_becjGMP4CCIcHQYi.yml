      decode magic sigils of power in your Book of Shadows. You may add one
      spell each of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level from any class list to your tome.
      These count as warlock spells for you, do not count against your maximum
      number of spells known, and you may cast each of these spells once per
      long rest without expending spell points.</span></p>
