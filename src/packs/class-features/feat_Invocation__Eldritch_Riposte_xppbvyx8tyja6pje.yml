      <p><em>Prerequisite: Eldritch Disturbance or Eldritch Ray
      feature</em></p><p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet deals damage
      to you, you can use your reaction and spend spell points to use your
      Eldritch Disturbance or Eldritch Ray against it. Instead of the normal
      damage, you deal 1d10 force damage for every 1 spell point spent
      activating this feature (up to a maximum equal to your proficiency
      bonus).</p>
