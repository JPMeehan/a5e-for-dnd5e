      <p>At 17th level, you learn the most coveted of all arachnid guardian
      abilities: the fearsome ethereal shifting of phase spiders. As a bonus
      action, you can spend 3 exertion points to shift to the Ethereal Plane. At
      the end of every minute you remain on the Ethereal Plane, you must spend 1
      exertion point; otherwise, you immediately shift back to the Material
      Plane. You can return to the Material Plane deliberately as a bonus
      action, and doing so costs no exertion.</p>
