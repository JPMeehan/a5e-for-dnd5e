      <blockquote><p>You become a full Proscriber, and receive additional
      training.</p></blockquote><p>Choose four spells from the
      <em>Knowledge</em> school of a level you can cast and add them to your
      spellbook. All future <em>Knowledge</em> spells you add to your spellbook
      are added at 25% of the usual cost in both time and materials. Spells of
      the <em>Knowledge</em> school are always Wizard spells for you, though
      other wizards cannot learn them from you unless they normally appear on
      the wizard list.</p><p>You also gain an exertion pool with 3 points of
      exertion in it, or, if you already have an exertion pool, it increases by
      3 points. You learn the <em>Purge Magic</em> maneuver. If you already know
      it, you may choose another 1st-degree maneuver from the <em>Tempered
      Iron</em> school or from another combat tradition that utilizes or
      nullifies magic.</p>
