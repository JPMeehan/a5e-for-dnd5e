      <p>At 3rd level you gain proficiency with your choice of the Persuasion,
      Intimidation, or Deception skills. If you are already proficient with all
      three, you instead choose one to gain expertise and gain proficiency with
      another skill from the scholar list. In addition, you gain an expertise
      die on all checks with the chosen skill. At level 7 this increases to a
      d6, at level 10 it increases to a d8 and your maximum size for expertise
      die on the chosen skill increases to d10, and at level 14 increases to a
      d10 and your maximum size for expertise die on the chosen skill increases
      to d12. You may always choose to use Intelligence on checks with the
      chosen skill.</p><p>You add
