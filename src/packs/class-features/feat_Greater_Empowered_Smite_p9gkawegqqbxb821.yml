      <p>At 8th level you learn the following new empowerments for your smites,
      and can use this feature twice at no cost in between long rests.
      Alternatively, you can use an empowered smite by expending a spell slot of
      1st-level or higher.</p>

      <h2>Blinding Smite</h2>

      <p>The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is
      blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can
      repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>

      <h2>Disorienting Smite</h2>

      <p>Your smite instead deals psychic damage and the target makes a Wisdom
      saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1
      minute. At the end of each of its turns the target can repeat the saving
      throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>

      <h2>Taunting Smite</h2>

      <p>The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes an
      additional 1d6 radiant damage when attacking a creature other than you and
      cannot make opportunity attacks against anyone but you. This effect lasts
      up to 1 minute, and the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
      each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
