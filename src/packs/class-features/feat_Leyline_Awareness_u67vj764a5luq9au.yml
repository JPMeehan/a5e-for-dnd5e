      <p>Druidic rituals attune you to the leylines that course through the
      Material Plane. While you are on the Material Plane, you always know the
      following information:</p><ul><li>Which way is north.</li><li>The
      direction of the nearest forest.</li><li>The direction of the nearest
      natural body of water.</li><li>The direction of the nearest city or other
      humanoid community.</li><li>The general health of the local ecosystem, and
      if anything unnatural or magical is upsetting the natural order.</li></ul>
