      <p>At 15th level, in addition to a minor metamagic option, you gain one
      major metamagic option. These are more powerful expressions of your
      magics, though they come at significantly higher costs. You gain an
      additional major metamagic option at 20th level.</p>

      <h2>Consumptive Spell</h2>

      <p>When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 4 sorcery
      points. You, or a creature within 10 feet of you, regain hit points equal
      to half the damage roll for the spell. If you roll damage multiple times
      for a spell, you only restore hit points from the first roll.</p>

      <h2>Contingent Spell</h2>

      <p>When you cast a spell, rather than have it go off immediately, you can
      spend 6 sorcery points and describe an external condition. When that
      condition occurs before you finish a long rest, you can use your reaction
      to cast the spell. You can only have one Contingent Spell at a time.</p>

      <h2>Echo Spell</h2>

      <p>When you cast a spell of 5th-level or lower, you can spend sorcery
      points equal to the sorcery point conversion cost for a spell slot of that
      level (see Table: Creating Spell Slots). The spell repeats on the next
      turn, originating from the same point and aimed at the same target as the
      first instance of the spell.</p>

      <h2>Intense Spell</h2>

      <p>Before rolling damage for a spell or seeing the result of any saving
      throws or attack rolls for the spell, you can spend sorcery points equal
      to the spell&rsquo;s level. The spell deals its maximum possible damage to
      one target.</p>
