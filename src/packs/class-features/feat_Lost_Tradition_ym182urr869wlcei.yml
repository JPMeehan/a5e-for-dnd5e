      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your training unlocks lost knowledge. Choose a
      combat tradition you are not proficient in. You become proficient in that
      tradition. When you use a combat maneuver that requires a weapon with a
      particular property (such as finesse or heavy), your unarmed strikes count
      as having that property.</p>
