      <p dir="ltr">You can use the Disarm, Grapple, Knockdown, and Shove
      maneuvers at a range of 60 feet, but only targeting metal objects or
      creatures made of or wearing significant amounts of metal (such as metal
      armor). When using Shove, you can choose to move the creature in any
      direction. When used against a creature, the normal size category
      restrictions are ignored. If you disarm a creature, you can pull the item
      to yourself as long as it weighs less than 5 lbs per level, otherwise it
      falls in the creature&rsquo;s space</p>
