      <p>When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction
      to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your adept level.
      If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is possible
      to do so (the missile is small enough to hold, you have a hand free). If
      you catch the missile, as part of this reaction you can spend 1 exertion
      to make a ranged weapon attack with the weapon or ammunition you just
      caught. The missile counts as an adept weapon and you have proficiency for
      the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60
      feet.</p>
