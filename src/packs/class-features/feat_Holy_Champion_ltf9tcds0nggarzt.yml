      <p><strong>Tenets of the Holy Champion</strong></p><p>All holy champions
      hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they serve.</p><p>• Lead by
      Example. Strive to embody the principles of your deity, and inspire others
      to do the same.</p><p>• Life In Service. When your deity calls, you
      answer, and all you do is in dedication to them.</p><p>• Quick of Mind.
      Steel yourself against psychic attacks that may sway you from
      service.</p><p>• Strong of Body. Peak physical condition must be
      maintained, in order to serve to the best of your
      abilities.</p><p><strong>Archetype School </strong></p><p>Add the good and
      radiant schools of magic to your list of herald spells (or if you are an
      unholy champion, the evil and necrotic schools of magic).</p>
