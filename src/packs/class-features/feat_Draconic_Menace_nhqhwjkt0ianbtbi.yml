      <p>At 10th level, you take on some of the terrifying aspects of
      dragonkind. While you are raging, a hostile creature that begins its turn
      within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom save against your maneuver DC or
      be rattled until it moves more than 10 feet away from you or you stop
      raging. A creature that fails the save by more than 5 is frightened in
      addition to rattled. A creature that fails the save by more than 10 also
      gains a level of strife.</p>
