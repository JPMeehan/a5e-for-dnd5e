      <p dir="ltr">Starting at 2nd level, you can animate an undead creature and
      bind it to you. Choose the corpse or pile of bones of a humanoid or beast
      creature with a CR of 1/4 or less, which has a size of medium or smaller.
      The creature gains the zombie or skeleton template, as appropriate.</p><p
      dir="ltr">If the creature you reanimate has spell slots, it does not
      regain any used spell slots upon being reanimated, nor upon completing a
      short or long rest.</p><p dir="ltr">The undead has its own turn, rolling
      its own initiative, and acts on its own turn. The undead won&rsquo;t
      attack except as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other
      actions as normal. In addition, whenever the undead rolls initiative, it
      gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your wizard level
      multiplied but your proficiency bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">As a bonus action
      on your turn, you can order the undead to take an action on its turn. If
      you order the undead to attack, it adds your proficiency bonus to attack
      rolls.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p>
