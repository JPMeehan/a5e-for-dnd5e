      following:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Choose a point you can see within 60 feet. Large or smaller creatures
      on the ground within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">saving throw</span>&nbsp;against your spell save
      DC, falling&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">prone</span>&nbsp;on a
      failure.</li>

      <li>Sprouting rock formations erupt around you in a 5-foot radius. The
      ground in this area is&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">difficult
      terrain</span>&nbsp;for creatures other than you until the end of your
