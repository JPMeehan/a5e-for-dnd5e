      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the ability to learn magic rituals and
      cast them. You acquire a spellbook. When you find a spell with the ritual
      tag, you can transcribe it into your spellbook if the spellâ€™s level is
      equal to or less than the highest-level herald spell you can cast. For
      each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs
      50 gold for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. Once a spell is
      transcribed in this manner, you can cast it as a herald spell.</p>
