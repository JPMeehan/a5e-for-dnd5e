      <p>At 11th level your practice has finally smoothed out the early faults
      of your spell inventions, so long as you keep the arcane power within
      acceptable parameters. Whenever you roll a 1 on the fizzle die, you may
      reroll it, if you do you must use the new result.</p><p>In addition, your
      spell inventions have become streamlined enough that other creatures can
      make sense of them. A creature holding one of your spell inventions can
      use an action to make an Engineering check (DC equal to your spell save
      DC). On a success the spell is cast at its lowest possible spell level, or
      on a failure the spell fizzles out and fails to cast. Whenever a creature
      attempts to cast a spell using one of your spell inventions in this way,
      roll the fizzle die as normal.</p>
