      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, as an action you can use your Channel Divinity
      to shunt a single inanimate object that you are holding that weighs nor
      more than 1/4th of the amount you can carry into an extradimensional
      space. If the object is a food item, it instantly loses its nourishing
      qualities and if it is a body, it can never be restored to life. The
      object remains in the extradimensional space for a maximum number of hours
      equal to your proficiency bonus, after which it appears at your feet. At
      any time before then, you may use your reaction to retrieve the object in
      response to whatever you wish. It either appears at your feet or in your
      hands as you choose.</p>
