      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, as an action you can use your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.s4iiatrup3e3virw]{Channel
      Divinity} to shunt a single inanimate object that you are holding that
      weighs nor more than 1/4th of the amount you can carry into an
      extradimensional space. If the object is a food item, it instantly loses
      its nourishing qualities and if it is a body, it can never be restored to
      life. The object remains in the extradimensional space for a maximum
      number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, after which it appears at
      your feet. At any time before then, you may use your reaction to retrieve
      the object in response to whatever you wish. It either appears at your
      feet or in your hands as you choose.</p>
