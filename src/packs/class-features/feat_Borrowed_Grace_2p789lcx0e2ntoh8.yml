      <p>You can directly channel power from the upper planes, whether the gods
      will it or not. At the end of each long rest, you gain a Channel Divinity
      feature. This feature must be from a cleric archetype and granted to
      clerics of 2nd level.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you can instead gain Turn
      Undead with the benefit of two instances of the Destroy Undead
      empowerment. This latter options gains a third instance of such an
      empowerment at 14th level, and a 4th at 17th level.</p><p>Once you have
      used the chosen cleric feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
