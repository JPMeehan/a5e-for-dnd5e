      <p>Regardless of the cause that drives them forward all conquerors hold
      similar tenets.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>No Quarter. </strong>Surrender may be accepted if you dictate
      total and absolute terms, but for those that resist there is no
      mercy.</li>

      <li><strong>Crush Hope. </strong>So long as the enemy believes they can
      fight they will resist. Correct them of their mistake.</li>

      <li><strong>Ever Advance. </strong>It is not enough simply to defend what
      you have. Whether by ancestral right, divine right, or the right of might
      you seek to press on and expand your holdings, be they land, possessions,
      or prestige.</li>

      <li><strong>Iron Will, Iron Body.</strong> You must show total conviction
      in your choices, no matter what doubts you bury within, and maintain the
      personal strength of arms to back them up. An army is only as strong as
      its head.</li>

      </ul>
