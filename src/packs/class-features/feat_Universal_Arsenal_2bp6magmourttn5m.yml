      <p>Your prior training taught you quite a lot, but still left gaps in your
      knowledge that you are determined to plug. At 3rd level, when you select
      this archetype, choose 4 rare weapons. You become proficient in them all.
      In addition you are also proficient with improvised weapons and your
      unarmed strikes do base damage of 1d4.</p>
