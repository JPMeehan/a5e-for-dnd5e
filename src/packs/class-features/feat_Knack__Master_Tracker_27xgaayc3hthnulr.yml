      <p><em>Prerequisite: 9th level</em></p><p>You can spend 5 minutes looking
      at a 30-foot diameter outdoor area to study the ground and other clues.
      You learn all events which transpired in that area in the last 24 hours as
      though you had witnessed them yourself, although you do not learn secret
      information not obvious to an observer. The information you gain is only
      that which would be learned by sight; you do not gain sound-based
      information or learn what creatures in the area said to each
      other.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p>
