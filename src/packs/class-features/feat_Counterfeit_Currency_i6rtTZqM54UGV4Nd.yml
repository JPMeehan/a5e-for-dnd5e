      expertise die in checks using a forgery kit increases to 1d10. In
      addition, you have mastered the dastardly art of coin clipping and
      counterfeiting banknotes and bonds. You may maintain a rich lifestyle
      without paying for it, and you earn double the amount of gold when
      performing the Illegal Work downtime activity when making checks using a
      forgery kit. When performing this downtime activity, you may choose to
      attempt work of a Nearly Impossible difficulty, which requires a DC 30
      check, affords a rich lifestyle, and rewards [[/r 10d6 * 3]] gold (before
      doubling). If you are not caught during this downtime activity, you are
      assumed to have successfully exchanged your false funds for genuine
      money.&nbsp;</span></p>
