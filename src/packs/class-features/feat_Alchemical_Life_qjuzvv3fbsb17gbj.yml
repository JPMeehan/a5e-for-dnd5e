      <p>At 10th level you gain the ability to create a homunculus. This
      requires 8 hours of work and 2000 gp of reagents. It also requires you to
      shed some of your blood, dealing between 2d4 and 12d4 piercing damage
      chosen in multiples of 2d4. This damage cannot be reduced by any means,
      and your maximum hit points are reduced by this amount until the
      homunculus is destroyed. The homunculous uses the stats from the Monstrous
      Menagerie except its maximum hit points are increased by the amount of
      damage you took creating it. You can only have one homunculus at a
      time.</p>
