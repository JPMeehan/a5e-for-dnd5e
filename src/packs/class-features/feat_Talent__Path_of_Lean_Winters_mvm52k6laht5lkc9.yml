      <p>The lessons of the snows have put you beyond mere cold and hunger. You
      gain advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of cold weather
      as though you were wearing cold weather gear, but without the
      disadvantages in hot weather. Additionally, you can go without Supply for
      a number of days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1)
      before suffering a level of fatigue.</p>
