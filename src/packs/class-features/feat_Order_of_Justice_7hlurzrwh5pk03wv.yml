      gain a level 5 stronghold of average quality of the castle, temple, or
      training hall type, and two seasoned followers chosen from the diviner,
      healer, interpreter, sage, or smith types. At the Narratorâ€™s option, you
      can place this stronghold somewhere unusual or purchase upgrades for it at
      the normal cost as part of the acquisition process. You also gain the
      services of two NPCs of up to CR 5. </p>
