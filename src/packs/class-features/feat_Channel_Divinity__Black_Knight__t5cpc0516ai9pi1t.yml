      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
      Channel Divinity options. </p><p><strong><em>Accursed Wound</em></strong>
      When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can use your channel divinity
      to curse the wound (no action required). The target of the attack takes an
      additional 1d8 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw
      against your spell save DC. If the target fails, it cannot regain hit
      points until it finishes a long rest. If it succeeds, its maximum hit
      points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage done by your attack
      until it finishes a long rest.</p><p><strong><em>At a Momentâ€™s
      Notice</em></strong> You may perform an hour-long ritual to mark a suit of
      armor, and either a pair of weapons or a weapon and a shield. Thereafter,
      you may use your channel divinity as a bonus action to summon the marked
      items onto your body. The armor appears on your body and any weapon or
      shield appears in your hands. If you are wearing different armor or are
      carrying other items, they appear in a neat pile at your feet. This effect
      works at any distance, provided your marked items are on the same plane as
      you.</p>
