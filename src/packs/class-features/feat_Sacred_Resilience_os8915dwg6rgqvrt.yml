      <p>Also at 7th level, your devotion and supernatural power benefit your
      allies. When a friendly creature inside the area of your Commanding
      Presence recovers hit points, if the number of hit points recovered is
      determined by a die roll, the creature may reroll any die rolls of 1,
      using the new value if it is better. </p>
