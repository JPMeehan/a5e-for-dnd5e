      <p>Any instrument played by passing air through it qualifies as a wind
      instrument. When using this musical art as a spell focus, whenever you
      cast a bard spell you can make a Deception or Performance check. Any
      observers with a passive Insight score equal to or less than the result of
      your check do not see or hear you cast the spell. Once you have used this
      feature three times, you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
