      <p>At 6th level, you have become inured to the long, mind-numbing hours of
      a sentryâ€™s post or patrol and have learned to stay alert for extended
      spans of time. You can ignore the effects of one level of
      fatigue.</p><p>Your eyes have also become unusually good at picking out
      movement and detail that others might miss. You can take the Search action
      in combat as a bonus action.</p>
