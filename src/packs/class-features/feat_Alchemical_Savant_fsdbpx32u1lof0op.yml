      <p>Starting at 3rd level when you choose this archetype you gain
      proficiency with alchemist's supplies if you do not have it already. If

      of their choice. You also gain an expertise die on checks made with
      alchemist's supplies. At level 7, this die increases to d6. At 10, it
      increases to d8 and your maximum size of an expertise die on checks with
      alchemist's supplies increases to d10. At level 14, this die increases to
      a d10 and your maximum size of expertise die on checks with your
      alchemist's supplies is d12. You may always choose to use Intelligence on
      checks with alchemist's supplies.</p>
