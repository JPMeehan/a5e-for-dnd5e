      <p>You can spend 10 minutes instructing another creature in the use of a
      tool or skill you have proficiency with to give them proficiency on the
      next check they make using that tool or skill within the next hour.
      Alternatively, you can simultaneously give this instruction to a number of
      creatures no more than twice your proficiency bonus, in which case they
      all gain proficiency on the next group check they make using that tool or
      skill within the next hour. Once a creature benefits from this bonus, it
      cannot do so again until it completes a short or long rest.</p>
