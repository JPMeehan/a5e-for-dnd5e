      <p>At 9th level, you have created a flair that you use when casting
      spells. Choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a long
      rest, you may replace your flair with another.</p><p>Whenever you cast a
      spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose to cast it with your flair.
      You can do so again when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Awe and
      Wonder</h2><p>Choose one creature affected by the spell. It must succeed
      on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next
      turn. While charmed in this way, it is incapacitated, has a movement speed
      of 0, and does nothing but stare blankly at the dazzling effects of your
      magic. If it takes any damage or is forced to make another saving throw,
      the charm effect ends.</p><h2>Terror</h2><p>Choose one creature within 30
      feet that can see you when you cast the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom
      saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn.
      While frightened in this way, it starts its turn by using its full
      movement to get away from you in the most direct manner possible, avoiding
      obvious hazards along the way.</p><h2>Brilliance</h2><p>Choose one
      creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the spell. It must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its
      next turn.</p><h2>Warding</h2><p>After casting the spell, until the start
      of your next turn, a creature who attempts to attack you must make a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must choose a new target or waste
      its attack.</p>
