      <p>You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When you fail on a
      Deception check against a humanoid, you can use a combination of fasttalk
      and your magic to make them forget your misstep, spending 1 sorcery point
      to reroll the check. On a success, their memory skips a beat and fills in
      the gap with your new story. On a failure, not only do they not believe
      you, but anyone who can cast spells and observed the exchange (including
      your target, if applicable) knows that arcane subterfuge was
      attempted.</p>
