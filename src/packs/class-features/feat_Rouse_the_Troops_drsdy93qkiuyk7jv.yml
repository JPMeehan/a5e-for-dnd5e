      <p>Also at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute speaking words of
      encouragement and support to reinvigorate your companions. Each friendly
      creature that can hear or understand you can spend any number of hit dice
      to regain hit points without having to finish a short rest. In addition,
      each creature that does spend at least one Hit Die in this way can remove
      one level of fatigue or strife it is suffering from. Once a creature has
      removed a level of fatigue or strife from your use of this class feature,
      the creature must finish a long rest before it can do so again.</p>
