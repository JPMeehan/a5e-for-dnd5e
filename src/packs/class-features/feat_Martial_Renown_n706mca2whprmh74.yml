      <p>At 6th level, tales of your deeds take root in the hearts of the
      people. As a leader, you are more famous than most adventurers. You add
      half your proficiency bonus to your Prestige rating.</p>

      <p>In addition, your reputation strongly affects how you are perceived,
      and when it becomes known that you are in a settlement people treat you
      accordingly. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, there may be settlements
      (such as an enemy&rsquo;s war camp) where you cannot utilize this feature.
      Choose one of the following:</p>
