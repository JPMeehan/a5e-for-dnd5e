      <p>At 7th level, you focus your training to become better at a particular
      aspect of search and rescue. Choose one of the following options:</p>

      <h2>Never Lost</h2>

      <p>The size of the expertise die granted by your Familiar Terrain feature
      increases by one step, to a maximum of 1d10. In addition, as long as you
      are on a plane you have spent at least a week on, you always know which
      way is north, and you always know how much time you have until sunset.</p>

      <h2>Rescuer&rsquo;s Instincts</h2>

      <p>You are especially good at finding those who need your help. You gain
      an expertise die on Perception and Investigation checks to find creatures
      that are injured or in distress. If a creature wants to be found or is
      unconscious, you also make these checks withadvantage.</p>

      <h2>Trustworthy and Compassionate</h2>

      <p>Your good intentions, when genuine, are self-evident. When you are
      telling the truth, creatures automatically succeed on Insight checks to
      determine your honesty. In addition, you have advantage on Persuasion
      checks to convince other creatures to help you help someone else.</p>
