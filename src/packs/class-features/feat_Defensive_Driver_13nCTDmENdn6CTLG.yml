      <p>You gain proficiency with a type of vehicle, or an expertise die if you
      are already proficient. You may spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed
      ability check related to vehicular activity, such as tool checks to repair
      a vehicle, Acrobatics checks to keep balance on a moving vehicle, or
      Animal Handling checks to calm animals drawing a vehicle. Likewise, if you
      are piloting a vehicle, you may spend 2 exertion to reroll a saving throw
      made by the vehicle. In both cases, you may choose whether to use the new
      roll or the original.</p>
