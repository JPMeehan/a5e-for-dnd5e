      dir="ltr">Your artifact is cursed, and while you have learned to cope with
      it, you have not managed to suppress its effects entirely. When you select
      this archetype, select one of the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Unmoored:</strong> You permanently suffer the Bewildered
      mental stress effect.</li>

      <li><strong>Paranoid:</strong> You permanently suffer the On Edge mental
      stress effect.</li>

      <li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Troubled:</strong> You
      permanently suffer the Sleepless mental stress effect.</li>

      <li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Fettered:</strong> Your movement
      speeds are reduced by 10 feet.</li>

      <li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Gravebound:</strong> When a
      critical hit is scored against you, make a DC 15 Constitution save. On a
      failed save, you immediately drop to 0 hit points.</li>

      </ul>

      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Your artifact affliction is an inherent
      part of your bond with your bonded artifact and is unaffected by spells
      such as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.l16wg9h1z9s16exb]{Remove
      Curse},@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel
