      energies. When you select this relic art choose one of the following
      damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, psychic, or radiant.
      Once per turn when you deal damage to a target with a weapon attack or
      spell attack using your bonded artifact you can choose to deal an
      additional d6 damage of the chosen type. You may select this relic art
      multiple times and choose a different damage type each time. If you do,
      you may select any of your chosen damage types when you choose to deal
      additional damage.</p>
