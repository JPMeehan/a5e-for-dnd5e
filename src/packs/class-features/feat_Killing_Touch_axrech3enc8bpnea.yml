      <p>At 17th level, you learn the most terrifying technique of all, the
      killing touch. When you hit with a melee attack, you may declare that you
      are using your killing touch ability. If you do, the creature you struck
      has fewer than 100 hit points, it is immediately slain. If the creature
      has 100 hit points or more, your attack deals damage as normal and the
      creature also takes an additional 50 points of necrotic damage.
      </p><p>Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you
      have finished a long rest.</p>
