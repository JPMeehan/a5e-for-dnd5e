      <p class="preFade fadeIn">At level 6 you gain the ability to alter the
      very terrain of the battlefield. As a bonus action you can render a 30
      foot diameter area within 100 feet difficult terrain for 10 minutes. If
      you have already created difficult terrain using this feature, that effect
      is ended when you create new additional terrain.</p>

      <p>If you expend a 3rd-level or higher spell slot when you activate this
      feature, you may choose one of the following enhancements:</p>

      <ul data-rte-list="default">

      <li>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn">The area of your difficult terrain is 50 feet in
      diameter.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn">The area of your difficult terrain is a 100-foot
      line.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn">The area of your difficult terrain is a 50-foot
      cone.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn">A number of allies equal to your proficiency
      bonus is unaffected by the difficult terrain.</p>

      </li>
