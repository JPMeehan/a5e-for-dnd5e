      <p>Beginning at 7th level, at the end of each short rest, you can craft a
      number of trick arrows equal to your proficiency bonus, each costing 1
      gold worth of raw materials, as well as an equal amount of ammunition
      (augmented arrows cannot be used for this purpose). When you craft each
      trick arrow, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. On a
      successful hit, a trick arrow deals 1d8 damage of the chosen type (which
      counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity)
      in addition to that of the ammunition.</p><p>Due to their bulky nature,
      you can only use one trick arrow per Attack action (though you can still
      make your remaining shots with normal ammunition) and can only hit targets
      within your weapon&rsquo;s normal range. Additionally, the materials of a
      trick arrow are unstable and lose their efficacy when you next take a
      short rest, though the materials can be repurposed for a new trick
      arrow.</p>
