      <p>Also at 4th level, your self-awareness and discipline allow you to draw
      upon deeper reserves of willpower than other warriors. Your exertion pool
      increases by the amount listed in the Bonus Exertion column of Table:
      Adept. For example, at 4th level your exertion pool increases to 5, at 5th
      level when your proficiency bonus increases your exertion pool becomes 7,
      at 6th level your exertion pool becomes 8, and so on.</p>
