      <p dir="ltr">At 3rd level, your chosen focus on light or dark becomes more
      powerful.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Gloom of Deceit</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">If you choose Path of the Dark, you now suppress light by one
      level within a range of 30 feet. (Bright light becomes dim light, dim
      light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes magical darkness). You may
      suppress this darkness (no action required) or reactivate it as a bonus
      action. While this darkness is active, illusions within its area become
      more potent. Creatures witnessing an illusion in the area have
      disadvantage on saves to disbelieve them, and creatures failing such a
      save become rattled. Creatures attempting an Insight check on you also do
      so with disadvantage.</p>
