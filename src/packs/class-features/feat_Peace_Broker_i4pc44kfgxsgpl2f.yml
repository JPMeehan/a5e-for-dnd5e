      you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Insight
      and Persuasion. If you are already proficient with either skill, you
      instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain the reading emotions
      specialty in Insight and the peacemaking specialty in Persuasion. Finally,
      you learn the friends cantrip, or another bard cantrip if you already know
      it.</span></p>
