      <p>Also at 9th level, darkness, even magical darkness, no longer impedes
      your vision. You gain darkvision to 60 feet. If you already have
      darkvision,&nbsp; instead the range of your darkvision increases by 60
      feet. Your darkvision can pierce magical darkness, treating it as dim
      light.</p>
