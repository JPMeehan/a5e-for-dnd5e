    value: >-
      <p>You may cast the planar ally and planar binding spells once each per
      long rest at their lowest spell level. They count as warlock spells for
      you. When cast in this way planar ally always summons a genie of your
      chosen type and the cost of any services are halved. When casting the
      planar binding spell the material component is instead a vessel such as a
      lamp, bottle, or ring worth at least 1000 gp that is not consumed, though
      you may only have one creature bound within it at a time. As an action you
      may force a bound creature into this vessel, or call it forth.</p>
