      <p><em>Requirement: Deflect Missiles, 9th level</em></p><p>When you are
      hit by a ranged spell attack that deals damage, you can use your reaction
      and spend 2 exertion to deflect the magic. When you do so, the damage you
      take from the attack is reduced by 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your
      adept level.</p><p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can spend 1 exertion
      to redirect the spell to another target within 30 feet of you as part of
      the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency using your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
