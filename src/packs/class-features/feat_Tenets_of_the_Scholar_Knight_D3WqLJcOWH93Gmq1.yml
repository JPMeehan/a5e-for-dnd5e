      <p>All scholar knights hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they
      serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Rigor. </strong>Be sure you know what you know. Go beyond
      quick answers and surface information.</li>

      <li><strong>Integrity.</strong> The truth, however inconvenient or
      distasteful, is still better than a lie.</li>

      <li><strong>Excellence. </strong>Keep your skills, both mental and
      physical, sharp through training and practice.</li>

      <li><strong>Curiosity. </strong>No matter how much you know, it can always
      be more. Cultivate a curious mind.</li>

      </ul>
