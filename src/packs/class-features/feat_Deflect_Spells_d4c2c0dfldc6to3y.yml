      <p>When you are hit by a ranged spell attack that deals damage, you can
      use your reaction and spend 2 exertion to reduce the damage by 2d10 + your
      Dexterity modifier + your adept level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you
      can spend 1 exertion to redirect the spell to another target within 30
      feet of you as part of the same reaction. Your bonus for this attack is
      equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
