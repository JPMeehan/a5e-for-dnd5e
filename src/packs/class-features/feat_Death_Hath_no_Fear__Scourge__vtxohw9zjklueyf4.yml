      <p>At 18th level if an allied creature within your Commanding Presence
      that can see or hear you would be reduced to 0 hit points but not killed
      outright, you can use your reaction to instill in them a fear greater than
      death. They instead drop to 1 hit point, they are immune to damage until
      the end of their next turn (though they must still make a Constitution
      saving throw or die if they would take massive damage without this
      immunity), and they have advantage on attack rolls until the end of their
      next turn.</p><p>However, they are also frightened of you for the next
      minute. You cannot use any spell or ability to remove this frightened
      condition, though other creatures can, and if a targeted creature is
      normally immune to fear they lose that immunity for the duration. This
      also still counts as being reduced to 0 hit points for the purposes of
      gaining fatigue or strife at the end of combat.</p><p>Once you have done
      so, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
