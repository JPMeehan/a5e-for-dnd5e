      <p>Also at 3rd level, you become superlative at preparing your fellows for
      battle. Your allies must spend at least 10 minutes a week discussing
      strategy with you to benefit from this feature, at which point you spend a
      number of gold pieces equal to twice your proficiency bonus on materials.
      At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, these may be collected with a
      successful Hunt and Gather journey activity.</p><p>When taking the Attack
      action, you can forgo one attack to choose a number of allies equal to or
      less than your proficiency bonus that are within 30 feet that can hear and
      see you, and spend an equal amount of exertion. On their next successful
      weapon attack, the chosen allies deal an extra 1d8 damage as they enact
      your recommended strategy. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do
      so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
