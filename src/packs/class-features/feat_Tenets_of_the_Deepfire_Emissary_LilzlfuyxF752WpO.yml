      <p>All Deepfire Emissaries hold similar tenets, regardless of any master
      they serve.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Authenticity. </strong>It is no virtue to see injustice and
      not be angered, to lose a friend and not be saddened, to see a sunset and
      not be moved. Feel your feelings and act upon them responsibly.</li>

      <li><strong>Decisiveness. </strong>Once the proper course of action is
      clear, every moment of delay is a cowardly waste.</li>

      <li><strong>Creativity.</strong> Every warrior should be able to build or
      create as well as destroy.</li>

      <li><strong>Ferocity. </strong>Your foes should fear your wrath and your
      friends should be grateful for your protection.</li>

      </ul>
