      <p>At 18th level, Death itself seems to need your permission to carry out
      its work. Choose one of the following options:</p><h3><strong>Down But Not
      Out</strong></h3><p>If they are not killed outright, friendly creatures
      within range of your Commanding Presence ability automatically stabilize
      when they drop to 0 hit points. This ability only works while you are
      alive.</p><h3><strong>Unbreakable</strong></h3><p>If you would be reduced
      to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you instead drop to 1 hit
      point and may use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against the
      source of the damage that felled you. If this counterattack is a critical
      hit, you immediately heal to half of your maximum hit points. Once you
      have used this ability, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
