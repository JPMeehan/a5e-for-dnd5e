      <p>At 17th level, you learn one of the following&nbsp;grand battle hymns,
      which doesn&rsquo;t count&nbsp;against the number of battle hymns
      you&nbsp;know.</p>

      <p><strong>Beyond the Grave. </strong>When you activate&nbsp;this hymn,
      each ally within 60 feet that is&nbsp;bloodied or unconscious is restored
      to half&nbsp;their hit point maximum. In addition, each&nbsp;target
      recovers from up to 3 levels of&nbsp;fatigue.</p>

      <p><strong>Magic Never Dies. </strong>When you activate&nbsp;this hymn,
      each ally within 30 feet regains&nbsp;up to five levels worth of spell
      slots or&nbsp;gains 30 temporary hit points.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Taste of Victory. </strong>When you activate this hymn, each
      ally within 30 feet of you gains a blessing of victory that lasts for 24
      hours or until it is expended. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or
      contested ability&nbsp;check, they can expend their blessing
      of&nbsp;victory to gain advantage on the roll.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Once you have activated your grand battle hymn, you can&rsquo;t do so
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>
