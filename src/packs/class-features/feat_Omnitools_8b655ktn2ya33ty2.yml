      <p>With a bit of arcane power and a lot of overengineering, your tools
      fold and flip into whatever you need them to be. Also at 4th level, you
      can use your tools of artifice as if they were any kind of artisanâ€™s tools
      or miscellaneous tool kits. This ability does not grant you proficiency in
      those tool sets but you can make tool checks as if you had those
      tools.</p>
