      <p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a
      range of Self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the
      spell’s level (or 1 for a cantrip) to target a second creature in range
      with the same spell.&nbsp;To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of
      targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For
      example,&nbsp;magic missile&nbsp;and&nbsp;scorching ray&nbsp;are
      ineligible, but&nbsp;ray of frost&nbsp;can be modified by Twinned
      Spell.</p>
