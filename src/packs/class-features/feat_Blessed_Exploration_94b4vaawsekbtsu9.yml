      <p>At 6th level, your faith grants you boons suitable for an underground
      denizen. You gain darkvision to a range of 90 feet. Additionally, choose
      one of the following benefits:</p>

      <h2 class="Indent1">Minotaur's Memory</h2>

      <p>You can perfectly recall any route you have traveled.</p>

      <h2 class="Indent1">Shadow Sustenance</h2>

      <p>If you haven&rsquo;t been in an area of sunlight for 24 hours, your
      body begins to fade and you no longer need to eat. This benefit ends when
      you enter an area of sunlight.</p>
