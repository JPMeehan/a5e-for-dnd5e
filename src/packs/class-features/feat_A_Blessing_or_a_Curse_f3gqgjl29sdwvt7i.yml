      <p>At 5th level, you gain the ability to manipulate the strands of fortune
      and fate. You may do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,

      <h3>Witch&rsquo;s Blessing</h3>

      <p>When a creature you can see fails an ability check, attack roll, or
      saving throw, you may use your reaction to apply a bonus equal to 1d4 +
      your spellcasting ability modifier, potentially changing the result of the
      roll.</p>

      <h3>Witch&rsquo;s Curse</h3>

      <p>When a creature you can see succeeds on an ability check, attack roll,
      or saving throws, you may use your reaction to apply a penalty equal to
      1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
