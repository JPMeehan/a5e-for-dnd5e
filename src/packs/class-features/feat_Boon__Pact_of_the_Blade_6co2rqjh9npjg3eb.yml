      <p>You can use your action to conjure in your empty hand an armament
      bestowed with power: a pact weapon. Choose any simple or martial weapon
      when you conjure your pact weapon. You are proficient with it while you
      wield your pact weapon, and you can use your spellcasting ability for
      attack and damage rolls with it. This weapon counts as magical for the
      purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
      damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from
      you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature
      again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you
      die.</p><p>By performing a 1 hour ritual while holding a magic weapon or
      rare weapon, you can transform it into your pact weapon. If this weapon
      has a bonus to attack or damage rolls, or if it deals bonus damage, you
      can apply these to your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.ulmcmf3ofmpzmgzf]{Eldritch
      Blast} (ranged weapons add these bonuses to
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.845tsci8556w0o6x]{Eldritch
      Ray}, and melee weapons to
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.5miit65bic46eynl]{Eldritch
      Scythe}; it has no effect on
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.gd79c49oej8xagdv]{Eldritch
      Disturbance} or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.e7zwh5ljkuffrm7k]{Eldritch
      Whip}). You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
      extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact
      weapon thereafter. You can&rsquo;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon
      in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact&nbsp;weapon if you die, if
      you perform the ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1 hour
      ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon is collected by your patron if
      the bond breaks while it is in the extradimensional space.</p>
