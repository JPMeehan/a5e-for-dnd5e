      empty hand an armament bestowed with power: a pact weapon. Choose any
      simple or martial weapon when you conjure your pact weapon. You are
      proficient with it while you wield your pact weapon, and you can use your
      spellcasting ability for attack and damage rolls with it. This weapon
      counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
      nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more
      than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you
      use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or
      if you die.</span></p>

      class="fontstyle2"><span class="fontstyle2">By performing a 1 hour ritual
      while holding a magic weapon or rare weapon, you can transform it into
      your pact weapon. If this weapon has a bonus to attack or damage rolls, or
      if it deals bonus damage, you can apply these to your Eldritch Blast
      (ranged weapons add these bonuses to Eldritch Ray, and melee weapons to
      Eldritch Scythe; it has no effect on Eldritch Disturbance or Eldritch
      Whip). You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
      extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact
      weapon thereafter. You can&rsquo;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon
      in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact</span>&nbsp;<span
      class="fontstyle0">weapon if you die, if you perform the ritual on a
      different weapon, or if you use a 1 hour ritual to break your bond to it.
      The weapon is collected by your patron if the bond breaks while it is in
      the extradimensional space.</span></span></span></span></p>
