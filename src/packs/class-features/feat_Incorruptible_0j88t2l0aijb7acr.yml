      <p>You become especially hard to manipulate, even by magical means. You
      are immune to the <em>charmed </em>and <em>confused </em>conditions, you
      have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming <em>frightened</em>, and
      spells or effects that would compel you to take specific actions (such as
      <em>command</em> or <em>dominate person</em>) automatically fail.</p>
