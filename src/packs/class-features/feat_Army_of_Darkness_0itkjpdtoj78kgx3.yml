      <p>At 10th level you gain the ability to maintain a number of undead
      minions created using your Create Minion ability. You can maintain a
      number of minions with a total CR equal to or less than your wizard level,
      although no individual minion may have a CR equal to or greater than half
      your wizard level.</p><p>For example, at 10th level you would be able to
      maintain two CR 4 <strong>banshees</strong> and a CR 2
      <strong>ghast</strong>; or you could maintain three CR 3
      <strong>mummies</strong> and a CR 1 <strong>ghoul</strong>.</p>
