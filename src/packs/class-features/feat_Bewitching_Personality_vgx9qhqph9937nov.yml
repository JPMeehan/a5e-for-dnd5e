      <p>At 11th level you have learned how to magically enhance your
      interactions with others, as well as leveraging your natural interpersonal
      skills to enhance your magic. Choose one of the
      following:</p><h3>Fascinating Allure</h3><p>You gain an expertise die on
      Persuasion checks, and may always choose to use your spellcasting ability
      modifier on Persuasion checks, in addition when a creature succeeds on a
      saving throw against a spell you cast that would charm them, you may make
      a Persuasion check opposed by their saving throw. On a success, they must
      reroll their save and take the second result. If the spell targets more
      than one creature, you may only force one of them to
      re-roll.</p><h3>Unnerving Intimidation</h3><p>You gain an expertise die on
      Intimidation checks and may always use your spellcasting ability modifier
      on Intimidation checks. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against
      a spell you cast that would cause them to become frightened or rattled,
      you may make an Intimidation check opposed by their saving throw. On a
      success, they must reroll their save and take the second result. If the
      spell targets more than one creature, you may only force one of them to
      re-roll.</p><h3>Bewildering Deception</h3><p>You gain an expertise die on
      Deception checks and may always apply your spellcasting ability modifier
      to Deception checks. In addition, any time you cast an illusion spell that
      can be seen through with an Investigation check, you may make a Deception
      check and use either your spell save DC or the result of the check as the
      DC to see through the illusion.</p>
