      <p>Your faith has a martial aspect and you can bless the weapons of the
      faithful. When you finish a long rest, you can touch a weapon and bless
      it. Until the start of your next long rest, the first time the weapon
      blessed this way would break, it does not break and loses the blessing
      instead. If the wielder of the weapon has an exertion pool and it is
      empty, they can also dismiss the blessing as a bonus action to recover 1
      point of exertion.</p>
