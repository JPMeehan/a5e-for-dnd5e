      <p>Two minds are often better than one and your bonded artifact can remain
      alert while you rest. Starting at 10th level, so long as your bonded
      artifact is in your possession and not in conflict, you gain a bonus to
      your Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma checks and saving throws equal to
      your bonded artifact&rsquo;s corresponding modifiers. In addition, you are
      considered aware and conscious even when unconscious and you gain
      advantage on initiative checks.</p>
