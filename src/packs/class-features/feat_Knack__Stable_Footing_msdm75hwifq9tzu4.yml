      <p>A steady stance and careful footwork is instinctive to you. You have
      advantage on any check or saving throw to avoid falling prone or handle
      difficult ground (such as against a&nbsp;grease&nbsp;spell or slippery
      ice). You are never prone after taking fall damage, and when calculating
      fall damage you treat the fall distance as if it were shorter by a number
      of feet equal to your proficiency bonus &times; 10.&nbsp;</p>
