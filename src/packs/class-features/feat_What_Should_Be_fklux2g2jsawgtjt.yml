      <p>Also at 1st level, your magic becomes more effective against that which
      should not exist. Once per turn, you may have a damaging spell deal an
      additional 1d6 force damage to all aberrations and undead damaged by the
      spell. This damage increases to 1d8 at level 5, 1d10 at level 11, and 1d12
      at level 17.</p>
