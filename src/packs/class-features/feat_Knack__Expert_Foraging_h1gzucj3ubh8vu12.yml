      <p>Once between long rests, you can take 1 minute to collect a number of
      edible, non-poisonous plants and grubs equal to your proficiency bonus. A
      creature can use its action to eat up to 5 plants or grubs, each of which
      restores 1 hit point and constitutes 1 Supply. The grubs die and spoil 1
      hour after being collected.</p>
