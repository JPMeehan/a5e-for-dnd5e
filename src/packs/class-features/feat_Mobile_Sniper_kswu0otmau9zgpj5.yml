      <p>Also at level 15, you have distilled the old sniper’s wisdom of “shoot,
      then relocate” into a specialized magical technique. As an action, you may
      make a single ranged weapon attack and cast a spell of the Movement
      school, provided you have one available and sufficient spell slots to cast
      it.</p>
