      <p>You gain proficiency in the Insight skill, and gain an expertise die on
      to Insight checks. Whenever a creature is lying to you, it makes a
      Charisma saving throw against a DC equal to your passive Insight score.
      This save is made with disadvantage and done in secret by the Narrator. On
      a failure, you get a strong sense that they are being untruthful.</p>
