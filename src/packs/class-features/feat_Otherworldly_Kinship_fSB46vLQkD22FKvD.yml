      <p>Choose one of the following creature types: aberrations, celestials,
      elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. You can always choose to use Charisma
      on Insight checks against creatures of the chosen type, and you can always
      understand what they say or choose to make yourself understood by them,
      even if you do not otherwise share a language. In addition, you may spend
      1 sorcery point to gain these benefits against another one of the listed
      creature types for 1 hour.</p>
