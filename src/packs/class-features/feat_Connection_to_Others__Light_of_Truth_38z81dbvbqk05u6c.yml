      <p dir="ltr">At 3rd level, your chosen focus on light or dark becomes more
      powerful.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Light of Truth</h3><p dir="ltr">If you choose
      Path of the Light, you now emit bright light to a range of 30 feet and dim
      light to a range of 60 feet. You may suppress this light at will (no
      action required) and reactivate it as a bonus action. While this light is
      active, you have advantage on Insight checks against creatures within the
      area of bright light. In addition, creatures observing illusions within
      the area of the bright light have advantage on saves to disbelieve
      them.</p>
