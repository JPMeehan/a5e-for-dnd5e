      <p>At 20th level, you become an avatar of mercy and forgiveness. You gain
      the following benefits:</p>

      <p><em><strong>Eyes of Mercy.</strong></em> Your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.my42mip0qc35rcp2]{Lay
      on Hands} feature can now be used at a range of 30 feet as long as you can
      see the recipient. In addition, you can spend a minute studying a creature
      and learn the worst thing that has ever been done to it, and what, if
      anything, could help it move on.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Voice of Redemption.</em> </strong>You can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.hnvt4tnuww6o4vvi]{Calm
      Emotions} at will without seen components and without expending spell
      slots.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Hands of Compassion.</strong></em> Any time you touch a
      creature, it is subjected to a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.sgiwn0n20mnf1ddx]{Lesser
      Restoration} effect. You cannot suppress this effect, but it does work on
      you. At the start of your turn it automatically affects any creature
      grappling or grappled by you. Otherwise, to use it in combat requires a
      bonus action.</p>
