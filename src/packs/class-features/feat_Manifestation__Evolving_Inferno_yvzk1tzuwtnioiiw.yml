  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals fire damage,
      you can spend 1 sorcery point to store some of the energy of the spell as
      a flame you hold in one hand. You can use an action to throw this flame,
      making a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 30 feet.
      On a hit, the creature takes [[/r 1d8 #fire]] fire damage per level of the
      spell cast to trigger this effect. The flame lasts for up to 1 minute or
      until it is&nbsp;thrown.</p>
