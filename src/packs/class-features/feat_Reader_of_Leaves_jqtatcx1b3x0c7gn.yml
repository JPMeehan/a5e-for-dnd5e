      <p>Starting at 11th level, after a long rest during which you are able to
      consume and read the dregs of a warm drink, you roll a d20 and use a bonus
      action to choose a creature you can see within 30 feet, including
      yourself. The next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that the
      creature makes, it uses the result instead of rolling a d20. Once you have
      used this feature after a long rest each additional use requires 3
      exertion (and an additional d20 roll), and after using this feature a
      number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you cannot use it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, you may take 10 minutes
      to prepare and consume a soothing drink, after which you can spend 3
      exertion to cast
