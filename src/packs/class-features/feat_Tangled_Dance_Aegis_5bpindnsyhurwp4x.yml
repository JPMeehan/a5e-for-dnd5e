    value: >-
      <p>When you would be hit with an attack and a creature other than the
      attacker is adjacent to you, you can use your reaction to try to dodge so
      the attack hits that creature. If the attacker fails an Intelligence
      saving throw, change the attack&rsquo;s target to another creature within
      5 feet, and the attacker uses the same result of its attack roll.</p>
