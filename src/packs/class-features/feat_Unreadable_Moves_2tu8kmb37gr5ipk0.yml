      <p>Also at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make a Deception check
      opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see that isn&rsquo;t
      incapacitated. On a success, for the next minute you can use
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.4727pnvz5nwn3h23]{Sneak
      Attack} against the creature even if you don&rsquo;t have advantage,
      though not if you have disadvantage. This effect ends early if you use
      Unreadable Moves against a different creature.</p>
