  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, your rage exudes such an intense feeling of
      determination that it fills nearby foes with dread. This aura extends 10
      feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. While
      raging you can use a bonus action to choose one creature you can see in
      your aura and focus your will on it. If the creature can see or hear you,
      it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of
      your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to
      extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the
      end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out
      of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p><p>A creature that
      successfully resists your Terrifying Inevitability is immune to its
      effects for 24 hours.</p>
