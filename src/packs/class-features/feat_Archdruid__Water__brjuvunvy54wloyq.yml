      <p>You can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no
      matter your form. Once each turn, you can use a bonus action to choose a
      target point within 30 feet and one of the following element options. If
      the element you choose is not present at or near the target point, any
      damage dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your
      spell attack, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to
      resist it.</p><p><strong>Water. </strong>You create a 20-foot tall,
      20-foot wide wave that travels 30 feet in one direction and then crashes
      down. Any Large or smaller creatures and objects in the waveâ€™s path make a
      Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature
      takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is carried with the wave. Any creature
      that succeeds on its saving throw takes no damage and is not moved.</p>
