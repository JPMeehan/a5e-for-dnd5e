      <p>When you first gain this feature, select three spells from the
      <em>air</em>, <em>beasts</em>, <em>earth</em>, <em>healing</em>,
      <em>nature</em>, <em>plants</em>, <em>terrain</em>, <em>water</em>, or
      <em>weather </em>schools as your traditional spells. You can select up to
      two additional traditional spells from those schools when you reach 7th,
      9th, and 11th level in this class. You always have your traditional spells
      prepared, and they don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can
      prepare each day. If you select a spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the
      druid spell list, the spell is a druid spell for you.</p>
