      <p>At 18th level, your ability to pour forth energy increases
      substantially. You can cast two spells simultaneously, spending spell
      slots for each, so long as both spells have a casting time of 1 action,
      the sum of their levels is less than 6th-level, and neither spell requires
      concentration. When you do so, make a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the
      sum of the spellsâ€™ levels). On a failure, you waste your action (but not
      any spell slots) and both spells are removed from your spell list until
      you finish a long rest. </p>
