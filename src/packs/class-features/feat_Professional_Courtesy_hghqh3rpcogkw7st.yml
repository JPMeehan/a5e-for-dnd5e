      <p>At 10th level, your connection to death means that you are afforded
      certain cosmic privileges. You make death saving throws with advantage,
      and your aging slows to a crawl. Once you have reached full maturity (25
      years old for humans), each 50 years of life you live only counts as a
      single year for the purposes of aging.</p>
