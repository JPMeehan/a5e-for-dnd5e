      <p>Starting at 11th level, when you perform specific acts of physical and
      martial prowess, you attract the attention of powerful otherworldly
      beings&mdash; entities that you can call upon for power. Choose three of
      the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Boon of Death.</strong> The favor of gods of death falls upon
      you whenever you take a life. When you reduce a living creature to 0 hit
      points, you can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and gain a number of
      temporary hit points equal to your martial arts die plus your proficiency
      bonus. In addition, you have advantage on death saving throws for 1
      minute.</p>

      <p><strong>Boon of Hunting.</strong> When you succeed on a Survival check
      to Hunt and Gather, you find yourself under the favor of hunting gods and
      gather twice as much Supply.</p>

      <p><strong>Boon of Love.</strong> When you succeed on a Persuasion check
      against a creature indifferent to you, gods of love show you favor. You
      can spend 3 exertion to make an indifferent creature friendly towards you
      for 1 hour.</p>

      <p><strong>Boon of Speed.</strong> When you move more than your Speed
      during your turn, you find yourself under the favor of speed gods and can
      use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and take the Dodge action.</p>

      <p><strong>Boon of Tactics.</strong> When you make an opportunity attack
      against a creature, gods of battle show you favor. You can spend 2
      exertion to gain advantage on the opportunity attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Boon of War.</strong> When you score a critical hit against a
      creature, you find yourself under the favor of war gods and can use your
      reaction to spend 2 exertion and acquire this boon. Your next successful
      melee weapon attack deals additional damage equal to your martial arts die
      plus your proficiency bonus.</p>
