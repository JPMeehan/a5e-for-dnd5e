      <p>You make formal religious observances and perform ritual timekeeping.
      You can spend 1 hour during a long rest to make these observances, and if
      you do you only need 4 hours of sleep instead of the normal 6. You learn
      the <em>guidance </em>cantrip if you do not already know it, and when you
      grant expertise dice with a spell of 1st-level or higher, the expertise
      die you grant increases by one step.</p>
