      <p>At 15th level the thrill of danger drives you to new heights. While
      bloodied can grant yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the
      start of your next turn. If you do so, all attack rolls against you have
      advantage for the same duration. Also while bloodied your chance to
      critically hit with weapon attacks is 19-20. If you already critically hit
      on better than a natural 20 you instead increase your critical hit range
      by 1 to a maximum of 17-20.</p><p>In addition, if you die all allies
      within 60 feet that see you fall gain inspiration.</p>
