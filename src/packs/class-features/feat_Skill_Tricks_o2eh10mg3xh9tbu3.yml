      <p>Your focused training allows you to use your skills in ways that others
      canâ€™t. At 1st level you gain a skill trick of your choice. Your tricks are
      detailed at the end of the class description. The Tricks Known column of
      the Rogue table shows when you learn more skill tricks. Unless otherwise
      noted, you can gain each trick only once</p>
