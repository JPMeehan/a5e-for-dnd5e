      <p>At 10th level, you can open a creature&rsquo;s senses to the full scope
      of possibilities before it. As an action, you force vivid visions of
      discarded pasts and possible futures into the mind of a creature you can
      see within 60 feet. The target must make a Wisdom&nbsp;saving
      throw</span>&nbsp;against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target
      takes 8d8 psychic damage and is&nbsp;stunned</span>&nbsp;until the end of
      your next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn&rsquo;t
      stunned. Furthermore, a creature that successfully saves against the
      effect finds the wash of possibility insightful,
      gaining&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;on the next&nbsp;<span>ability check&nbsp;or
      saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. Once you have used
      this ability, you must finish a&nbsp;<span>long rest before you can do so
      again.</p>
