      <p>You can use others around you to hide with special effectiveness. You
      have advantage on Deception and Stealth checks to remain unnoticed in
      crowds, and you can use a disguise kit or take the Hide action while in a
      crowd even while observed, forcing those that had eyes on you to make a
      new check to locate you again.</p>
