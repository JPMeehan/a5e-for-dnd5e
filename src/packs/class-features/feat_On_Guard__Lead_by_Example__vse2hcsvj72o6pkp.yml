      <p>When you use your Rallying Surge to allow a creature to regain hit
      points, that creature also gains an expertise die</span>&nbsp;on
      one&nbsp;<span>saving throw it makes in the next minute. The creature
      chooses whether or not to use the expertise die before making the save,
      and the die is wasted if not used before the effect ends.</p>
