      <p>You gain an expertise die on Strength and Constitution saving throws.
      You also gain resistance to your choice of <em>lightning</em>,
      <em>cold</em>, or <em>thunder</em> damage. You can change the damage type
      whenever you finish a long rest. If you would take damage of one of the
      types you are not resistant to, you may spend 2 sorcery points as a
      reaction to also gain resistance to that damage type until the start of
      your next turn.</p>
