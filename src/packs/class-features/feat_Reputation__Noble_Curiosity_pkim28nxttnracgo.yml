      <p>Your reputation and ferocity have sparked the fascination of the
      nobility. A liveried servant is likely to approach you when you enter the
      holdings of such a noble and invite you to take part in their employerâ€™s
      hospitality. This includes lavish feasting, introductions to the rich and
      powerful, and offers of assistance such as mounts, the repair of your
      armor and weapons, and miscellaneous items worth less than 5 gold.</p>
