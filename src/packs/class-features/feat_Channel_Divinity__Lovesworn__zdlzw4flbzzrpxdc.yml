      dir="ltr">At 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity
      options.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Fidelity.</strong> As an action, you grant a creature
      you touch immunity to the charmed condition and spells of the compulsion
      school until the start of your next turn, ending any such effects. Being
      subject to any of the aforementioned effects cannot prevent you from using
      this Channel Divinity option.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Second Self.</strong> When you cast a spell that
      targets a creature or are targeted by such a spell, you may use your
      reaction to also target an additional willing creature within 30 feet of
      you. Either the original or the additional target must be yourself, and
      all creatures targeted by the spell must be willing targets or the Channel
      Divinity fails.</p>
