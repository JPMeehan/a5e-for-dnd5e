      <p>At 10th level, whenever a die roll other than a d20 is used to produce
      some effect you are aware of within 30 feet of you, you may use your
      reaction to set it as a precedent. For the next minute, all future
      instances of the same thing have the exact same result. For example, if
      one of your companions rolled well on a weapon damage or the numerical
      effects of a spell, you can Establish Precedent on that weapon or spell,
      or if you got a roll you like on an expertise die, you can lock in that
      expertise die result (but only for the check you received the initial
      expertise on). You can also Establish Precedent on a hostile creature’s
      spell damage, etc. The Narrator is the final arbiter in edge
      cases.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t do so again until
      you finish a short or long rest.</p>
