      <p>When a creature would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can use your
      reaction to make an unarmed strike against a creature within your reach.
      On a hit, you can spend 1 exertion to roll your martial arts die and gain
      that many temporary hit points. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again
      until you finish a rest.</p>
