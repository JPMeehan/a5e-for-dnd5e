      <p>Also at 3rd level, you&rsquo;ve integrated your ability to please the
      crowd into ways to impress and intimidate your enemies. You treat any
      weapon you wield and any armor you wear as if it had the Flamboyant
      property. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon
