    value: >-
      <p>Friendly creatures within range of your Commanding Presence make their
      saving throws against effects that would cause them to become confused,
      frightened or rattled with advantage. In addition, if a creature so
      affected makes such a saving throw and both dice would have been
      sufficient to make the save, their attacks deal an additional 1d6 points
      of psychic damage to the source of the effect for the next 10 minutes.</p>
