      <p dir="ltr">You have not only learned to accept the powers of the undead,
      but also how to temporarily embrace it, calling on the shadow of death to
      envelop you. You can use a bonus action to become partially incorporeal,
      like a shadow, for 1 minute.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">While in this form you
      receive the following benefits:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p
      dir="ltr" role="presentation">You gain immunity to the following
      conditions: grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and
      restrained.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You gain resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and
      piercing damage from non-magical attacks, and immunity to necrotic
      damage.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">You can pass through occupied spaces, and squeeze
      through gaps as small as 1 inch wide. If you end your turn in the space of
      another creature (or after one minute you are still squeezing through a
      gap too small for your regular form), you are shunted to the nearest
      unoccupied space, taking 1d10 damage.</p></li><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">All other creatures within
      10ft of you cannot regain hit points, rage hit points, or temporary hit
      points via any means.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"
      role="presentation">While in dim light or darkness, attacks against you
      have disadvantage.</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you use this feature,
      you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
