      <p>Beginning at level 6, your skin takes on a lava-like crust while you
      are raging. While you have rage hit points, damage you take is reduced by
      an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus before any resistances or
      immunities you have are applied. This can only apply once per source of
      damage, no matter how many types of damage it does.</p>
