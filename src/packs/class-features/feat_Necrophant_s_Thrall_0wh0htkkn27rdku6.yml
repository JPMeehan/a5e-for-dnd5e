      <p dir="ltr">Starting at 17th level, if a humanoid or beast of large size
      or smaller dies, and it has been dealt necrotic damage by you in the last
      minute, you may use a bonus action to reanimate it as an undead that is
      completely loyal to you. It gains the Skeleton or Zombie template (your
      choice). The undead remains until you use this feature again, it is
      reduced to 0hp, you dismiss it, or a number of days has passed equal to
      your Wisdom modifier.</p><p dir="ltr">If the creature you reanimate has
      spell slots, it does not regain any used spell slots upon being
      reanimated, nor upon completing a short or long rest.</p><p dir="ltr">The
      undead has its own turn, rolling its own initiative. While it is within 60
      feet, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead. You may
      decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next
      turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not
      given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to
      follow a command until its task is complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have
      used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
