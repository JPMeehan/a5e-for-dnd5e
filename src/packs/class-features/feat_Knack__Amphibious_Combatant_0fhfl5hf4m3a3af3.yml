      <p>You gain a swimming speed equal to your Speed, and may spend 1 exertion
      to reroll a failed Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check related to
      aquatic activity (such as Athletics checks to swim, Acrobatics checks to
      keep balance on a ship&rsquo;s deck, or Constitution checks to hold your
      breath). You may choose whether to use the new roll or the original. In
      addition, you add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you can
      hold your breath before suffocating, and can spend 1 exertion to hold your
      breath for an additional minutes equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
