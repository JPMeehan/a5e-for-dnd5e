      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to wield weapons as if they were an extension
      of your body. You gain proficiency in martial weapons, medium armor, and
      shields. Additionally, you can use a melee weapon as an arcane focus, and
      you can use your action to use Elemental Blast as a melee spell attack
      with your weapon.</p>
