      options:</p><ul><li><strong>Unmoored:</strong> You permanently suffer the
      Bewildered mental stress effect.</li><li><strong>Paranoid:</strong> You
      permanently suffer the On Edge mental stress effect.</li><li dir="ltr"

    description: "<p>A bewildered creature is overwhelmed by trying to\_process a particular event. Its mind begins to play\_tricks, altering its perceptions. A bewildered creature\_has disadvantage on social-based ability checks as\_it struggles to engage with whatâ€™s happening. When\_a bewildered creature would succeed on an ability\_check, roll another d20. On a result of 15 or less the\_creature succeeds, but otherwise it fails the ability\_check instead. This could be caused by a temporary\_forgetfulness that leads the creature to forget what\_it was trying to achieve, or in some cases a brief\_hallucination that alters the circumstances in such\_a way that it is unable to succeed.</p>"
