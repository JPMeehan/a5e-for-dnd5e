    value: >-
      <p>If the creature is dying, it continues making death saving throws but
      stops being incapacitated for up to 3 rounds. The creature becomes
      incapacitated if it takes any damage, and it dies if it fails its last
      death saving throw. Once a creature has benefited from this battle hymn,
      it canâ€™t benefit from it again until it finishes a short or long rest.</p>
