      <p>Youâ€™re a reputed leader, a person to be trusted whose words are to be
      heeded. You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. In addition, you
      may spend 1 exertion point as a bonus action to inspire a creature that
      can hear you. The creature makes an Insight check opposed by your
      Persuasion check, becoming inspired by you on a failure. Indifferent
      creatures you inspire in this way become friendly towards you and your
      allies, and friendly creatures you inspire in this way will consider you
      an ally and may provide you with local information that would otherwise
      remain secret. Creatures will remain inspired by you indefinitely unless
      you do something that would make them hostile or lose confidence in you,
      such as lying, stealing, or causing them or their allies harm, or being
      proven cowardly or untrustworthy in any way.</p>
