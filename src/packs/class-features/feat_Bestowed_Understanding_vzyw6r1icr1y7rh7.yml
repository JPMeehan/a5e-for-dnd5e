      <p>When attempting to understand a language with which you are not
      proficient (whether spoken or written), you can make a DC 15 Wisdom
      (Insight) check to understand the basic message. If the language is
      considered forgotten, you roll with disadvantage. You can do so a number
      of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain spent uses upon
      finishing a long rest.</p>
