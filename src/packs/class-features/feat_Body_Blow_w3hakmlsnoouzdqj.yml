    value: >-
      <p>At 17th level when you have a creature of your size or smaller
      grappled, you can use them to attack another creature within your reach
      with an improvised melee weapon attack, dealing basic melee damage to both
      them and the target on hit. You can instead spend an exertion point to
      throw them as a ranged improvised weapon, range 10/20 feet, in which case
      both creatures take basic melee damage if you hit, only the thrown
      creature takes basic melee damage if you miss, and the grapple then ends.
      You can use this to throw a grappled creature up to 20 feet even if you
      don't have a target to attack, dealing basic melee damage to the thrown
      creature as if you had missed.</p>
