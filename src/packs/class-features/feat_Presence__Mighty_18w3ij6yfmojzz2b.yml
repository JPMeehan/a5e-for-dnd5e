      always choose to use Constitution when making Intimidation
      checks.</p><p>In addition, when you enter a tavern or other social
      gathering, you can make a DC 15 Intimidation check while loudly declaring
      that you are looking for something or someone. On a success, most of the
      people there look at and otherwise point out whoever they believe is the
      person you are looking for or the person most likely to know about what
      you are seeking.</p>
