      <p dir="ltr">Beginning at 6th level, whenever a creature with your
      elemental divination dice makes a damage roll, they can expend elemental
      divination dice to deal bonus damage to one of their targets. The target
      takes 1d8 damage per elemental damage die spent in this way, the damage
      type being the same as your Channel Divinity: Elemental Intervention.</p>
