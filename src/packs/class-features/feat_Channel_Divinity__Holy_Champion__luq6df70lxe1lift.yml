      <p>At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
      Channel Divinity options.</p>

      <h2>Negative Energy Flood</h2>

      <p>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to unleash a flood of
      negative energy on your foes. Creatures you choose within 30 feet of you
      make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8
      necrotic damage and is pushed back 5 feet. On a success, it takes half
      damage and isn&rsquo;t pushed back.</p>

      <h2>Positive Energy Flood</h2>

      <p>As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to send out a
      flood of positive energy to heal your allies. Creatures you choose
      (including yourself) within 30 feet regain hit points equal to your
      proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.</p>
