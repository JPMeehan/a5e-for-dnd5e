      <p>While you are conscious, any ally within range of your Commanding
      Presence feature that would make a saving throw can choose to make the
      saving throw with disadvantage. If a success on the saving throw would
      cause the ally to take half the damage, the ally takes no damage on a
      successful save instead.</p>
