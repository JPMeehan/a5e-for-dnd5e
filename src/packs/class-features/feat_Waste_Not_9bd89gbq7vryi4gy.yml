      <p>With 10 minutes work you can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of
      a beast, dragon, monstrosity, or plant that has a CR of 1 or higher and
      has died within the last hour. If sold to a collector, naturalist, or
      other druid, this notable component is worth an amount of gold equal to 5
      &times; the creature&rsquo;s CR.</p>
