      <p>By spending 10 minutes observing facial expressions, body language, and
      vocal intonation, you can detect minute details which give you insight
      into the creatures within 30 feet of you. For the next minute, you can
      direct your focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet. If
      the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak
      any language, the creature is unaffected.</p><p>You learn the surface
      thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an
      action, you can shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts.</p>
