      <p>At 6th level you master a technique passed down through countless
      generations of druids. Choose one of the following:</p><h3><strong>Harvest
      Boon</strong></h3><p>You learn the druidic rituals of vitality that have
      ensured generations of bountiful harvests. You always have the spell
      <strong>Plant Growth </strong>prepared and it doesnâ€™t count against the
      number of spells you can prepare each day. You may also <strong>Plant
      Growth  </strong>without expending a spell slot when casting the spell
      using the Enlarged option.</p>
