      <p>You improve your armor. Its AC increases by +1 and you gain an
      additional ability based on the variety of armor it is.</p>

      <p><strong>Upgraded Light Armor: </strong>Your armor is outfitted with a
      stealth system. As a bonus action, you can cause yourself to fade from
      sight, becoming lightly obscured for one minute. Once you have used this
      ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can&rsquo;t
      do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Upgraded Medium Armor: </strong>Your armor is outfitted with a
      movement enhancement system. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet while
      wearing your armor.</p>

      <p><strong>Upgraded Heavy Armor: </strong>Your armor is equipped with an
      automatic medical system and stabilizers. The armor now automatically ends
      ongoing damage on you after it has triggered once and you have advantage
      on saving throws to avoid being moved against your will or knocked
      prone.</p>
