      <p dir="ltr">When you use your Wild Shape to transform into a creature
      with both a bite attack and a swim speed, you gain an expertise die on
      Stealth and Athletics checks while in the water.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, once per turn, you can deal extra damage when
      you hit a creature with a bite attack. The amount of extra damage is a
      number of d6s equal to half your proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In order to apply this damage, you must not have disadvantage
      on the attack and your target must be within 5 feet of another enemy of
      the target who is not incapacitated. Alternatively, you can apply this
      damage if you have advantage on the attack.</p>
