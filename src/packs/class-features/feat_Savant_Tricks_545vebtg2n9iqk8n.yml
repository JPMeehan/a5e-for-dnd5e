      <p>You have developed a small number of clever gambits, deft maneuvers,
      and canny guards which help you prevail in battle by using your wits. The
      number of tricks you know is listed on the Savant table, and you can
      choose from the list below and from the list of tricks your archetype
      makes available.</p><p>To use a trick, you must first prepare it by
      spending a bonus action. You cannot prepare a trick outside of an
      encounter, but once a trick is prepared, it remains prepared until you use
      it, until the encounter ends, or until you spend a bonus action to replace
      it with a different trick. You can only have one trick prepared at
      time.</p><p>Different tricks can be used at different times. Some require
      your action, bonus action, or reaction. Others might be used when making
      attacks.</p><p>Some of your tricks require your target to make a saving
      throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
      follows:</p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Trick save DC </strong>=
      8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p>Whenever you
      gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace a trick you know
      with a different trick.</p><p></p><h3><strong>TYPES OF
      TRICKS</strong></h3><p>Some tricks are called <strong>Aegises</strong>,
      which let you use your reaction to defend against some sort of attack.
      Other tricks are called <strong>Flourishes</strong>, which you can use
      when you hit with a melee weapon attack .</p><p>If a trick offers a saving
      throw , after you use it against a particular creature, that creature has
      advantage on saving throws against other uses of that same trick until the
      end of combat. If the trick doesnâ€™t permit a saving throw, after you use
      it against a particular creature, you cannot use the same trick against
      that creature for the rest of the combat.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
