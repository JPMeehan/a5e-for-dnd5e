    value: >-
      <p>You have developed a small number of clever gambits, deft maneuvers,
      and canny guards which help you prevail in battle by using your wits. The
      number of tricks you know is listed on the Savant table, and you can
      choose from the list below and from the list of tricks your archetype
      makes available.</p>

      <p>To use a trick, you must first prepare it by spending a bonus action.
      You cannot prepare a trick outside of an encounter, but once a trick is
      prepared, it remains prepared until you use it, until the encounter ends,
      or until you spend a bonus action to replace it with a different trick.
      You can only have one trick prepared at time.</p>

      <p>Different tricks can be used at different times. Some require your
      action, bonus action, or reaction. Others might be used when making
      attacks.</p>

      <p>Some of your tricks require your target to make a saving throw to
      resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Trick save DC </strong>= 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

      <p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace a
      trick you know with a different trick.</p>

      <h2>Types of Tricks</h2>

      <p>Some tricks are called <strong>Aegises</strong>, which let you use your
      reaction to defend against some sort of attack. Other tricks are called
      <strong>Flourishes</strong>, which you can use when you hit with a melee
      weapon attack.</p>

      <p>If a trick offers a saving throw , after you use it against a
      particular creature, that creature has advantage on saving throws against
      other uses of that same trick until the end of combat. If the trick
      doesn&rsquo;t permit a saving throw, after you use it against a particular
      creature, you cannot use the same trick against that creature for the rest
      of the combat.</p>
