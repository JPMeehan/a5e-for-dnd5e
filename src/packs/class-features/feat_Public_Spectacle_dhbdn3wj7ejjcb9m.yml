      <p>At 6th level, whenever you kill a creature with Headsmanâ€™s Cut, you may
      snatch up its head and hold it aloft as part of the attack, causing
      hostile creatures within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw.
      Creatures that fail their saving throw take 2d6 psychic damage and are
      frightened of you for one minute. Creatures that succeed take half as much
      damage and are rattled until the beginning of your next turn. A frightened
      creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the
      frightened condition on a success. Once a creature has successfully saved
      against this feature, it has advantage on future saves against it for the
      rest of combat, and future successes avoid the damage entirely rather than
      halving it.</p>
