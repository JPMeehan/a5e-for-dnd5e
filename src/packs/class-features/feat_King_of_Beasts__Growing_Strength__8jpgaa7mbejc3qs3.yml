      <p>At 14th level your power grows by leaps and bounds. You gain one of the
      following abilities based on your choice of flesh and bone.</p>

      <p><strong>King of Beasts</strong>: As an action you can throw your head
      back to unleash a terrifying roar that is audible up to 300ft away. All
      creatures within the area must make a Wisdom save against your spell save
      DC or become frightened for up to 1 minute. Affected creatures may make a
      Wisdom save at the end of each of their turns to end the effect, and any
      creature that has been affected by this ability becomes immune for 24
      hours once they make a successful save. You may use this ability once per
      short rest, or spend a sorcery point as a bonus action to regain use of
      it.<br>In addition, your bite attack now deals 2d8 acid damage on a
      successful hit.</p>
