      <p class="preFade fadeIn">When you choose this archetype at level 2, you
      gain the benefits of a persistent arcane shield. This magical protective
      aura grants you a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. The arcane shield only
      operates while you are awake and conscious.</p>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn">At level 10, the AC bonus increases to +2, and
      at level 14 it increases to +3.</p>
