      3rd level you gain a reputation for a unique way to use magic in battle,
      your dramatic flair off the field, and your mystical talents. Choose one
      from the following options:</span></p>

      <p>Choose one from the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Flamboyance</strong>: <em>Your flair for the dramatic grants
      you temporary benefits.</em> Performing a trickshot, with a DC 13 attack
      roll, grants you expertise on your next Deception or Persuasion skill
      check.<br><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">You may instead attempt a DC 17
      trick shot to instead gain advantage.<br>You may only gain advantage once
      during the encounter.</span></li>

      <li><strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Quiet Observer</strong><span
      style="font-size: 10.5pt;">: <em>An uncomfortable silence and a piercing
      gaze can cut through difficult matters with ease.<br></em></span><span
      style="font-size: 10.5pt;">So long as you remain silent and do not attempt
      to use sign language to communicate during an encounter, you gain
      expertise on Intimidation and Persuasion checks.</span><strong
      style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><br></strong></li>

      <li><strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Shrewd Accuracy</strong><span
      style="font-size: 10.5pt;">: <em>You&rsquo;re well known for aiming true,
      even with people.</em><br>You gain expertise on Perception checks made on
      a person&rsquo;s appearance, and all Insight checks.</span></li>
