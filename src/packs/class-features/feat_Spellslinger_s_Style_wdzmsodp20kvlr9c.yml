      instead gain advantage.<br>You may only gain advantage once during the
      encounter.</li><li><strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Quiet
      Observer</strong>: <em>An uncomfortable silence and a piercing gaze can
      cut through difficult matters with ease.<br></em>So long as you remain
      silent and do not attempt to use sign language to communicate during an
      encounter, you gain expertise on Intimidation and Persuasion
      checks.<strong style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><br></strong></li><li><strong
      style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Shrewd Accuracy</strong>: <em>You&rsquo;re well
      known for aiming true, even with people.</em><br>You gain expertise on
