      <p>Also at 20th level, the magic you bring to bear can be made to build
      upon itself. When you cast a spell of 4th-level or lower that deals
      damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to half the spellâ€™s
      level (minimum 1) to reroll any dice that have the maximum result and add
      them to the total. For example, if you cast an
      exploding&nbsp;fireball&nbsp;and roll three 6s among your damage dice, you
      roll an additional 3d6, and continue to reroll any 6s adding them to the
      total damage dealt.</p>
