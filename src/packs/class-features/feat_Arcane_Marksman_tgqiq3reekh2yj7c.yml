      <p>At 3rd level when you select this archetype, you gain proficiency with
      the Arcana skill. If you are already proficient, you gain an expertise
      die. You also become proficient with the Biting Zephyr combat tradition
      and learn a Biting Zephyr maneuver you qualify for. It does not count
      against your maneuvers known. If you are already proficient with Biting
      Zephyr, you may choose another combat tradition available to the ranger
      class in its place.</p>
