      <p dir="ltr">At 2nd level, your time spent leading the unfaithful and
      peering into dark voids has granted you boons. You learn one bard
      Adventuring Trick or one warlock Secret of Arcana, using your dirgesinger
      levels to meet level requirements. You learn an additional Arcana Trick at
      your eighth level in dirgesinger.</p><p dir="ltr">Adventuring Tricks that
      use song and music instead use chanting or monologuing with your voice as
      the instrument, but otherwise function as normal.</p>
