      <p>At 1st level, when you are unarmed or wielding only an adept weapon (a
      punching dagger, quarterstaff, shortsword, or any simple melee weapon that
      doesn't have the heavy or two-handed property) and you aren't using a
      shield, you gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength when calculating attack and
      damage rolls with your unarmed strikes and adept weapons.</li>

      <li>Instead of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or adept weapon,
      you can use the die shown in the Martial Arts column of the Adept table,
      which starts as a d4.</li>

      <li>When you use the Attack action to make an unarmed strike or an adept
      weapon attack on your turn, you can use a bonus action to make an unarmed
      strike.</li>

      </ul>
