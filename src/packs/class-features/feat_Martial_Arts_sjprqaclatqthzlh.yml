      <p>At 1st level, your trail to perfection gives you mastery of combat
      styles that use unarmed strikes and adept weapons, which are
      quarterstaffs, punching daggers, shortswords, and any simple melee weapons
      that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p><p>You gain the
      following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only adept weapons
      and you aren’t wielding a shield:</p><ul><li><p>You can use Dexterity
      instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed
      strikes and adept weapons.</p></li><li><p>You can roll a d4 in place of
      the normal damage of your unarmed strike or adept weapon. This die changes
      as you gain adept levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Adept
      table.</p></li><li><p>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed
      strike or an adept weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as
      a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with
      a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action,
      assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</p></li></ul>
