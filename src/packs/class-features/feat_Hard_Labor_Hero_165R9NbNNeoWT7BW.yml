      <p dir="ltr">Your strength of will is respected in many trades. You may
      spend eight hours working with others at a trade where hard work and
      strength of personality are respected, such as logging, mining, or
      wrangling, to gain the ability to call on the other workers for one favor.
      The favor must be within your colleagues&rsquo; ability to perform, and
      they will not work against their own self-interest. Example favors include
      rallying a group to back you up when confronting a powerful individual,
      helping to construct (or deconstruct) a structure, spreading the news of
      your heroism around the community, or providing you with a critical piece
      of information about local affairs.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">If you do not call in this favor within a month, the goodwill
      dissipates. If you work for a week, the favor can be called in within six
      months; if you work for a month, the favor can be called in any time in
      the next year.</p>
