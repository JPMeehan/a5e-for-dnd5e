      <p>At 17th level you stop naturally aging, are immune to magical aging,
      and have no maximum lifespan. You also ignore the first level of fatigue
      you gain per day, and when critically hit by an attack you may spend 2
      exertion points as a reaction to reduce the damage to a normal hit, though
      other additional effects of the critical hit still apply.</p>
