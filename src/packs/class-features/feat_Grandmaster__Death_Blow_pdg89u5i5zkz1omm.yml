      <p>You learn how to strike with incredible force at your target’s very
      life force. When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to
      make your attack a critical hit that deals maximum damage. In addition, if
      the target is a creature it makes a Constitution saving throw or it is
      reduced to 0 hit points. You can’t use this feature again until you finish
      a short or long rest.</p>
