      <p>Beginning at 17th level, you can focus your mind to identify any
      enemy&rsquo;s weaknesses. Once per rest, you can use a bonus action to
      choose one creature you can see within 60 feet and expose a flaw in its
      defenses. Until the end of your next turn, any creature that can hear or
      see you has advantage on attack rolls made against that creature, and
      their attacks and spells deal an extra 6 damage to it.</p>
