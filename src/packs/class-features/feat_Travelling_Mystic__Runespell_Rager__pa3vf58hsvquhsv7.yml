      <p dir="ltr">At 3rd level, the unique companions that you have met, as
      well as strange insights gained from your blended studies, taught you
      unintended lessons. Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Invocation of the
      Courts:</strong>&nbsp;Your study into other realms has let you steal some
      of their secrets. You learn one invocation from the Invocation of the
      Courts warlock feature for which you meet the prerequisites. You may use
      runespell rager levels in place of warlock levels to meet these
      prerequisites.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p
      dir="ltr"><strong>Prescient Communication:</strong>&nbsp;Whispers of the
      spirits you commune with help you determine the most effective way to
      speak with another creature. Before attempting to persuade, deceive, or
      intimidate a creature, you may get a &ldquo;good&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;bad&rdquo; feeling about the results of your efforts if you do
      succeed as if you had cast the augury spell. You may decide on a different
      course of action if you don&rsquo;t trust how you feel. You may use this
      feature once per short rest.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p
      dir="ltr"><strong>Warrior Born:</strong>&nbsp;You may choose one of the
      options granted by the Warrior Born berserker feature.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>
