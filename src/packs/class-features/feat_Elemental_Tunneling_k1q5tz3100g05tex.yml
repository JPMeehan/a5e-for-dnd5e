      <p dir="ltr">As an action, you can create a passage through an element in
      which you have elemental affinity. You can create a 15-ft-wide,
      15-foot-tall, 50-ft long tunnel through elemental material, following
      along with you as you move. The tunnel collapses and the elemental
      material returns to its previous state at the end of your turn if you do
      not use an action to maintain it each round. You can tunnel through
      storms, snow, soil and rock, wildfires, or even lava; the tunnel keeps all
      harmful effects from the material (such as heat, wind, or pressure) from
      affecting those inside while the tunnel is maintained.</p>
