      <p>At 11th level, with a mix of planning and motivation you can help
      someone maximize their efforts at one type of task. Spend an action and
      choose a creature within 30 feet that can understand you, and choose one
      ability score. For the next hour, that creature gains the benefits of<em>
      </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.wanifj91e9h6vbpo]{Enhance
      Ability}<em> </em>for the chosen ability score. This is not a magical
      effect, and you do not need to concentrate to maintain it.</p><p>Once you
      use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use
      it again.</p>
