      <p>When a creature within 30 feet that can sense you makes an attack that
      isn&rsquo;t targeting you, you can use your reaction to try to distract
      the attacker. If it fails a Wisdom saving throw, until your next turn it
      has disadvantage on all attack rolls it makes that aren&rsquo;t against
      you.</p>
