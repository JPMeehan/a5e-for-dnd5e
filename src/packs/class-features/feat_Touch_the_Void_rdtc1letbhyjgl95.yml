      <p>At 18th level, you can spend 1 hour in meditation to cast <em>astral
      projection</em>, <em>dream</em>, or <em>etherealness</em>. Each of these
      spells is slightly different when cast using this feature, as described
      below:</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Astral Projection.</em></strong> The
      spell requires no material components, but only affects
      you.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dream.</em></strong> You are the
      messenger in the dream, and while you are influencing the dream you are
      completely detached from your body.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <em>Etherealness</em></strong><em>.</em> When the spell ends, you reappear
      in the space you were in when you originally cast the spell.</p><p>After
      using this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
