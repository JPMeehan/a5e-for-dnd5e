    value: >-
      <p>While wielding a weapon which benefits from one with the spear and
      using no other weapons you may make off-hand attacks with the haft or
      pommel of your weapon. Doing so follows all the normal rules of
      dual-wielding, but allows you to apply any magical bonuses from the weapon
      to your haft strike.&nbsp;</p><p>This damage begins at 1d4, but increases
      as you gain levels in the Lancer motif, growing to 1d6 at level 4 and 1d8
      at level 8.</p><p>The damage of your haft strike is bludgeoning.</p>
