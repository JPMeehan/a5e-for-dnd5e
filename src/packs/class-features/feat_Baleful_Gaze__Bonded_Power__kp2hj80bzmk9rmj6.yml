      <p>Also at 1st level you gain a special ability tied to the experiments
      that were pressed upon you. Your bonded power must be of the same line as
      your flesh and bone selection.</p>

      <p><strong>Baleful Gaze</strong>: As an action you may attempt to stun all
      creatures in a 15ft cone. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution
      save against your spell DC. On a failure they are stunned until the
      beginning of their next turn. You may use this ability once per short
      rest, or expend a sorcery point as a bonus action to recover use of
      it.</p>
