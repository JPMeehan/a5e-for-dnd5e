      <p>At 15th level, if you can get to them in time, there’s virtually nobody
      you can’t save. You learn the <em>spare the dying</em> cantrip.
      Additionally, once per long rest, you may cast <em>revivify</em> without
      material components. If you have already used this feature, you may use it
      again a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, but you
      require one use of a healer’s kit to do so (it is consumed in the
      process).</p>
