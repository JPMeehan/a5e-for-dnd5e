      <p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power
      that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
      restore a total number of hit points equal to your herald level Ã—
      5.</p><p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the
      pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum
      amount remaining in your pool.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit
      points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or
      neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and
      neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending
      hit points separately for each one.</p><p>This feature has no effect on
      undead and constructs.</p>
