      <p>You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are
      hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from
      the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your adept
      level.</p><p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if
      it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one
      hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 exertion to
      make a ranged weapon attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you
      just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with
      proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile
      counts as an adept weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20
      feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>
