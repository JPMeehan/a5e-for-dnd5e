      dir="ltr">At 7th level, you understand that the foundation of love is
      mutual trust. You may cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.4rgo85d49qwancup]{Detect
      Thoughts} without a spell slot. However, when you cast this spell in this
      way, your target is also able to read your surface thoughts on an initial
      failed save. Likewise, if you choose to probe deeper into the
      target&rsquo;s mind and the target fails its saving throw, the target is
      also able to probe deeper into your mind. If you choose, you may allow a
      willing target to read your surface thoughts or to probe deeper into your
      mind without (or before) doing so to them.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Once a creature succeeds on a saving throw against this
      ability, it cannot be targeted again for 24 hours unless it is
      willing.</p>
