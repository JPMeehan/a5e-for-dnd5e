      <p>As an action you may become a living shadow for 1 minute. As long as
      you are in dim light or darkness you have resistance to all damage except
      force and radiant, can take the hide action as a bonus action even without
      cover, and can move through solid objects as difficult terrain. If you end
      your turn in a solid object you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied
      space and take 1d10 force damage. Once you have used this ability you
      cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
