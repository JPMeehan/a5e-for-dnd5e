      <p>Also at 3rd level, when you have disadvantage on ability checks or
      saving throws, you gain an expertise die. When you have disadvantage on an
      attack roll, you add your proficiency bonus to damage. Whenever you have
      disadvantage on any die roll, you can spend 2 exertion to roll normally
      instead. Starting at 11th level you can instead spend 4 exertion to turn
      the disadvantage into advantage.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you roll
      with advantage or disadvantage and roll the same result on both die, you
      become emboldened. Until the end of your next turn, your next weapon
      attack deals an additional damage die.</p>
