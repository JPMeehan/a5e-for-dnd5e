      <p>You cause a creature that was reduced to 0 hit points to roll a number
      of hit dice equal to its proficiency bonus (without losing or expending
      them), gain the total as hit points, and remain standing. If the creature
      has a reaction, it may move up to half its movement speed without
      provoking attacks of opportunity as a reaction. The creature then has its
      death saves set to 2 failures until the end of its next long rest and
      becomes Doomed if it is reduced to 0 hit points before then.</p>
