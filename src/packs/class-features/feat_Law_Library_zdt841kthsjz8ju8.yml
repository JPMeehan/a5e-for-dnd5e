      <p>At 6th level, you gain access to a magical library of laws and rules.
      This can be used in two different ways:</p><h3><strong>Library
      Access</strong></h3><p>When you start a short rest, you can choose a topic
      to study from the library, browsing through its spectral volumes. You have
      disadvantage on all Perception checks while studying from the library.
      When you finish your long rest, you may make a single Arcana, Culture,
      Engineering, History, or Nature check with advantage. If you succeed on
      your check, the next attack you make against a creature of the
      corresponding type (see below) is made with
      advantage.</p><h3><strong>Local Primer</strong></h3><p>When you are in the
      bounds of a settlement, as an action, you can summon a spectral law book
      containing all the rules of behavior for that place, written and
      unwritten, and the local power structure. The book is obviously magical
      and clearly not a solid object, cannot be damaged or taken from you, and
      persists until you dismiss it (no action required) or leave the bounds of
      the settlement. The book sheds bright light to a range of 5 feet and dim
      light to a range of 15 feet.</p><p>The amount of time it takes to read
      this book for a given community is up to the Narrator, but as an action,
      you can learn any of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Who is officially in
      charge of the area.</p></li><li><p>A brief summary of what sorts of
      behavior will win you favor or get you into trouble.</p></li><li><p>What
      deviations from common legal norms exist, if any. For example: if theft is
      legal here or wearing green clothing is not.</p></li><li><p>What rights
      you have in the settlement, if any.</p></li></ul><p>You may use this
      feature at will.</p>
