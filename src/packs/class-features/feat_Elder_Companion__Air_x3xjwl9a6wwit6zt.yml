      dir="ltr">As you grow in power, so does your elemental companion.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 11th level, your elemental companion grows to large size,
      though you can reduce it to medium or small or back again to large as an
      action. It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to
      d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are
      able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its
      Elder ability, shown below.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Air, Whirlwind:</strong> Your elemental companion
      takes the form of a whirlwind, flies up to half its speed without
      provoking opportunity attacks, and then resumes its normal form. When a
      creature shares its space with the whirlwind for the first time during its
      turn, that creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell
      save DC. On a failure, the creature is carried inside the
      elemental&rsquo;s space until the whirlwind ends, taking your air blast
      damage, and falls prone at the end of the movement. The whirlwind can
      carry one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>
