      <p>Also at 3rd level, you obtain a magical signature weaponâ€”your Weapon of
      Dread. Select one weapon with the Versatile or Two-Handed property. You
      acquire a masterwork weapon of that type that you can conjure into your
      empty hand as an action. It is always considered to have the flamboyant
      property. This is a magical weapon (it overcomes resistance and immunity
      to nonmagical attacks and damage). Your Weapon of Dread disappears if it
      is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears
      if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action
      required), or if you die.</p>
