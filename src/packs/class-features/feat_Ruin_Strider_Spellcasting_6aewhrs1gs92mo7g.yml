      <h2>Cantrips</h2><p>At 3rd level, you know two cantrips of your choice
      from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional cantrip at 10th
      level.</p><h2>Spells Known of 1st-Level or Higher</h2><p>You know two
      1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The spells
      count as ranger spells for you.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Ruin
      Strider table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice.
      Each of these spells must be of a level that you are able to cast. For
      instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new
      spell of 1st or 2nd-level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in
      this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace
      it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a
      level of which you can cast.</p><h2>Spell Points</h2><p>The Ruin Strider
      Spellcasting table shows how many spell points you have to cast your
      spells of 1st level and higher.</p><p>To cast one of your Ruin Strider
      spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of spell points
      dependent on the spell&rsquo;s level.</p><p>You can also cast a spell you
      know at a higher spell level by spending the appropriate number of spell
      points. The maximum spell level you can cast is shown in the Spell Level
      column of the Ruin Strider table. You regain all expended spell points
      when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Ruin Strider
      Spells</h2><p>You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels
      in this class, as shown in the Ruin Strider Spells table. The spell counts
      as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of
      ranger spells you know.</p><table style="width: 100%;"

      in which you have obtained your powers is defined by the means used to
      uncover those secrets: through deduction, intuition or willpower. Choose
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma to be your spellcasting ability. Once
      you make this choice, you cannot change it. You use the chosen ability
      whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
      that ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell
      you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save
      DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability
      modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency
      bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p>
