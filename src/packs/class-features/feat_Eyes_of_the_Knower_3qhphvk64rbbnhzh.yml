      <p>Also at 3rd level, you are continually under the effect of the
      comprehend languages spell. This is a magical effect and can be suppressed
      if you are in an antimagic field or similar effect, but it reactivates
      with no action required on your part as soon as you are outside the area
      of the suppressing effect.</p><p>In addition all spells from the knowledge
      school are added to the bard list for you, and you may select from them
      when learning a new bard spell.</p>
