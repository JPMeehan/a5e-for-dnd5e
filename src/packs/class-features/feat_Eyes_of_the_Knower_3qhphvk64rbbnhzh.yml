      <p>Also at 3rd level, you are continually under the effect of the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.my7wwb844zvxcv4o]{Comprehend
      Languages} spell. This is a magical effect and can be suppressed if you
      are in an antimagic field or similar effect, but it reactivates with no
      action required on your part as soon as you are outside the area of the
      suppressing effect.</p>

      <p>In addition all spells from the <em>knowledge </em>school are added to
      the bard list for you, and you may select from them when learning a new
      bard spell.</p>
