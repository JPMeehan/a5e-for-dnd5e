      <p>When you witness a grave injustice or atrocity yourself, you can
      condemn the perpetrator as a bonus action. To do so, you must be within
      100 feet of the creature you deem most responsible for the wicked deed.
      Alternatively, you may choose a single creature you have a warrant for.
      Used this way, the creature saves with advantage, but the range is
      unlimited. </p><p>A creature so condemned must make a Charisma saving
      throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails its save can no
      longer hide from you. For the next week, its outline seems to glow even
      behind solid barriers or if it becomes invisible or enters the ethereal
      plane. If the creature is far enough from you that you could not see it, a
      glow on the horizon indicates its general direction to you. These effects
      are only visible to you, not your companions. In addition, the damage dice
      of your Divine Smite ability become D10s against the creature and you have
      advantage on saving throws imposed by any of its spells or effects. This
      effect ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or you use this
      Channel Divinity option again.</p><p>A creature that succeeds on its save
      instead has disadvantage on all checks to hide from you or put you off its
      trail for 24 hours.</p>
