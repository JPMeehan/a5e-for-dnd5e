      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to track down those who would evade justice.
      You gain proficiency with the Survival skill, and you gain the Tracking
      skill specialty for it. In addition, you are able to use the tools of
      capture better than most. The DC to escape nets you throw, manacles you
      attach, and ropes you tie becomes your maneuver DC unless it would already
      be higher.</p>
