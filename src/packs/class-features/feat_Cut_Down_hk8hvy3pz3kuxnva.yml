      <p>At 10th level, you become better with the implements of death and can
      add additional options to your repertoire. You can use
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.5u9ryymp8zndum2i]{Headsman&rsquo;s
      Cut} with a battle axe or bastard sword as well as a greataxe or
      greatsword. You can still only apply the bonus damage to a single weapon.
      If you have a shield or weapon in your other hand, you quickly skewer the
      severed head on your weapon, which cannot be wielded normally until you
      spend a bonus action to knock the head off (treat it as a club while the
      head is attached). The bonus damage from Headsman&rsquo;s Cut now applies
      whether you are raging or not, and while you are raging, you deal an
      additional 1d6 points of necrotic damage with a single weapon associated
      with the Headsman&rsquo;s Cut feature.</p>
