      <p>You can use your bonus action to focus your attention on a specific
      enemy. Choose a creature you can see within 90 feet to mark as your
      quarry. For 1 hour, you are focused on this creature. You gain a +1 bonus
      to weapon attack rolls against the creature, and your weapon attacks
      against it deal an extra 1d6 damage. In addition, you have advantage on
      Perception and Survival checks you make to find it. If the creature drops
      to 0 hit points before the hour ends, you can use a bonus action to mark a
      new quarry.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it
      again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
