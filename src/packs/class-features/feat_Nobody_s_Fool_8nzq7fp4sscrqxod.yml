  description:
    value: >-
      <p>People find it difficult to lie to you or to conceal their motives in
      your presence. You gain a bonus to Insight checks equal to your Charisma
      modifier. In addition, you can spend 1 sorcery point as an action to
      project an aura of honesty. For the next 10 minutes, creatures within 10
      feet of you have disadvantage on Deception checks made to lie or conceal
      the truth. When a creature in this aura fails a Deception check, it
      accidentally blurts out something it didn’t mean to while attempting to
      spin its lie.</p>
