      <p>At 4th level, you write a bardic tale of your adventures. Your bardic
      legend takes whatever form you like. When you enter a settlement and spend
      a day playing or recounting the tale, the reputation of youand your allies
      starts to grow. In addition to&nbsp;receiving local quests suited to the
      exploits&nbsp;detailed in your bardic legend, when you&nbsp;rest in a
      settlement that knows your bardic legend, you and your allies regain all
      spent&nbsp;hit dice over the course of a long rest. In&nbsp;addition, you
      gain an expertise die on<br>Prestige checks made in the
      settlement.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Starting at 7th level, you craft a second bardic legend. Commoners are
      either more amenable or afraid of you, depending on the type of bardic
      legend you create. Choose one of the following skills: Deception, Insight,
      Intimidation, or Persuasion. You&nbsp;gain advantage on checks made using
      the chosen skill to influence any commoner that&nbsp;has heard your bardic
      legend.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 11th level, whenever you&nbsp;enter a settlement, you can
      name a new&nbsp;bardic legend of your choice. Allies that are&nbsp;part of
      the tale gain inspiration when they&nbsp;finish a long rest in that
      settlement. Any&nbsp;other creatures that are part of that tale&nbsp;have
      their reputations ruined&mdash;either they&nbsp;confront you directly to
      stop the rumor, or&nbsp;they are unable to hide or deal in that
      town&nbsp;for the length of time you are in it. Once you&nbsp;have used
      this feature in a settlement, you&nbsp;can&rsquo;t do so again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
