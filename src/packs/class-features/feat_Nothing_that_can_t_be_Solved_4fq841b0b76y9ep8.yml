      <p>At 18th level, you can overcome obstacles with ease. When a creature
      that can understand you starts its turn you can grant it the ability to
      ignore all sources of disadvantage until the start of its next turn. After
      you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short
      or long rest .</p>
