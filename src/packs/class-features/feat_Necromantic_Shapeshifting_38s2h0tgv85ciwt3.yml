      <p>At 6th level, you can take the energy of undeath into yourself. When
      you use your Wild Shape ability, you can choose to shift into an undead
      version of one of your normal forms. An undead form has immunity to poison
      and necrotic damage, darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and gains an
      expertise die on Intimidation checks, but only receives half the normal
      amount of healing from magical healing spells, healing potions, and
      similar effects. It is also vulnerable to radiant damage.</p>
