      <p>You can come to others in dreams, conveying the word of your faith. You
      always have the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.jo2vztvypvhqxh5u]{Dream} spell
      prepared, and it is considered a cleric spell for you. You can cast it as
      part of taking a long rest without using material components or a spell
      slot. When you cast the spell in this way, you must be the messenger and
      cannot terrorize the target.</p>
