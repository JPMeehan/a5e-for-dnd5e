      <p>When you select this archetype at level 3, you gain proficiency with
      the History, Culture, and Religion skills. If you are already proficient
      in any of these skills, you gain an expertise die to any that apply. You
      also learn the shillelagh cantrip and the ceremony spell. Both count as
      Bard spells for you, but neither counts against your cantrips or spells
      known.&nbsp;</p>
