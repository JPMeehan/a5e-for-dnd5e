      <p dir="ltr">Beginning at 6th level, you may use your magic to temporarily
      improve your Undead Servant, giving it one of the following upgrades at
      the cost specified. These upgrades require an action to activate, and last
      until you complete a long rest. You may not use the same upgrade more than
      once per long rest, but you may have multiple upgrades active at a
      time.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Magical Fortitude</h3><p dir="ltr">You may use a
      spell slot to give your Undead Servant the ability to reroll one failed
      saving throw of your choice.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Unnatural Defence</h3><p
      dir="ltr">If you use a spell slot while you have a prepared spell from the
      Protection school, your Undead Servant increases its AC by a number equal
      to the level of the spell slot used.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Necrotic
      Power</h3><p dir="ltr">If you use a spell slot while you have a prepared
      spell from the Necrotic school, your Undead Servant deals an extra 1d4 +
      the spell slot level Necrotic damage.&nbsp;</p>
