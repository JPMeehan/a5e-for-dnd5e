      <p>Elementals are beings of pure elemental energy. Because of their nature
      and immunities, they can be the bane of elementalists, especially those
      who share their elemental affinity. But, you have learned to turn their
      elemental nature against them.</p>

      <p>Starting at 7th level, you can draw elemental energy directly from an
      elemental, gaining power and damaging them in the process. As an action,
      choose an elemental creature you can see within 60 feet. The creature must
      attempt a Constitution save against your spell save DC or take Force
      damage equal to your basic elemental blast damage. If it succeeds the
      save, it takes half damage. If it fails the save, you gain a free
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.ytcsa478xzuifmur]{Gather
      Energy}, except the temporary spell points granted are equal to your full
      proficiency bonus, and they last until the end of your next turn.</p>
