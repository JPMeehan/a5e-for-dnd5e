      <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can reshape mycelium around yourself to
      form armor. When you finish a short or long rest, you gain temporary hit
      points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier. When you reach level 15, you
      instead gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom score.</p>
