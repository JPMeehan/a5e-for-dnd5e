      <p dir="ltr">You gain tremorsense to a range of 30 ft. With tremorsense,
      you can detect and pinpoint the vibrations of creatures and moving objects
      which are in contact with the same surface. It can&rsquo;t detect flying
      or incorporeal creatures. If you do not move on your turn, you can send
      out a vibration that allows you to map your surroundings within 30 ft,
      detecting and pinpointing the locations of walls and other unmoving
      objects.</p>
