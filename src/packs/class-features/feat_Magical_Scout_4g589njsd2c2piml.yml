      <p>Your torch bearer form is a bit frilly, lacey, and perhaps even pink.
      The transformation is very distracting as it involves a lot of posing
      while your wardrobe changes and colorful magic swirls around you. Any
      creature that witnesses you enter your torch bearer form makes all
      Perception checks to notice anything but you at disadvantage until you
      leave your torch bearer form.</p>
