      <p>Starting at 6th level, you learn to listen to the wisdom and echoes of
      those that wielded it before you, ancient knowledge to guide and protect
      you in the trials of today. Whenever you enter your torch bearer form,
      choose a skill check or saving throw. Until you leave your torch bearer
      form you gain advantage on your chosen skill check or saving throw.</p>
