      <p>In emergencies when your own fortitude fails you can pull from the
      wellspring of power within your bonded artifact. Whenever you would fail a
      Constitution saving throw or gain a level of fatigue you can expend every
      remaining artifact charge instead. If you do, your bonded artifact cannot
      regain charges for the next 24 hours. You cannot use this feature if you
      have no artifact charges remaining.</p>
