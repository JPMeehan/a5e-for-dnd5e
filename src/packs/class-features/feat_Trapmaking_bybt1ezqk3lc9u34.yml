      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, with 10 minutes of work you can use your
      thieves’ tools to boobytrap a 5-footsquare area or a Large or smaller
      object. Your trap can be anything from a needle in a lock to a rockfall in
      a passageway. Describe the mechanics of your trap to the Narrator. Logic
      determines which traps can be built where; for instance, a swinging axe
      can’t be hidden in a jewelry box.</p><p>The trap’s DC is 8 + your
      Dexterity bonus + your proficiency bonus. A creature can spot the trap by
      making a Perception check against the trap’s DC. Creatures aware of the
      trap may avoid or disable it without a check. When a creature enters the
      trapped area or interacts with the trapped object it must succeed on a
      Dexterity saving throw against the trap’s DC. On a failure, the trap is
      triggered and the creature takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 damage
      times half your rogue level. The type of damage dealt (bludgeoning,
      piercing, slashing, or poison) is determined by the nature of your trap.
      Once a trap has been triggered, it is disabled. </p><p>You can use this
      feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all
      uses of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
