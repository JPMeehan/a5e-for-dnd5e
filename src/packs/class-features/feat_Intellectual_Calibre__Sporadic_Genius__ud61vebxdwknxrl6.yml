      <p>You&rsquo;re known for sudden bursts of insight and people listen to
      your fervorous insights. When you or another creature you can see within
      30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your
      reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this
      feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
      once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
