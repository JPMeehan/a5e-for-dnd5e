      <p>At 7th level, your attitudes and academic manners have cemented how you
      and your intellect are perceived by your peers.</p><h3><strong>Sporadic
      Genius</strong></h3><p>Youâ€™re known for sudden bursts of insight and
      people listen to your fervorous insights. When you or another creature you
      can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw,
      you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.
      You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence
      modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a
      long rest.</p>
