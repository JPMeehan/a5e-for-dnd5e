      <p>At 14th level, you gain a grade 4 Sacred Grove stronghold. In addition
      to the normal benefits it also contains a circle of standing stones that
      map the stars. You always have the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.bs3wnsid88tbup6c]{Divination} and
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.qsa7b22n3y1pbzf6]{Augury} spells
      prepared and they do not count against your number of prepared spells.
      While in your Sacred Grove you may cast each of these spells once per long
      rest with out expending a spell slot, and in your grove you always count
      as being able to see the night sky even if you cannot (if you are blind,
      if it is daytime, etc.).</p>
