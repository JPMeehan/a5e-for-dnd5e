      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you tap into a ferocious sort of vitality. When
      you are reduced to 0 hit points or less you can immediately make a death
      saving throw. On a success, you instead gain a number of hit points equal
      to your Constitution modifier and do not lose the benefits of &nbsp;your
      rage. Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
