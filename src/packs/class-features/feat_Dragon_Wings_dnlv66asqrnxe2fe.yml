      <p dir="ltr">At 14th level, your rage causes you to sprout a massive set
      of dragon wings that can carry you aloft. While raging, you gain a fly
      speed equal to double your walking speed. If you become bloodied while
      flying, your wings are too damaged to keep you aloft, and you descend as
      though under the effects of the feather fall spell instead of
      flying.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, if you already possess the Draconian Wings
      heritage feature, you no longer suffer fatigue while using your wings. If
      you become bloodied while flying, your flying speed reduces to 30 feet
      instead of descending as noted above.</p>
