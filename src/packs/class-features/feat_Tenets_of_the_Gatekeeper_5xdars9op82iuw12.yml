      <p>All gatekeepers follow a similar set of tenets.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Close Shut the Outer Gates.</strong> The realms beyond this
      world are alien and dangerous. They must be kept separate and apart, and
      the natural order of the cosmos maintained.</li>

      <li><strong>Unwelcome Spirits. </strong>Beings from distant planes are as
      dangerous and alien as the realms they hail from. They must never trusted,
      and extinguished or driven back wherever they are found.</li>

      <li><strong>Trust in What is Real. </strong>The physical world is the only
      truly real one. Worship the gods if you will, but let the gods stay in
      their heavens. You live in the world. Do not forget that.</li>

      <li><strong>Exorcism.</strong> Everyone&rsquo;s body and mind belongs to
      themself. Do not tolerate possessions, and end such corruption wherever it
      is found. Even a willing possession is an abomination.</li>

      </ul>
