      <p>You can survey the scene of a grave injustice or atrocity and instantly
      know who is responsible, both for the actual action itself and anyone who
      ordered it. The responsible parties are immediately marked as per your
      Render Verdict ability (no save). Nothing short of the wish spell or the
      intervention of a deity can thwart this feature.</p>
