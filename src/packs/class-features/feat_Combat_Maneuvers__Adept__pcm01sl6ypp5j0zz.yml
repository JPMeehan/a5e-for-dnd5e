      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers.
      You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list:
      Mirror&rsquo;s Glint, Rapid Current, Razor&rsquo;s Edge, Unending Wheel.
      You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient
      with.</p>

      <p>You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You
      use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool, and you
      regain all spent exertion when you finish a rest. The Maneuvers Known
      column of the Adept table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a
      tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows
      the highest-degree maneuver you can select at a given level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
      the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
      degree from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>

      <p>As an adept, you gain a +1 bonus to your maneuver DC.</p>
