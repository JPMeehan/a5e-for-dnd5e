      <p dir="ltr">Finally, at 2nd level, armor and weapons made of organic
      materials are more durable thanks to your connection with the magical
      rhythms of the world. When a weapon or suit of armor made primarily of
      bone, cloth, hide, leather, or wood would break, you may spend a nexus
      point to prevent the item from breaking.</p>
