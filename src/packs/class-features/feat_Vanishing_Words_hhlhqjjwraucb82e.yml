      <p>Starting at 13th level, your words have the power to make people forget
      their interactions with you. As an action, you can make a Deception check
      contested by the Insight of one creature who can hear and understand you
      within 30 feet. If you win the contest, the target forgets anything you
      have said over the last 5 minutes. You can choose for the target to
      believe instead that you were either silent the entire time or engaged in
      meaningless small talk. The first time a bystander reminds the target of
      your interaction with them, the target can make a Wisdom&nbsp;<span

      your Charisma modifier.</p>

      class="freelinking-link">long rest</span> before you can do so again.</p>
