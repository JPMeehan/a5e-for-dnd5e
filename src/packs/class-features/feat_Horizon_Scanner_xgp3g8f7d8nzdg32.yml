      dir="ltr">At 7th level, your vision has grown keen from long practice
      looking for subtle signs at great distances. You can see through heavily
      obscured areas as though they were lightly obscured, and through lightly
      obscured areas as though they were not obscured. If you have darkvision,
      this feature allows you to see in darkness as though it were bright light
      within the range of your darkvision, and as though it were dim light
      beyond that range, although you still can only perceive shades of gray in
      the dark. If you do not have darkvision, this feature functionally gives
      you darkvision at unlimited range.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you have advantage on sight-based Perception
      checks, and when visibility is clear you can make out fine details at
      extreme ranges, easily discerning creatures and objects as small as 2 feet
      across.</p>
