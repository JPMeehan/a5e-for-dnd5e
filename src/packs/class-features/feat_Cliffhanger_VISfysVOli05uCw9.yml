      you start falling, you can use your reaction to make a Strength or
      Dexterity saving throw against the DC of whatever effect caused you to
      fall, or a DC of 10 if there is no obvious DC. On a success, you reach out
      and grab a ledge that can support your weight (if one is available) and
      stop falling. If you do not have an open hand to grab the ledge, you can
      drop an item you are holding as part of this reaction.</span></p>
