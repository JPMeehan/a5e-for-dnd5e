      <p>You can use an action to unleash your Eldritch Blast against creatures
      within a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area makes
      a Dexterity saving throw, taking force damage equal to 1d10 x your
      proficiency bonus on a failure, or half damage on a success.</p><p>Once
      you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or
      long rest. You also regain the use of this feature after you&rsquo;ve
      spent 5 spell points to cast a spell or use other features.</p>
