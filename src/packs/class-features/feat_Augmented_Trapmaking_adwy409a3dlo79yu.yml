      <p>At 9th level, you learn one of the following trap capabilities. When
      using Trapmaking to create a trap, you can choose to augment it with the
      new capability, which is triggered when your trap damages a creature.</p>

      <h2>Immobilization Trap</h2>

      <p>The target is caught in the jaws of the trap. The target&rsquo;s
      movement speed is reduced to 0. A creature can use an action or legendary
      action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature
      on a success. Building this trap requires a hunting trap, which can be
      recovered after the trap is triggered.</p>

      <h2>Poison Trap</h2>

      <p>You add a contact or injury poison to the trap, which consumes the
      poison. The victim of the trap is affected by the poison.</p>

      <h2>Vial Trap</h2>

      <p>You add a vial of liquid, such as acid or alchemists&rsquo; fire, to
      the trap, which consumes the liquid. Each creature within 5 feet when the
      trap is triggered makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the
      creature is splashed with the liquid.</p>
