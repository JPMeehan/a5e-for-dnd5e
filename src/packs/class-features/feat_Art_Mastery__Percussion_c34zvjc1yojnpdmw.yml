      <p>You can throw a spell's magic, rebounding it from one place to another.
      When using this musical art as a spell focus, if you cast a spell that
      targets only one creature, you can target an additional creature within
      range of the first (as if it were casting the spell). Once you have used
      this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, you
      can't do so again until you finish a short rest.</p>
