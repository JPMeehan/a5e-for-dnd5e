      <p>You seem to swallow the light around you, decreasing the ambient light
      level by 1 step (from bright light to dim light, from dim light to
      darkness, and from darkness to magical darkness). You can suppress this
      darkness at will (no action required). Your claws now deal an additional
      1d6 points of necrotic damage if you are in darkness or magical
      darkness.</p>
