      <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-2b542edf-7fff-b9ab-2b78-cf4f8a93ddf6">You
      gain proficiency with checks using a forgery kit. If you are already
      proficient with checks using a forgery kit, you instead gain an expertise
      die. In addition, you can spend a week engaging in a campaign to discredit
      an enemy using forged letters and other made-up evidence of misdeeds. Make
      an Intelligence check with a forgery kit with a DC equal to the passive
      prestige of your enemy. If you succeed, they are afflicted with a random
      short term mental-stress effect and their prestige is reduced by the
      amount you beat their DC by for the purposes of retaining followers and
      calling in favors for [[/r 1d6]] days or until they take active steps to
      clean up their reputation (at the DM&rsquo;s discretion, the negative
      effects could be more long lasting). On a failure (or a successful opposed
      Investigation roll by an interested party), your deceit is known to your
      target and the general public.&nbsp;</span></p>
