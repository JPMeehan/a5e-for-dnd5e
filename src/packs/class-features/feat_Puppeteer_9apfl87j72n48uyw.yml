      always felt like your power came from somewhere else; an imaginary friend,
      your conscience, your desires, a mischievous spirit. Maybe the second
      coming to you is a surprise. Regardless, your power has grown beyond your
      body and taken up residence in the form of a small companion elemental.
      The appearance of these elementals are as unique as the elementalists
      themselves, but they are all united in being made of their
      element.</span></p>
