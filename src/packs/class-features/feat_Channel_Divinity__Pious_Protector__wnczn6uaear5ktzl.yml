      <p>At 4th level, you are able to channel the energy of your greater entity
      directly and use it for a variety of magical effects. You start with one
      of these effects: Turn Undead. As you advance, you may learn more from
      other sources.</p><p>You may choose which Channel Divinity effect to
      create each time you use this feature. You must then finish a short or
      long rest before you&rsquo;re able to Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some
      Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. The DC for this is the
      same as your pious protector spell save DC.</p><h3><strong>Channel
      Divinity: Turn Undead</strong></h3><p>As an action, you present the holy
      symbol of your greater entity and speak a divine word, rebuking the
      undead. Each undead creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you must
      make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails it is turned for 1
      minute or until it takes damage from any source.&nbsp;</p><p>A turned
      creature must use its turns trying to move as far away from you as
      possible. It cannot willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It
      also cannot take reactions. On its action, it can use only the Dash action
      or try to escape any effect that prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s
      nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
