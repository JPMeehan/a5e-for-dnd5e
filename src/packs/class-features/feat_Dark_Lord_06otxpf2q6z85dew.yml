      <p>At level 18, the tales of your terrible nature have spread far and
      wide. Choose two of the following benefits: </p><h3><strong>Burning
      Gaze</strong> </h3><p>A mere look from you can set creatures and
      structures aflame. As a bonus action, you may select a number of targets
      up to your Charisma modifier you can see within 120 feet. They all take
      1d6 fire damage and 1d6 ongoing fire damage until a creature spends an
      action to extinguish the flames.</p><h3><strong>Unholy Resilience</strong>
      </h3><p>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. You
      also have resistance to necrotic damage and to non-magical bludgeoning,
      piercing, and slashing damage.</p><h3><strong>Master of Fear
      </strong></h3><p>You may now use Sower of Terror at will, and as a bonus
      action.</p><h3><strong>Aura of Slaughter </strong></h3><p>The bonus damage
      of Bloodthirsty increases to 1d8 necrotic damage, and enemy creatures
      within your Commanding Presence have disadvantage on death saving
      throws.</p>
