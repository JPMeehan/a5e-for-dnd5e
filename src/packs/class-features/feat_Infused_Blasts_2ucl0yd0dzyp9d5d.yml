      <p>Starting at 6th level, you learn how to harness the power you&rsquo;ve
      stolen. Once each round when you use
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.ulmcmf3ofmpzmgzf]{Eldritch
      Blast}, you can expend 1 mana point to alter its structure as a free
      action. Choose one of the following:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can push more power into the ability, increasing your eldritch
      blast&rsquo;s damage by one die.</li>

      <li>You can alter the probability around the target. In addition to taking
      damage from the eldritch blast, it has disadvantage on its next roll.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If the attack is unsuccessful, the mana is lost. Expending mana does
      not allow you to absorb any additional mana points. These effects stack
      with any Eldritch Invocations you can use (though the damage is added and
      not multiplied in the case of abilities like
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.06hw3ebdcpq2fzgi]{Eldritch
      Squall}).</p>
