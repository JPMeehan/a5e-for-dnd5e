    value: >-
      <p>You learn the true name of an imp or quasit, and by speaking it and
      expending a hit die you may call it forth as a familiar. You may later
      dismiss this familiar back to its home plane as an action by spending
      another hit die, and you cannot temporarily dismiss it into a pocket
      dimension. It otherwise follows the normal rules for the find familiar
      spell.</p><p>If both this and Celestial Lore are taken, it allows you to
      have two familiars at once, though summoning the second one without
      dismissing the first inflicts a level of fatigue in addition to the normal
      costs.</p>
