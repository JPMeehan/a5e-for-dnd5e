      <p>Your blending of the martial and the clandestine reaches its apex. When
      you hit with a weapon attack against a creature that is unaware of your
      presence, you deal an additional 1d8 of damage. Your critical hit range
      for attacks against a creature unaware of your presence increases to
      17-20.</p>

      <p>A creature that suffers a critical hit from such an attack must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC or become rattled for one
      minute. If they fail this save by more than 5, they are also stunned until
      the end of their next turn.</p>
