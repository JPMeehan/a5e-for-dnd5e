    value: >-
      <p>Your blending of the martial and the clandestine reaches its apex. When
      you hit with a weapon attack against a creature that is unaware of your
      presence, you deal an additional 1d8 of damage. Your critical hit range
      for attacks against a creature unaware of your presence increases to
      17-20.</p><p>A creature that suffers a critical hit from such an attack
      must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC or become
      <em>rattled</em> for one minute. If they fail this save by more than 5,
      they are also <em>stunned</em> until the end of their next turn.</p>
