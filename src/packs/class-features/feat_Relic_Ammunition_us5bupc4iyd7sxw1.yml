      <p>Your weapon can manifest magical ammunition made directly from the
      artifact&rsquo;s power. Whenever you make an attack using your weapon of
      power you can choose to manifest and fire magical ammunition by expending
      an artifact charge. If you do, that attack gains an attack and damage
      bonus equal to your wielder spellcasting modifier. You can manifest this
      magical ammunition up to a number of times equal to your proficiency
      bonus, and regain all expended uses whenever you finish a short rest.</p>
