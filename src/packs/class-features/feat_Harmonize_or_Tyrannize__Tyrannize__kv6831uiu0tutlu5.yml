      <p>At 15th level you choose to harmonize with nature or to harness it.
      Choose one of the
      following:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>TYRANNIZE</strong></h3><p>You draw upon
      nature’s power to become a prime example of one of its children. Whenever
      you assume a wild shape you may choose to assume the apex form of that
      wild shape. An apex form is one size category larger than the creature’s
      normal size category (maximum Gargantuan) and any attack made by an apex
      form wild shape deals an extra 1d8 damage. In addition, while in an apex
      form wild shape you gain an expertise die on Strength, Dexterity, and
      Constitution checks and saving throws.</p>
