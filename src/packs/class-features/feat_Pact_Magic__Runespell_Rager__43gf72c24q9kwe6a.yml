      <p dir="ltr">Through care, practice, and meditation you have drawn magic
      from your soul and distant realms, focused through runic scarring and
      mystical tattooing. As you cast spells, scars and tattoos on your body may
      disappear, only to return later when you recover your spell points.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to cast spells
      through pact magic, even though you may not necessarily have a patron.
      This feature is identical to the warlock pact magic feature with the
      following changes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr">You
      use the Runespell Rager table to determine how many spells and cantrips
      you know, what level you can cast spells, and how many spell points you
      have.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr">You use the
      runespell rager spell list instead of the warlock spell
      list.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>
