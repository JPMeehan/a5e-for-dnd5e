      <p>At 7th level, your overbearing strength allows you to shrug off blows.
      Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you gain a number of temporary
      hit points equal to twice your Strength modifier. When you reach 15th
      level, you instead gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your
      Strength score.</p>
