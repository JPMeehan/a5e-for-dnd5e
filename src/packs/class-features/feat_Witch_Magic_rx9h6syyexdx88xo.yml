      <p>At 2nd level, you choose one of three broad magical paths you will
      walk: White Magic, Gray Magic, or Black Magic. The chosen path expands
      your witch spell list, adding additional spells to it. You can choose
      spells from this ability when preparing your spell list. If you would
      choose a spell that is not on the witch spell list, it is considered a
      witch spell for you.</p><h3>White Magic</h3><p>You add the law, good,
      radiant, and healing schools of magic to your list of witch
      spells.</p><h3>Grey Magic</h3><p>You add the force and prismatic schools
      of magic to your list of witch spells, as well as your choice of two
      schools from fire, air, cold, earth, lightning, thunder, or
      water.</p><h3>Black Magic</h3><p>You add the chaos, evil, necrotic, and
      shadow schools of magic to your witch spells.</p>
