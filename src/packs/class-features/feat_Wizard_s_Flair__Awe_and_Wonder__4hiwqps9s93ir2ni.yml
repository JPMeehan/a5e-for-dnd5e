      <p>At 9th level, you have created a flair that you use when casting
      spells. Choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a long
      rest, you may replace your flair with another.</p><p>Whenever you cast a
      spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose to cast it with your flair.
      You can do so again when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><h3><strong>Awe and Wonder</strong></h3><p>Choose one creature
      affected by the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
      charmed by you until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way,
      it is incapacitated, has a movement speed of 0, and does nothing but stare
      blankly at the dazzling effects of your magic. If it takes any damage or
      is forced to make another saving throw, the charm effect
      ends.</p><h3></h3>
