      <p>At 6th level you master a technique passed down through countless
      generations of druids. Choose one of the
      following:</p><h3><strong>Traditional Spells</strong></h3><p>Your circle
      has practiced and perfected several spells that you have memorized by
      rote. When you first gain this feature, select 3 spells from the Air,
      Beasts, Earth, Healing, Nature, Plants, Terrain, Water, or Weather schools
      as your traditional spells. </p><p>You may select up to two additional
      traditional spells from those schools at your 7th, 9th, and 11th druid
      levels. You always have your traditional spells prepared and they don’t
      count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. </p><p>If you
      select a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is a
      druid spell for you.</p>
