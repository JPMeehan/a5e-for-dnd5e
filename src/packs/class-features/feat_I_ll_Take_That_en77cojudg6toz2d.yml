      <p>Beginning at level 14, you learn the sneakiest ability of all: the
      ability to steal the spell knowledge of other wizards. When you see a
      spell being cast, you may make an Arcana check with a DC equal to 10 + the
      spell&rsquo;s level. If you succeed and the spell appears on the Wizard,
      Sorcerer, and/or Warlock spell list, you hold the spell in your mind. You
      can write a spell kept in mind in this way into your spellbook as if you
      had another spellbook or spell scroll to copy from. You can only hold one
      spell in mind in this way at once, but you may release a held spell at any
      time, freeing the space for a different spell.</p>
