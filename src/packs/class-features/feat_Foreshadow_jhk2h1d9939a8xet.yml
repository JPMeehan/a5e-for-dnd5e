      <p>Also at 3rd level, you can choose one creature who can benefit from
      your Bardic Inspiration and spend two uses. Then, narrate a single action
      that creature could take the following turn. If the creature attempts that
      action before the end of your next turn, it can add an additional Bardic
      Inspiration die to the roll. If it cannot attempt this action or chooses
      not to, it is affected by your Bardic Inspiration as normal.</p>
