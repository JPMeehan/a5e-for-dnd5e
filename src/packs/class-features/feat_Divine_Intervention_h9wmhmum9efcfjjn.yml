      <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use an action to call on your deity to
      intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Describe the assistance
      you seek and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower
      than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The Narrator chooses the
      nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric
      archetype spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you canâ€™t
      use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after
      you finish a long rest.</p><p>After each failed divine intervention roll,
      add 1 to the number required to succeed until it is a success, at which
      point it resets to your cleric level or below.</p><p>At 20th level, your
      call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>
