      <p>When you cast a spell that requires concentration while already
      concentrating on another spell, you can maintain concentration on both
      spells simultaneously. If you&rsquo;re forced to make a Constitution
      saving throw to maintain concentration, the minimum DC is 10 + the
      combined levels of the two spells. On a failure, both spells end.</p>
