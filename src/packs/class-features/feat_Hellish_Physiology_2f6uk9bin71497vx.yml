      <p>At 6th level, your appearance becomes more fiendish. Choose one of the
      following options:</p>

      <h2>Fiery Wings</h2>

      <p>You sprout a pair of wings (with an appearance chosen by you when you
      select this option). Your wings grant you a fly speed equal to your
      walking speed. Creatures grappling you take 1d4 points of fire damage.</p>

      <h2>Claws of Darkness</h2>

      <p>Your finger nails lengthen and sharpen into fearsome talons. You can
      make unarmed attacks with these claws, which have the finesse and vicious
      properties, dealing 1d8 slashing damage. With these claws only, you can
      make two attacks rather than one when you take the Attack action.</p>
