      <p>At 4th level the presence of your bonded artifact has not gone
      unnoticed and your relic gives you a certain amount of gravitas. When you
      gain this feature, your prestige rating increases by 1. In addition,
      whenever you fail a prestige check you may immediately roll [[/r 1d4]] and
      add it to the result, potentially turning a failure into a success. If you
      succeed on a prestige check in this way, the character has heard of your
      bonded artifact, but not you.</p>
