      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to get in
      the heads of your opponents. After you have observed a creature in combat
      for at least 1 round, you can make a quip at it. Make an Intimidation
      check opposed by the Wisdom saving throw of a creature within 30 feet that
      can hear and understand you. On a failed save the creature is compelled to
      attack you. On its turn, the creature moves towards you and makes as many
      attacks against you as it can. If the creature failed its saving throw by
      5 or more, it has disadvantage on these attack rolls. Additionally, you do
      not have to spend exertion to use
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.w24z3b4ki0c5pusd]{Focused
      Defense} while a creature is under this effect.</p>

      <p>The effects of this feature end after the creature hits you with an
      attack, when you attack a different creature, or if the creature is unable
      to attack you. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to
      your Wisdom modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
