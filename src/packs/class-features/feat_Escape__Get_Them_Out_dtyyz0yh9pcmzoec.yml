      <p>When an ally within range of your Commanding Presence would make a
      saving throw against an area effect, you can use your reaction to shout at
      them and your ally can use their reaction to move up to half their Speed.
      If your ally ends their movement outside the area, the area effect has no
      effect on them. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
