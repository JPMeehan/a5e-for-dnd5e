      <p>Knowledge of the terrain can be the difference between victory and
      defeat. By spending 10 minutes observing the area in a 2-mile radius you
      can spend 2 exertion points to pick out where there are choke points,
      large swathes of cover,  watercourses, vegetations that can offer
      concealment, ridgelines, and so on. You gain an expertise die on
      Engineering and Survival checks made within the area, and on checks made
      to prepare an ambush or realize you are being ambushed.</p>
