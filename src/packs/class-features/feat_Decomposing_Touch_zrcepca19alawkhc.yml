      <p>At 6th level, you learn to use your unique connection to the cycle of
      death and rebirth to your advantage. While in your normal form or swarm
      form, you can use an action to touch the corpse of a Medium or larger
      creature that has been dead for 10 days or less and magically regain one
      expended spell slot. The spell slot you regain can&rsquo;t be higher than
      5th&nbsp; level or half your character level, whichever is lower. When you
      use this ability, the corpse you touch rapidly decomposes and becomes
      unrecognizable. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish
      a&nbsp;short or long rest.</p>
