      <p>You can treat both lightning and thunder as your manifestationâ€™s damage
      types. When you cast a spell that deals lightning or thunder damage, you
      can spend 1 sorcery point to produce a thunderous blast around you. Large
      or smaller creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Strength
      saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed back 10 feet and
      knocked prone.</p>
