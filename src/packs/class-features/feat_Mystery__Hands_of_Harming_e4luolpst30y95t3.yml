      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You gain a pool of
      points equal to your witch level. As an action you may make a melee spell
      attack against a creature. On a hit, they take necrotic damage equal to
      the number of expended points and the target cannot regain hit points
      until the start of your next turn. You must decide how many points your
      are spending before the attack roll is made.</p>
