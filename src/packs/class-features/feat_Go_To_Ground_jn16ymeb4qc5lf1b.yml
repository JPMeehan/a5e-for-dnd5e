      <p>You can flee to a new location without leaving a trail. To do so, you
      must spend 24 hours preparing (cleaning out your residence, covering up
      your paper trail, planting false clues, and so on) and then promptly
      depart the location. Your trail goes completely cold, confounding even
      those concretely aware of your previous location with the multiple
      conflicting sets of evidence you left behind. Fleeing in this way grants
      you an expertise die and advantage on Deception checks to conceal your
      destination, point of departure, and personal identity for three days
      after your departure. Once you have used this feature, you must wait a
      week before you can use it again.</p>
