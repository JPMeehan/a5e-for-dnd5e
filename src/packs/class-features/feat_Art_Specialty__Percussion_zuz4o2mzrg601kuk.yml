      <p>Any instrument played by being struck or scraped (either by other
      instruments or against each other) qualifies as a percussion instrument.
      When using this musical art as a spell focus, you double the ranges of
      bard spells from the sound school. A sound spell that has a range of Touch
      increases its range to 30 feet.</p>
