      dir="ltr">At 18th level, once between long rests, instead of rolling
      initiative, you can instead arrange the initiative order however you see
      fit, placing combatants on initiative counts 1-20. You cannot place more
      than one creature on a given initiative count unless all other initiative
      counts are filled. If the combat includes creatures with Legendary
      Resistance, they roll initiative normally, but you may adjust the
      initiative of one such creature up or down by an amount equal to your
      Intelligence modifier and may still affect all other creatures in the
      combat. Creatures entering combat on subsequent rounds roll initiative
      normally.</p>
