      <p>At 6th level you gain additional benefits when using the Visual art
      specialty as a spell focus. If you cast a spell has vocalized components
      you can ignore those components as long as you are capable of performing a
      seen component, and a spell cast in this way gains a seen component if it
      does not already have one; if you cast a spell that requires a target to
      hear you, you can use it on any target that can see you.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Furthermore, while using the Visual art specialty as your spell focus
      if you make a spell attack roll and miss or force a creature to make a
      saving throw and they succeed you can expend a use of bardic inspiration
      as a reaction to make a performance check, applying the dance specialty if
      you have it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can replace
      your spell attack roll or your spell save DC with the result of the check,
      potentially altering the result of the roll.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can do so a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long
      rest.</p>
