      <p>At 2nd level when you take this archetype, you tap into some inky well
      of fell power. Spells of the Necrotic and Undead schools become druid
      spells for you. You also learn the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.bpkked98u8mb2q3w]{Chill
      Touch}</em>&nbsp;cantrip, which does not count against your cantrips
      known.</p>
