      <p>Some savants are prepared to bloody their knuckles in a fight, while
      others make a point of staying out of the scrum. At 2nd level, you choose
      one of the following poises.</p>

      <h2>A Step Ahead</h2>

      <p>You have a deft ability to predict your opponents&rsquo; responses and
      interfere with them. Whenever a creature within your reach that you are
      aware of attempts to take a reaction, you can expend your reaction for the
      round to try to disrupt them. That creature must make an Intelligence
      saving throw against your trick DC. If they fail, their reaction is
      wasted.</p>

      <h2>Combat Maneuvers</h2>

      <p>You gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. (Combat maneuvers are
      detailed in the Level Up Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide.) You gain an exertion
      point pool equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p>Choose two martial traditions. (Most savants learn maneuvers of the
      traditions Biting Zephyr, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current, or Sanguine
      Knot.) Whenever you gain a savant trick, you can instead choose a maneuver
      from any of your chosen martial traditions.</p>

      <p>You can initially learn maneuvers of the 1st degree. At 7th level you
      gain access to 2nd degree maneuvers, then at 13th level you can access 3rd
      degree maneuvers, and finally at 19th level you can access 4th degree
      maneuvers.</p>
