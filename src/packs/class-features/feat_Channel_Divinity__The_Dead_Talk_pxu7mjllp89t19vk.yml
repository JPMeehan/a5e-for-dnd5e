      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you may use your Channel Divinity to
      temporarily animate the body or a pile of bones of a creature you touch.
      Upon doing so, the undead mutters the name (if any) and the creature type
      (such as Giant or Humanoid - the GM may choose to be more specific, such
      as stating Orc, or Elf) of the creature that killed it. For the next 24
      hours, you or a creature of your choosing gains advantage on the next
      ability check made regarding the creature (such as a History check to
      recall something about it, or a Survival check to track it) or attack roll
      made against it.</p>
