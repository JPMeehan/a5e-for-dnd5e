      <p>Your nature may intimidate your enemies, but never your friends.
      Children and animals, as well as the very old, instinctually trust you,
      and you gain an expertise die on Persuasion and Animal Handling checks
      against them.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you take this knack, you gain one minor skill or
      hobby, such as whittling, whistling, cooking, or knitting. When you make a
      Persuasion or Animal Handling check where you can apply that minor skill
      or hobby, your expertise die increases to 1d6.</p>
