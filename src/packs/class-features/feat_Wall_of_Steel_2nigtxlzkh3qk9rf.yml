      <p>Beginning at 11th level, you become a master at defending yourself
      against incoming attacks.</p>

      <p>You may use a Fencer&rsquo;s Arsenal weapon's parrying ability as a
      reaction with this feature, and when using this feature, the once per turn
      limitation of a parrying weapon is ignored.</p>

      <p>While wielding one of your Fencer&rsquo;s Arsenal weapons, when you
      would use your reaction to perform a parry, opportunity attack, or a
      combat maneuver, you can use this feature to do so without expending your
      reaction, up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus each
      round. You pay exertion costs normally, and any of these actions after the
      first without an exertion cost instead costs 1 exertion.</p>

      <p>If you use a reaction to perform any other task (such as casting a
      spell), you cannot use this feature until the beginning of your next turn;
      likewise, if you use this feature you cannot use your reaction other than
      to perform a parry, opportunity attack, or combat maneuver until the
      beginning of your next turn.</p>
