      <p>You become a master at defending yourself against incoming attacks.
      While wielding one of your Fencerâ€™s Arsenal weapons, when you use your
      reaction to perform a parry, opportunity attack, or a combat maneuver, you
      can use this feature to do so without expending your reaction, up to a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus each round. You pay
      exertion costs normally, and any of these actions after the first without
      an exertion cost instead costs 1 exertion.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use a
      reaction to perform any other task (such as casting a spell), you cannot
      use this feature until the beginning of your next turn; likewise, if you
      use this feature you cannot use your reaction other than to perform a
      parry, opportunity attack, or combat maneuver until the beginning of your
      next turn.</p>
