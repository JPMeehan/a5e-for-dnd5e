      <p dir="ltr">The heavens smile upon your sacrifices. When you take the
      Pray journey activity, critical failures count as failures, failures
      become successes, successes become critical successes, and critical
      successes also grant a point of favor as per the Religious Devotion
      downtime activity. (Points of favor gained in this way are immediately
      lost if you act against the interests or philosophies of the entities you
      connected with using the Pray journey activity.)</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you can always choose to use Religion when
      performing the Religious Devotion downtime activity and have advantage on
      checks to do so.</p>
