      <p>By 7th level you have doubled down on your battle defense style. Choose
      one of the following.</p>

      <h2>Enhanced Vitality</h2>

      <p>Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. When you make the chosen
      saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you
      can choose to instead make a Constitution saving throw.</p>

      <h2>Preternatural Agility</h2>

      <p>You can evade danger to an unbelievable degree. When you make a
      Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a
      success, you take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.</p>
