      <p dir="ltr">At 14th level, you have learned how to use the natural forces
      around you to compel the undead to obey you. You may expend a use of your
      Wild Shape feature to force an undead you can see within 60ft to make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure the undead
      becomes a loyal servant to nature, willing to obey you for a number of
      hours equal to your Wisdom modifier. It remains under your control until
      this time passes, you choose to end the effect, it is reduced to 0 hit
      points, or you use this feature again.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Each time the undead takes damage, it makes a new saving
      throw against this effect, ending it on a success.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">The undead has its own turn, rolling its own initiative.
      While it is within 60 feet, you can use a bonus action to mentally command
      the undead. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves
      during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding
      an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The
      undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">A creature of a higher challenge rating than your druid level
      automatically succeeds on its saving throw.</p>
