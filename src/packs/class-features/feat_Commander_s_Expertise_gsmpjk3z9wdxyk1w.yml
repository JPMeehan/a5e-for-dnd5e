      <p>Whenever a creature uses your Commanding Presence to make an attack or
      use a combat maneuver, it gains an expertise die. If the combat maneuver
      has a save DC, it increases by an amount equal to the result of the
      expertise die. This expertise die can be increased to a maximum of a
