      <p>Your bonded artifact&rsquo;s power surges whenever you use it artfully,
      responding to the skills of a worthy wielder. Whenever you critically hit
      a creature with a weapon or spell attack using your bonded artifact, it
      regains up to one spent charge. Your artifact only responds to skill used
      against worthy opponents however, and you do not regain spent charges if
      the target has a CR lower than &frac14; of your character level.</p>
