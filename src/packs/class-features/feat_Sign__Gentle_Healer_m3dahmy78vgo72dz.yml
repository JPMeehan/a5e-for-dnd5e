      <p>During a short rest, you can spend uses from your healerâ€™s satchel to
      aid your allies in their recovery. A creature you choose may roll expended
      hit dice twice, taking the higher result. You may not expend your own hit
      dice while using this feature, since you use all of your energies to heal
      your companions.</p>
