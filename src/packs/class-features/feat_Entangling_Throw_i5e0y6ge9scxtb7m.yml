      <p>At 11th level, at the end of each short rest, you can put together a
      number of bundles of such materials equal to your proficiency bonus, each
      costing 5 silver worth of raw materials. Alternatively, if the Narrator
      determines the environment is suitable, you can collect the maximum amount
      of such materials at no cost on a successful Survival check to Hunt and
      Gather, while gaining half the usual amount of supply (rounded
      down).</p><p>Once each turn, you can spend 1 exertion to make an
      entangling throw at a target within 20 feet with a ranged weapon attack
      you are considered proficient at, either expending a bundle of material or
      using what is available in the environment (at Narrator discretion). You
      do not have disadvantage from making an entangling throw at a creature you
      have hit with a melee weapon attack since the start of your last turn from
      being within its reach. On a hit, the target makes a Strength check
      against your maneuver DC or becomes grappled. At the start of each of its
      turns, the target repeats the check, ending the effect on itself on a
      success. The material from the entangling throw can also be destroyed (AC
      equal to your maneuver DC, hit points equal to your adept
      level).</p><p>Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to
      your Wisdom modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
