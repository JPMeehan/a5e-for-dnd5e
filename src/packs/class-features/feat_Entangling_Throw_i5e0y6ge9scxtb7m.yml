      <p>At 11th level, at the end of each short rest, you can put together a
      number of bundles of such materials equal to your proficiency bonus, each
      costing 5 silver worth of raw materials. Alternatively, if the Narrator
      determines the environment is suitable, you can collect the maximum amount
      of such materials at no cost on a successful Survival check to Hunt and
      Gather, while gaining half the usual amount of supply (rounded down).</p>

      <p>Once each turn, you can spend 1 exertion to make an entangling throw at
      a target within 20 feet with a ranged weapon attack you are considered
      proficient at, either expending a bundle of material or using what is
      available in the environment (at Narrator discretion). You do not have
      disadvantage from making an entangling throw at a creature you have hit
      with a melee weapon attack since the start of your last turn from being
      within its reach. On a hit, the target makes a Strength check against your
      maneuver DC or becomes grappled. At the start of each of its turns, the
      target repeats the check, ending the effect on itself on a success. The
      material from the entangling throw can also be destroyed (AC equal to your
      maneuver DC, hit points equal to your adept level).</p>

      <p>Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom
      modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
