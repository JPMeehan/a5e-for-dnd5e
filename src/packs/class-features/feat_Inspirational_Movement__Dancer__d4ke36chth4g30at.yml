      <p>You can expend a use of bardic inspiration as an action to target a
      creature that can see you within 30 ft.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you do so, that creature can take two actions on
      their following turn, though only one of them can be used to cast a spell
      of 1st level or higher. Once a creature has benefited from this ability,
      they cannot do so again until they finish a long rest.</p>
