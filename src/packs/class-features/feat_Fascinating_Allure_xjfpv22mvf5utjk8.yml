      <p>You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks, and may always choose
      to use your spellcasting ability modifier on Persuasion checks, in
      addition when a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell you
      cast that would charm them, you may make a Persuasion check opposed by
      their saving throw. On a success, they must reroll their save and take the
      second result. If the spell targets more than one creature, you may only
      force one of them to re-roll.</p>
