      <p>You can use an action to shine the light of freedom so brightly that
      none can escape it. For one minute, you emit bright light to 100 feet and
      dim light for 100 feet beyond that. All creatures in the radius of your
      bright light are under a continuous <em>freedom of movement</em> effect
      and are immune to the stunned and petrified conditions, and if either of
      these conditions are present they immediately end. All restraints and
      imprisoning structures (even magical ones) in the area of your bright
      light immediately spring open. If a creature is blinded, deafened,
      paralyzed, or missing limbs (whether by injury or birth), those
      afflictions are immediately healed as if by a <em>regenerate</em> spell
      unless the creature does not wish for them to be. At the Narrator's
      discretion, other afflictions such as chronic pain, cancer, and so on are
      also healed.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again
      until you finish a long rest.</p>
