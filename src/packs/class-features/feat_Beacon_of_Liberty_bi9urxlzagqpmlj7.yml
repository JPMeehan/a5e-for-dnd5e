      feet beyond that. All creatures in the radius of your bright light are
      under a continuous
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.adbxdvi3uj851e70]{Freedom of
      Movement} effect and are immune to the stunned and petrified conditions,
      and if either of these conditions are present they immediately end. All
      restraints and imprisoning structures (even magical ones) in the area of
      your bright light immediately spring open. If a creature is blinded,
      deafened, paralyzed, or missing limbs (whether by injury or birth), those
      afflictions are immediately healed as if by a regenerate spell unless the
      creature does not wish for them to be. At the Narrator's discretion, other
      afflictions such as chronic pain, cancer, and so on are also healed.</p>
