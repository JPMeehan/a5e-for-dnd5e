      <p>Your smite instead deals fire damage, and the target must make a
      Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take 1d6
      fire damage. On a successful save, it takes no damage and the fire is
      extinguished. The fire can also be put out as an action or by the
      environment, and extinguishes itself after 1 minute.</p>
