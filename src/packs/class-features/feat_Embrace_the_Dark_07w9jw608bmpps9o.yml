      <p>Beginning at 7th level, you can enshroud yourself in darkness. As an
      action, you can activate your shroud of darkness. Your shroud remains
      active for 1 hour, until you fall&nbsp;unconscious</span>, or until you
      use a bonus action to deactivate it. While your shroud is active, light
      within 30 feet decreases from&nbsp;bright light to dim light, from dim
      light to darkness, or from darkness to magical darkness. You can use this
      feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all
      uses when you finish a&nbsp;<span>long rest.</p>
