      <p>Also beginning at 3rd level, you gain a Breath Weapon as a dragonborn
      of your level. If you already have a Breath Weapon, you may use it an
      additional time between rests. While you are raging, your Breath Weapon
      deals an additional die of damage, and you may choose freely between the
      line and cone variants.</p>
