      <p>Your time fighting against otherworldly threats has made you especially
      adept at defending against their attempts to harm you.&nbsp;When you are
      attacked by an aberration, celestial, fey, fiend, or undead, you may use
      your reaction to increase your AC by 3, potentially canceling the
      attack.</p><p>You may also, as an action, create an extraplanar exclusion
      zone that extends out to 15 feet around yourself. While the zone is
      active, aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, and undead must make a
      Wisdom save (DC equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency
      bonus) to enter the zone. If a creature is already within the zone, it
      must make the same save to stay in it, but need not move further away once
      it has exited. The zone lasts for 10 minutes. Once you have used this
      feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
