      traffic in courts both otherworldly and mortal. Choose one invocation from
      the following list: Beguiling Influence, Courts of the Outer Realms, Eyes
      of the Runekeeper, Gaze of Two Minds, Mask of Many Faces, Ominous
      Tormentor, Psionic Secrecy, Spellbinding Contract, Voice of the Chain
      Master, Whispers of the Grave.</p><p>You gain another bonus invocation in
      this way at 10th level and again at 16th level. When you gain a level in
      this class, you can choose one of the bonus invocations you know and
      replace it with another bonus invocation from this list that you could
      learn at that level.</p>
