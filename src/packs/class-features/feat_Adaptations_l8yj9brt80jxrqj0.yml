      dir="ltr">You quickly adapt to your elemental power, developing your own
      style and method to manifest it.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 2nd level, choose an adaptation. You must meet its
      prerequisites. You gain additional elemental adaptations as you gain
      levels, as shown in the adaptations column of table: &ldquo;the
      elementalist&rdquo;. Your elemental adaptation options are detailed at the
      end of the class description.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
      choose one of the adaptations you know and replace it with another
      adaptation that you could learn at that level.</p>
