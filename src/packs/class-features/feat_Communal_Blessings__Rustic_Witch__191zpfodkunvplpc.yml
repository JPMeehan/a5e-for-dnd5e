      <p>You are adept at bestowing blessings that benefit your community. At
      6th level, you add the plant growth spell to your spell list: it counts as
      a witch spell for you, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&rsquo;t
      count against your number of prepared spells. Furthermore, when using the
      enlarged option, the radius of area you can effect is increased to a
      number of miles equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. You
      may also cast this spell when performing the hunt and gather activity to
      gather twice as much supply as normal.</p><p>In addition, whenever you
      perform a ceremony using the ceremony spell you may choose a number of
      creatures other than yourself equal to your spellcasting ability modifier
      that witness the ceremony. These creatures gain inspiration. A
      purification ceremony must actually end a disease or possession effect to
      grant inspiration in this manner, and a particular creature may be
      inspired this way no more than once per week.</p>
