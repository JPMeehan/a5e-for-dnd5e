      <p>Word spreads of your prodigious strength or how terrifying you can be
      in battle. Whenever you are in a settlement, at least one commoner
      approaches you with a modest gift or bribe and beseeches you to help
      settle a feud, move a large obstacle, or otherwise make use of your
      impressive might. In addition to their offering, they are eager to tell
      you about their home and neighbors</p>
