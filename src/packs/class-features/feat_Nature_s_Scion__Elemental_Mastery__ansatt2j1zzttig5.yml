      <p>At 20th level, you are a master of yourself and your natural
      surroundings. You become extremely familiar with all types of terrain and
      can use the Master Tracker exploration knack at will.</p><p>In addition,
      you learn Primordial if you don’t already know it and gain one of the
      following:</p><h3><strong>ELEMENTAL MASTERY</strong></h3><p>By focusing on
      a specific natural element within 100 feet (air, fire, earth, water, or
      wood) you can attract similar essences to you. After 10 minutes of
      concentration, a creature of that element is drawn to your presence and
      becomes your loyal companion. This creature uses the wilderness guardian
      template with certain traits determined by its type. The creature is
      friendly to you and your companions, takes its turn immediately after
      yours, and obeys your verbal commands. The creature disappears after 1
      hour, when it is reduced to 0 hit points, or you use a bonus action to
      dismiss it. Once you have used this feature, you can’t do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Elemental Mastery Wilderness

      Template</strong></p><p>A wilderness guardian keeps the statistics of its
      base creature, except as follows:</p><p><strong>Armor Class.</strong> The
      guardian’s Armor Class increases by 2.</p><p><strong>Challenge.</strong>
      The guardian’s challenge rating increases to CR
      7.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> The guardian speaks Primordial
      in addition to any other languages it knows.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New
      Trait:&nbsp; Primal Force.</strong> The guardian gains +1 bonus to hit
      with its weapon attacks, dealing an additional 5 points of force damage on
      a hit.</p><p><strong>Multiattack. </strong>If both attacks hit a Medium or
      smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the guardian
      uses its Engulf on it.</p><p><strong>New Action: Engulf. </strong>The
      guardian engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed
      creature is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and at the start
      of each of the guardian’s turns it makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
      or takes 2d8+4&nbsp;bludgeoning damage (or fire damage for a fire
      guardian). If the guardian moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. The
      guardian can have only one creature engulfed at a
      time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Action: Guard Life.</strong> The guardian
      uses its Engulf on a willing or unconscious ally without dealing damage.
      While engulfed, the ally is grappled but not restrained, can see and
      breathe normally, and has total cover. As soon as the ally takes an
      action, reaction, or bonus action, they are no longer engulfed. The
      guardian can release the ally at will (no action required).</p><hr
