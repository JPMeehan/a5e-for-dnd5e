      <p>You become much more formidable than your unassuming appearance would
      suggest. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>Improvised weapons you wield do 1d12 of base damage, but can only be
      used for 4 successful attacks before they break and become useless.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-maneuvers.Item.b2vpnjt7cmqngkjd]{Catch Your
      Breath} maneuver, which does not count against your maneuvers known.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>If you are not being observed and have a disguise kit, you can change
      your appearance as a bonus action, by quickly changing clothing, throwing
      on a wig, or making some other fast, non-magical alteration to your
      appearance, imposing disadvantage on checks to recognize you based on your
      previous appearance.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>Once per turn, you can deal extra weapon damage when you hit a creature
      with a weapon attack, dealing an extra 2d8 points of damage. In order to
      apply this damage, you must not have disadvantage on the attack and your
      target must be within 5 feet of another enemy of the target who is not
      incapacitated. Alternatively, you can apply this additional damage if you
      have advantage on the attack.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>
