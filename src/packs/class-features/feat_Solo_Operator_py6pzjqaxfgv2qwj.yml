      <p>You become much more formidable than your unassuming appearance would
      suggest. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Improvised weapons
      you wield do 1d12 of base damage, but can only be used for 4 successful
      attacks before they break and become useless.</p></li><li><p>You learn the
      <em>Catch Your Breath</em> maneuver, which does not count against your
      maneuvers known.</p></li><li><p>If you are not being observed and have a
      disguise kit, you can change your appearance as a bonus action, by quickly
      changing clothing, throwing on a wig, or making some other fast,
      non-magical alteration to your appearance, imposing disadvantage on checks
      to recognize you based on your previous appearance.</p></li><li><p>Once
      per turn, you can deal extra weapon damage when you hit a creature with a
      weapon attack, dealing an extra 2d8 points of damage. In order to apply
      this damage, you must not have disadvantage on the attack and your target
      must be within 5 feet of another enemy of the target who is not
      incapacitated. Alternatively, you can apply this additional damage if you
      have advantage on the attack.</p></li></ul>
