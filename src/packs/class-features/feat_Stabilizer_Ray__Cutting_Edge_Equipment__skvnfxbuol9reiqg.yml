      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The automaton gains 3 charges which stack
      with the ones from Autonomous Medic and Antitoxin Module (if applicable).
      As an action on its turn, the automaton can spend a charge to
      automatically stabilize a creature making death saves within 30 feet of
      it. It regains all spent charges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
