      <p>Beginning at 6th level, your storm magic becomes more difficult for
      creatures to endure. You may choose to deal half the lightning damage done
      by your spells as radiant damage. In the same way, you may choose to deal
      half a spell’s cold damage as necrotic, and half a spell’s thunder damage
      as force.</p>
