      <p>There are many creatures normally regarded as unnatural, but in your
      heart these creatures still have a right to exist and a place within the
      natural world. You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks
      regarding monstrosities and may treat non-sentient monstrosities as if
      they were beasts for the purposes of Animal Handling. In addition, spells
      and features that allow you to communicate with beasts apply to
      monstrosities as well.</p>
