      <p>At 13th level, your artifact&rsquo;s strength has been unleashed either
      through careful study and discovery or by attaining a deeper bond through
      trust and practice. You gain benefits determined by your bonded
      artifact&rsquo;s form:</p>

      <h2>Weapon of Power Incarnate</h2>

      <p>Whenever you deal damage with your weapon of power you roll an
      additional damage die. (For example a longsword weapon of power would deal
      2d8 slashing damage instead of 1d8 slashing damage.)</p>

      <h2>Armor of Power Incarnate</h2>

      <p>While wearing your armor of power you gain resistance to non-magical
      bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>

      <h2>Font of Power Incarnate</h2>

      <p>The number of extra artifact charges gained from your font of power
      increases to twice your proficiency bonus.</p>
