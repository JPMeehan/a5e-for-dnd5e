      <p>At 18th level, when you use Bloody Prophecy, you can choose a creature
      you can see. It has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, you have
      advantage on saving throws against spells and effects from that creature,
      and your prophecy die is always a d12 against it. The prophecy die
      increases and decreases as normal against other creatures.</p><p>Once you
      use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it
      again.</p>
