      <p>At 7th level, you learn to humiliate your foes even as you strike them
      down. Once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack, choose one
      damage type from fire, lightning, radiant, or thunder. The attack deals
      1d6 bonus damage of the chosen type.&nbsp; The target of the attack must
      also make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC; on a
      failure, it is rattled until the end of its next turn.</p>
