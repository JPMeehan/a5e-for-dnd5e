      <p>You have a way of really seeing folk’s inner character. When you
      succeed on a contested Insight check, if the opposing creature’s Charisma
      score is equal to or less than your spell save DC, for the next 24 hours
      you do not need to make any further checks to recognize whenever that
      creature is lying, telling the truth, or excluding information.</p>
