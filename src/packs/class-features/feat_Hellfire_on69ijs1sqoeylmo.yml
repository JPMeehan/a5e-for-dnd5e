      <p dir="ltr">When you deal fire damage or necrotic damage, at your option
      you can have that damage dealt be half fire damage and half necrotic
      damage.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you may have your flames burn away the life
      essence of creatures. When you deal fire damage to a creature, you can use
      this feature (no action required) to decrease the creature&rsquo;s maximum
      hit points by an amount equal to the fire damage it dealt. You can use
      this feature a number of times per day equal to half your proficiency
      bonus, and you regain all uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>
