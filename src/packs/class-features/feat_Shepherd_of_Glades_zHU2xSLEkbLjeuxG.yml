      <p>You feel at home in the woodland and even in the darkest forest you
      know the safest pastures and calmest glades in which to rest your head.
      When you take the scout journey activity while traveling through
      grasslands, hills, forests, or jungles, on a success or critical success
      you additionally locate a safe glade. Safe glades you find in this way
      count as havens. You may only use this ability once per region, but you
      can always relocate safe glades you have found in the past.</p>
