      <p>Your relic does not quite belong to this world and it can slip in and
      out of it easily. You add the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ijh0tu0wgpsp7v6n]{Misty Step}
      to your list of known wielder spells. In addition, the artifact charge
      cost for you to cast the spell <em>misty step</em> is reduced by 1
      (minimum 1).</p>
