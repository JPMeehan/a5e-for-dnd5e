      <h2>Stand Firm</h2>

      would make a saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a
      success, that ally can choose to make the saving throw with disadvantage.
      If they do and the saving throw succeeds, the ally takes no damage
      instead.</p>

      <h2>Stand Strong</h2>

      <p>While you are conscious, when an ally within your Commanding Presence
      is hit by a melee weapon attack, they can use their reaction to make a
      melee weapon attack against the creature that attacked them.</p>
