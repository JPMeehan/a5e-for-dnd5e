      <p>At 14th level, your Spore Cloud becomes much more potent. Its radius
      increases to 30 feet. Creatures that fail their save against the Spore
      Cloud take 2d4 necrotic damage and have their maximum hit points reduced
      by the same amount in addition to the other effects. Creatures that
      succeed on their save still take the damage but do not suffer the
      reduction to their hit point maximum. The cloud also lightly obscures
      everything inside it, though you can see through it as if it werenâ€™t
      there. Creatures suffering from the hallucinations from the cloud treat
      this as heavily obscured instead. Finally, if a creature fails its save by
      5 or more, it is also confused for one minute.</p>
