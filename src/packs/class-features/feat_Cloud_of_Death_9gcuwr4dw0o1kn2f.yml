      <p>At 14th level, your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.5rc2abg8pu3zly8i]{Spore
      Cloud} becomes much more potent. Its radius increases to 30 feet.
      Creatures that fail their save against the Spore Cloud take 2d4 necrotic
      damage and have their maximum hit points reduced by the same amount in
      addition to the other effects. Creatures that succeed on their save still
      take the damage but do not suffer the reduction to their hit point
      maximum. The cloud also lightly obscures everything inside it, though you
      can see through it as if it weren&rsquo;t there. Creatures suffering from
      the hallucinations from the cloud treat this as heavily obscured instead.
      Finally, if a creature fails its save by 5 or more, it is also confused
      for one minute.</p>
