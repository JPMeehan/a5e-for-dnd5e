      <p>At level 11, your training hunting down dangerous and unique quarry has
      caused you to develop targeted defenses against their abilities. Choose
      one of the following.</p>

      <h2>Evasion</h2>

      <p>When you make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals
      half damage on a success, you take no damage on a success and half damage
      on a failure.</p>

      <h2>Adaptive Defense</h2>

      <p>You have an expertise die on saving throws to avoid or escape being
      grappled, restrained, or knocked prone. In addition, the first time since
      the start of your turn that you are hit by an attack, you gain a +3 bonus
      to AC against any further attacks from that specific creature until the
      start of your next turn.</p>

      <h2>Innured Constitution</h2>

      <p>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. This has
      also bolstered your general constitution, granting an expertise die on all
      saving throws against disease.</p>
