      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you may interject to prevent harm to your
      allies. When an ally within 30 feet of you is hit with an attack that
      deals nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you may use
      your reaction to halve the damage. At 8th level, you may negate all of the
      attack’s damage.</p><p>Once you have used this feature a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
