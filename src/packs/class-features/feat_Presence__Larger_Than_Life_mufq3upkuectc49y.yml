      <p>Your power tends to distort people’s perception of you, causing you to
      seem more dangerous than you are. You have advantage on Intimidation
      checks made to threaten someone with your magic. On a failure, your target
      is unconvinced and unless you make good on your threat with an unambiguous
      show of force to prove your mettle, this feature no longer functions until
      you prove your reputation again. Additionally, features and traits that
      attempt to evaluate how tough you are, such as the fighter’s Size Up,
      always give the impression that you are more dangerous than you actually
      are.</p>
