      <p>The mere sight of you fighting is enough to spur allies on. An allied
      creature inside the range of your <em>Commanding Presence</em> who can see
      you engaged in combat may spend a bonus action to immediately end one of
      the following conditions on themselves: <em>confused</em>,
      <em>frightened</em>, <em>incapacitated</em>, <em>poisoned</em>, or
      <em>rattled</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also use your Rallying Surge feature
      a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus between rests, and your
      <em>Spur Ally</em> feature a number of times equal to half your
      proficiency bonus between rests.</p>
