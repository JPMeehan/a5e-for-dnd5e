    value: >-
      <p dir="ltr">You cause a creature to add an expertise die to its Armor
      Class against every attack for the next minute. During this time all of
      the creature&rsquo;s movement speeds are reduced to 0 and the creature may
      not willingly move. The target creature gains the ability to Trip as a
      reaction when another creature enters or tries to leave its threatened
      area, but it must use its reaction to trip the first creature that
      triggers this effect.</p>
