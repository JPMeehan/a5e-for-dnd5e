      <p>At 20th level, youâ€™re clever enough to accomplish anything. Whenever
      you complete a long rest, choose an effect that could be accomplished by a
      spell of level 8 or lower. You can have that effect occur immediately, or
      keep it in reserve for the day, and cause it to occur at any point by
      spending an action. This can be because you acquired a magic item or
      spellcaster willing to perform the magic, or have a device or hirelings
      capable of matching the feat.</p>
