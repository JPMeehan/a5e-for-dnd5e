      <p>You can use an action to unleash your Eldritch Blast against creatures
      within a 20-foot diameter cube originating at a point within 60 feet. Each
      creature in the area makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking force damage
      equal to 1d10 &times; your proficiency bonus on a failure, or half damage
      on a success.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again
      until you finish a short or long rest. You also regain the use of this
      feature after you&rsquo;ve spent 5 spell points to cast a spell or use
      other features.</p>
