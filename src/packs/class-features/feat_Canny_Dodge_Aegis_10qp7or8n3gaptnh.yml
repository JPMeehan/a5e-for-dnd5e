      <p>When an attack would hit you, you can use your reaction to roll [[/r
      1d4]] and add it to your AC against that attack. Alternately, when you
      would fail a Dexterity saving throw , you can use your reaction to roll
      1d4 and add it to your saving throw. In either case, you know how much the
      roll succeeded or failed by before deciding whether to use this aegis.</p>
