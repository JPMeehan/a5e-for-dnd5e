      <p>At 7th level, you learn to infuse your shots with magic for a variety
      of useful effects. Choose three of the following special shots to learn.
      As a bonus action, you may place any of the following effects on a single
      piece of ammunition such as an arrow, bullet, crossbow bolt, throwing
      knife, sling bullet, or blowgun dart. Any given piece of ammunition can
      only have one such effect on it at a time, and the effect persists until
      you fire the ammunition, use this ability again, or finish a short or long
      rest. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your
      Intelligence modifier (minimum once) you can’t do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p><ul><li><p>Seeking Shot: Choose a target
      whose location you are aware of. When fired, the shot seeks that target
      out, curving around obstacles to strike the target. This shot ignores half
      and three-quarters cover and treats full cover as half cover as long as
      the target isn’t entirely enclosed.</p></li><li><p>Gelid Shot: The
      ammunition is sheathed in an aura of icy magical cold. Upon impact, it
      deals a number of d8s of cold damage equal to half your proficiency
      modifier to the target. It also freezes liquid solid in a radius equal to
      5 feet x your Proficiency bonus (including any potions the target is
      carrying, rendering them unusable until thawed). The supernatural cold
      infuses the solidified liquid for one minute, then it begins thawing
      normally.</p></li><li><p>Shard Blast: When you fire the ammunition,
      instead of making a weapon attack as normal, instead the ammunition
      explodes into a cone of lethal shards. Creatures in a 15-foot cone must
      make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC. Creatures that fail take
      piercing damage equal to the base damage of the weapon + a number of d6s
      of damage equal to half your proficiency bonus and are rattled. Creatures
      that save successfully take half damage and are not
      rattled.</p></li><li><p>Stunning Shot: The ammunition reverberates with
      sonic energy. Upon impact, a creature struck by the ammunition takes
      normal damage + 1d8 thunder damage and must make a Constitution saving
      throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails is stunned until
      the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is deafened until the
      end of its next turn, but is not stunned. The impact of this ammunition
      (hit or miss) can be heard up to 300 feet away.</p></li><li><p>Entangling
      Shot: When this ammunition impacts its target, the target takes weapon
      damage as normal and must make a Strength save against your spell save DC.
      A creature that fails is grappled for one minute. The escape DC is equal
      to your spell save DC. A creature that succeeds is not
      grappled.</p></li><li><p>Terrifying Shot: When fired, this ammunition
      emits an unearthly, baleful shriek audible up to 300 feet away which
      chills the blood of those close to you. Creatures other than you within 30
      feet of you when you fire the ammunition who are not deafened must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you for
      one minute. An affected creature may repeat the save at the end of each of
      its turn, ending the effect on a success. Once a creature has succeeded on
      a save against your Terrifying Shot, it is immune to its effects for 24
      hours.</p></li><li><p>Incinerating Shot: The ammunition ignites any
      unattended flammable objects within 5 feet of its path to its target and
      deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. The target must make a
      Dexterity save against your spell save DC or catch fire, taking 1d6
      ongoing fire damage every round for a minute or until an action is spent
      to extinguish the flames.</p></li><li><p>Accelerated Shot: The ammunition
      is infused with magical speed. When you fire this ammunition, treat the
      short and long ranges as though their values were doubled for the purposes
      of calculating its range, you gain an expertise die on the attack, and the
      shot deals an additional d4 of damage.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>
