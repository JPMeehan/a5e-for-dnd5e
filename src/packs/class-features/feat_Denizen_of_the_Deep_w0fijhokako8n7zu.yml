      <p dir="ltr">You are at one with the water. You are able to walk on water
      as if it were land, though choppy water counts as difficult terrain. Your
      swim speed increases to twice your Speed, and moving in running water
      imposes no penalty upon you. You take no penalties for attacking
      underwater either.</p>
