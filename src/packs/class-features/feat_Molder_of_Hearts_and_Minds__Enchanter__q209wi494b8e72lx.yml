      <p>You always have the <em>dominate person</em> and <em>mass
      suggestion</em> spells prepared and they don't count against your number
      of prepared spells. You may cast one of these spells at their lowest spell
      level without expending a spell slot. Once you have cast a spell this way,
      you cannot cast either spell in this manner until you finish a long
      rest.</p><p>You also learn the rare spells <em>Gorana's Inveigling Charm
      Person</em> and <em>Gorana's Inveigling Charm Monster</em> without needing
      to research them.</p>
