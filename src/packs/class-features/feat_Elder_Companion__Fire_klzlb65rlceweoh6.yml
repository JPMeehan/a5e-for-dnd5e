      dir="ltr">As you grow in power, so does your elemental companion.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">At 11th level, your elemental companion grows to large size,
      though you can reduce it to medium or small or back again to large as an
      action. It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to
      d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are
      able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its
      Elder ability, shown below.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Fire, Wildfire:</strong> Your elemental companion
      moves up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. It can
      enter the spaces of hostile creatures, but not end its movement there.
      When a creature shares its space with the elemental for the first time
      during this movement, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw against
      your spell save DC. On a failure, it takes your fire blast damage, or half
      damage on a success.</p>
