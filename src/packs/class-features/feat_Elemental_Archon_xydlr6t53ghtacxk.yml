      <p dir="ltr">At 20th level, you epitomize how the element you&rsquo;ve
      studied is the embodiment of your ideology. As an action, you can wreathe
      yourself in your element. This elemental wreath lasts for 1 minute. It
      extends in a 10-foot radius, emanates bright light in a 25-foot radius,
      and dim light 25 feet beyond that. Whenever a creature starts its turn in
      the elemental wreath or enters it for the first time this turn, the
      creature takes 20 damage of the same type as your element.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, for the duration, you have immunity to your
      element, and resistance to the other two.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
