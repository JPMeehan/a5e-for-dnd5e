      <p>Also at 10th level, you can more easily secure passage into and out of
      the afterlife. A creature casting a spell to return you to life such as
      (raise dead or reincarnate) does not need material components to do so. In
      addition, you may die as an action. Whenever you die (via this ability or
      by any other means), your soul is instantly set on the path to whatever
      final afterlife it is destined for and cannot be trapped or destroyed.
      Your body is on its own, however.</p>
