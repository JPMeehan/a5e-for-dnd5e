      <p>At 18th level, you can hit miniscule targets at ludicrous ranges with
      seemingly impossible accuracy. Whenever you take the Attack action and are
      able to make multiple ranged attacks, you may forgo all of those ranged
      attacks except for one to turn that remaining attack into a Critical Shot,
      making a ranged weapon attack with advantage. If your Critical Shot hits
      it becomes a critical hit.</p>
