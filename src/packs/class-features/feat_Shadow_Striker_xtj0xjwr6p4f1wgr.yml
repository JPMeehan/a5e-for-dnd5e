      <p>At 7th level, you become especially adept at striking from ambush and
      stealth. When you have advantage on an attack due to an enemy not being
      able to perceive you due to cover, stealth, invisibility or similar
      circumstances you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
      </p>
