      <p>At level 14, the sight of you is enough to make fortification engineers
      despair. Your spells deal double damage to objects and
      structures.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Also, when you take the Attack action, you can substitute any number of
      your attacks with a cantrip of the <em>weaponry </em>school. When you cast
      two or more cantrips in the same Attack action,&nbsp; you cannot cast any
      more spells until the end of your turn. You cannot use this feature if you
      already cast a spell this turn.</p>
