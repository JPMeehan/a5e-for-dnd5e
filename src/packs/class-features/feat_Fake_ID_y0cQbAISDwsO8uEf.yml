      <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-a93af0fd-7fff-aabe-b8cd-8ef811cc13cd">You
      gain proficiency with checks using a forgery kit. If you are already
      proficient with checks using a forgery kit, you instead gain an expertise
      die. In addition, you have numerous false pieces of identification (a mix
      of real and fictional identities). You can present your fake
      identification to make a prestige check (using your normal prestige value)
      to convince someone you are one of these fake identities in order to gain
      an audience or call in a favor. You may add your expertise die (if any) on
      checks using forgery kits to this roll. Anyone who is suspicious of your
      identification can attempt to detect the forgery by making an
      Investigation check with a DC equal to your passive check using a forgery
      kit (10 + proficiency + your Dexterity modifier + 3 if you have an
      expertise die). </span></p>
