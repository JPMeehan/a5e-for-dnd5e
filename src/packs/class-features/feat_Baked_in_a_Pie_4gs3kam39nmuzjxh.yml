      dir="ltr">At 6th level, you have gained the skill to fuse your spells into
      food, granting its effects to whomever consumes it. You may cast a witch
      spell that would target a creature into a food item or a beverage, and any
      creature who consumes that item experiences the effects of the spell as if
      it had been cast on them (consuming the food requires an action). If a
      spell would require concentration, the creature who consumed the item
      rolls any checks to maintain concentration, but they use your spellcasting
      save DC and spellcasting ability modifier to calculate spell attacks and
      damage rolls. You may only create one of these foodstuffs at a time, and
      if you create another item in this fashion the effects of the first spell
      immediately end.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Additionally, if you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or
      higher, you may create a blackbird pie, as in the wondrous item. Once you
      conjure forth a blackbird pie in this fashion, you may not do so again
      until you complete a long rest.</p>
