      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Witches have an
      unparalleled mastery of ritual magic. A 9th level, you can cast any witch
      spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In
      addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the
      following abilities.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Book of
      Dreams</strong></s></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Coven
      Casting</strong></s></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Ritual
      Attire</strong></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Choose one of the
      following types of attire: wearing clothing entirely of a single colour
      (clothes that are stained, muddied, bloodied, or otherwise dirty in ways
      that break this single colour scheme prevent this ability from
      functioning, as does weaing anything of a different colour), multiple
      pieces of jewelry made of a specific material and containing specific
      designs (total value worth at least 1000 gold and must be custom made), or
      being skyclad.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">When wearing this
      specific attire, ritually casting a spell only increases the cast time by
      1 minute, and you may ritually cast two spells you have access to at once,
      provided they have the same casting time. This benefit only applies to
      spells that you ritually cast on your own.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><s><strong>Candle
      Magic</strong></s></p>
