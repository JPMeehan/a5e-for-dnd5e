      <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain advantage on checks made to avoid being
      knocked prone. In addition, when a creature you can see attacks a target
      other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
      impose disadvantage on the attack roll if you are wearing heavy armor.</p>
