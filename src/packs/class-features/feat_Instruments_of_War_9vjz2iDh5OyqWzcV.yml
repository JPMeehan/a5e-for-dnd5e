      <p>You gain proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice. You
      can use a musical instrument you are proficient with to send signals and
      communicate information to your allies up to one mile away, allowing you
      to convey basic concepts and emotions, such as &ldquo;enemies on the
      move&rdquo;, &ldquo;rally to me&rdquo; and &ldquo;the situation is
      lost&rdquo;. Your allies automatically understand the meaning you&rsquo;re
      trying to convey. When you hear similar calls and alarms from others, you
      always understand the meaning of the call, regardless if they are your
      allies or not.</p>
