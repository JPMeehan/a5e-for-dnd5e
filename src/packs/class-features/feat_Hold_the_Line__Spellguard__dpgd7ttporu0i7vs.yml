      <p>Also at level 10, you can draw on additional reserves of magic when you
      need them most. When you become bloodied, you may use your reaction to
      immediately recover spell slots as though you had just used your
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.iqlgotutphoratct]{Arcane
      Recovery}. Additionally, until you begin your next long rest, any
      abjuration spells you cast using a spell slot behave as though they were
      up-cast using a spell slot of one spell-level higher (maximum 9th-level)
      than the one actually used.</p>

      <p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you
      complete a long rest. Using this feature does not consume your use of
      Arcane Recovery.</p>
