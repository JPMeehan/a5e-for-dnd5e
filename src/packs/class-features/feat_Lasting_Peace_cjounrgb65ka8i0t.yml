      dir="ltr">At 14th level, you gain resistance to psychic damage. If you
      grant a creature a bardic inspiration die, it gains resistance to psychic
      damage until the die is spent or lost.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you learn the greater restoration spell, or
      another bard spell if you already know it. You may expend a use of bardic
      inspiration in place of the material component required by the spell.</p>
