      <p>At 15th level, your example compels even the wicked. As an action, or
      as a reaction when you become bloodied, you can open the eyes of every
      creature within 30 feet of you to their own moral failings. The effect
      ends after one hour if you are not bloodied. If you are bloodied, it ends
      as soon as you receive sufficient healing to no longer be bloodied or
      after an hour, whichever comes first. Creatures subject to this effect see
      the full extent of their own sin without the shield of their own
      justifications or excuses. Creatures with the Atonement destiny are immune
      to the effects of this feature, as are Celestials and Aberrations. Fiends,
      Undead, and creatures with the Monster destiny save automatically, but
      still suffer the reduced effects. </p><p>All other creatures with an
      Intelligence of 5 or greater that enter the area or start their turn in
      the area of this effect must make a Wisdom save against your spell save
      DC. A creature that fails its save is knocked prone and stunned, and at
      the Narrator’s option, may act in a manner that indicates its profound
      guilt as a result of this newfound clarity, such as sobbing or confessing
      its sins. It remains prone and stunned until it takes any damage, has to
      make another saving throw, or until you move further than 30 feet away
      from it. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw take 4d4 psychic
      damage and are rattled until the end of their next turn. Once you have
      used this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p><p>You may also speak words of reassurance to an affected
      creature and help it to its feet (requiring an action), at which point the
      effect ends for it.</p>
