      <p>At 15th level, your example compels even the wicked. As an action, or
      as a reaction when you become bloodied, you can open the eyes of every
      creature within 30 feet of you to their own moral failings. The effect
      ends after one hour if you are not bloodied. If you are bloodied, it ends
      as soon as you receive sufficient healing to no longer be bloodied or
      after an hour, whichever comes first. Creatures subject to this effect see
      the full extent of their own sin without the shield of their own
      justifications or excuses. Creatures with the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-destinies.Item.35clu7k24yeabt8b]{Atonement}
      destiny are immune to the effects of this feature, as are Celestials and
      Aberrations. Fiends, Undead, and creatures with the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-destinies.Item.asfn5b75vpx3ws9v]{Monster} destiny
      save automatically, but still suffer the reduced effects.</p>

      <p>All other creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or greater that enter the
      area or start their turn in the area of this effect must make a Wisdom
      save against your spell save DC. A creature that fails its save is knocked
      prone and stunned, and at the Narrator&rsquo;s option, may act in a manner
      that indicates its profound guilt as a result of this newfound clarity,
      such as sobbing or confessing its sins. It remains prone and stunned until
      it takes any damage, has to make another saving throw, or until you move
      further than 30 feet away from it. Creatures that succeed on their saving
      throw take 4d4 psychic damage and are rattled until the end of their next
      turn. Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>You may also speak words of reassurance to an affected creature and
      help it to its feet (requiring an action), at which point the effect ends
      for it.</p>
