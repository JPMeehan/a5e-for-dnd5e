      <p>At 15th level, your training has granted you certain protections
      against magic. Choose one of the following:</p><h2>Mental
      Discipline</h2><p>Your mind is sheltered from intrusion. When you fail an
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can choose to succeed
      instead. You can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><h2>Mystic Mantle</h2><p>Magic layers upon you into a defensive
      ward that you can extend to even protect your allies. You and creatures
      within 10 feet of you have resistance to the damage of
      spells.</p><h2>Superior Countermagic</h2><p>When you make an ability check
      as part of casting counterspell or dispel magic, you add your proficiency
      bonus to the roll.</p><p>In addition, when you cast one of these spells,
      treat the spell slot level of the spell as one level higher than the
      actual slot you spent. The slot you use to cast the spell must still be at
      least 3rd-level.</p>
