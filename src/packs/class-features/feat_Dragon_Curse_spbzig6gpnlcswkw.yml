      <ul>

      <li>When you deal damage against to cursed creature, it takes additional
      1d4 damage of your draconic damage type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at
      10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>

      <li>The cursed creature has disadvantage on saving throws against fear and
      the breath weapons of dragons.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
