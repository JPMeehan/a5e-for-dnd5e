      <p>Your patron conveys to you knowledge of both martial and arcane arts.
      Choose two 1st-degree combat maneuvers from any tradition. You learn these
      maneuvers. You can also use each of these maneuvers once without spending
      exertion, and you regain the use of each when you complete a long rest.
      (If the benefits of the maneuver improve based on the number of exertion
      spent, that value is 0.) You can change your choice of these maneuvers
      whenever you gain a warlock level.</p>
