    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you have learned to weave together your combat prowess,
      flair for the dramatic, and magical acumen. When you take the Attack
      action, you can spend 2 exertion points to substitute one of your attacks
      with a spell with a casting time of 1 Action. When you do, you emit a
      flash of magical energy that jangles the equilibrium of those around you.
      Hostile creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving
      throw against your spell save DC; creatures who fail are poisoned and
      deafened until the end of their next turn.</p>

      <p>You can cast a spell in this way only once per turn.</p>
