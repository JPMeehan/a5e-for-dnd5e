    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to stack the deck in favor of your friends. If a
      creature in your aura of luck makes an attack roll with advantage, or
      against an enemy that is threatened by other creatures, you may add dice
      from your risk pool to the damage of your allyâ€™s attack as a reaction
      after the roll has been made, but before the narrator declares whether the
      attack was a hit or a miss.</p>
