    value: >-
      <p>You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks and may always use
      your spellcasting ability modifier on Intimidation checks. When a creature
      succeeds on a saving throw against a spell you cast that would cause them
      to become frightened or rattled, you may make an Intimidation check
      opposed by their saving throw. On a success, they must reroll their save
      and take the second result. If the spell targets more than one creature,
      you may only force one of them to re-roll.</p>
