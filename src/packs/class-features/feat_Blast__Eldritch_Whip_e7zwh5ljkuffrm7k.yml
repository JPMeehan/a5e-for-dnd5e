  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can use an action to thrash a creature with a scintillating tendril
      of arcane force. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 15
      feet, dealing [[/r 1d6 #force]] force damage on a hit. At the end of your
      turn you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage
      you dealt with Eldritch Whip this turn (minimum 1), which last until the
      end of your next turn. When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Whip and
      you already have temporary hit points, you can end the temporary hit
      points early to gain a bonus to the Eldritch Whipâ€™s damage roll equal to
      half the number of temporary hit points you ended early.</p>
