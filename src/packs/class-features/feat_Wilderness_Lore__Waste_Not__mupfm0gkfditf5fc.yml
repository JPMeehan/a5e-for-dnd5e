      <p>At 12th level, your knowledge of wilderness lore deepens. Choose one of
      the following options:</p><h3><strong>WASTE NOT</strong></h3><p>With 10
      minutes work you can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of a beast,
      dragon, monstrosity, or plant that has a CR of 1 or higher and has died
      within the last hour. If sold to a collector, druid, or other naturalist,
      this notable component is worth an amount of gold equal to 5 × the
      creature’s CR.</p>
