      <p>Beginning at level 18, you learn the most impressive steel blooded
      metamagic of all, shaping your spells into a protective carapace that,
      when broken, bolsters you or punishes your
      enemies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Armoring Spell </strong>-<strong>
      </strong>When you cast a spell, you may spend 4 sorcery points to make it
      an armoring spell. The casting of the spell is suspended part-way through,
      and you gain temporary hit points equal to double the spellâ€™s level. When
      the last of these hit points are lost, the casting of the spell completes
      (requiring no further action). It is at this point you determine the
      targets of the spell, if any. Unless it is impossible, the spell must
      include either you or the source of the triggering damage among its
      targets or area of effect. You may choose to exclude yourself from a spell
      with an area, if desired.</p></li></ul>
