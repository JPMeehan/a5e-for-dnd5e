      <p>When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to make your
      attack a critical hit that deals maximum damage. In addition, if the
      target is a creature, it makes a Constitution saving throw or it is
      reduced to 0 hit points. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you
      finish a rest.</p>
