      <p>You learn to work as a team and protect those around you. You are
      proficient with the Sanguine Knot combat tradition (you may select a
      different tradition if you are already proficient with Sanguine Knot) and
      learn a single first-degree maneuver from it, which does not count against
      your maneuvers known.</p><p>Furthermore, you learn to put yourself in the
      path of incoming attacks. When a creature within 5 feet of you is targeted
      with an attack, you may use your reaction to make that attack target you
      instead.</p><p><br></p>
