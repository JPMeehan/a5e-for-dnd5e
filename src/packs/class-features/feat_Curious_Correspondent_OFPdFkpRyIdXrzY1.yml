      you cast @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find
      Familiar}, the range at which you can communicate with your familiar and
      use its senses instead of your own becomes unlimited. While you are using
      your familiar&rsquo;s senses, you may also speak through them, causing the
      familiar to replicate the sound of your voice exactly.</span></p>
