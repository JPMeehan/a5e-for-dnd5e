      <p>At 11th level, you can read your enemies like a book. You can use a
      bonus action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the
      Maneuver DC of a creature you have spent at least one round observing in
      combat. If you succeed, choose three of the following items to learn about
      the creature: Armor Class, vulnerabilities , resistances , immunities ,
      weakest saving throw , or highest ability score. At the narratorâ€™s
      discretion, you might learn other pertinent details of its combat
      abilities.</p><p>After you use this feature on a creature, you cannot
      attempt it against the same creature until you finish a short or long rest
      .</p>
