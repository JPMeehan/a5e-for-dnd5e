      <p>Beginning at 7th level, you gain a third aura that is active alongside
      your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.xezwxikwrsfkzg4o]{Sacred
      Aura} and has the same range. Choose one of the following options.</p>

      <p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.a9m3vhe9x3tho5o6]{Aura
      of the Champion: Aura of Darkness}</strong> After initiative is rolled,
      when a hostile creature starts its turn in your aura or first enters into
      it on a turn, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of you
      for 1 minute. Once a creature has been frightened by this aura, it is
      immune to the aura&rsquo;s effects for 24 hours.</p>

      <p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.cnwri456q5q5jqet]{Aura
      of the Champion: Aura of Light}</strong> An unconscious ally with 0 hit
      points that starts its turn in your aura automatically succeeds on one
      death saving throw each turn. Once a creature has succeeded on three death
      saving throws while in your aura, it cannot benefit from this effect until
      it has finished a long rest.</p>
