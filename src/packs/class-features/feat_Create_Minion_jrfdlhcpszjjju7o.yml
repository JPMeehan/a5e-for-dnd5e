      <p class="preFade fadeIn">At 2nd level you gain the power to create a
      permanent undead minion for yourself. The minion follows your orders. If
      it is destroyed, or if you choose to dismiss it (which permanently
      destroys the minion) you may create a new minion once you have taken a
      long rest. You may only have one minion at a time, and minions created in
      this way cannot create or summon other creatures themselves.</p>

      <p>To create a minion you must spend one hour performing an unholy ritual.
      At the end of the hour, your minion arrives.</p>

      <p>Your minion may be any non-elite undead creature with a Challenge
      Rating lower than half your wizard level (round down). For example, at 3rd
      level, you can create a CR 1 minion such as a&nbsp;<strong>ghoul</strong>,
      and at 7th level you may create a CR 3 minion, such as
      a&nbsp;<strong>mummy</strong>.</p>
