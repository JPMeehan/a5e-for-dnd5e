      dir="ltr">At 6th level, your journeys yield unexpected fruits. Choose one
      of the following options:</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Devoted Wanderer</strong></p>

      <p dir="ltr">The heavens smile upon your sacrifices. When you take the
      Pray journey activity, critical failures count as failures, failures
      become successes, successes become critical successes, and critical
      successes also grant a point of favor as per the Religious Devotion
      downtime activity. (Points of favor gained in this way are immediately
      lost if you act against the interests or philosophies of the entities you
      connected with using the Pray journey activity.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, you can always choose to use Religion when
      performing the Religious Devotion downtime activity and have advantage on
      checks to do so.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Greater Destination</strong></p>

      <p dir="ltr">You have come to understand your literal travels as a
      reflection of a deeper, spiritual journey that all travel together.
      Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you gains inspiration from their
      destiny&rsquo;s source of inspiration, you gain inspiration as well if you
      do not already have it. Once you have gained inspiration in this way, you
      cannot gain it again from the same creature until you have completed a
      long rest.</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Long-Time Traveler</strong></p>

      <p dir="ltr">Your travels have led you to experience a little bit of
      everything. You score a critical success on ability checks on a roll of
      19&ndash;20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of
      your critical successes, your critical success range increases by 1
      (maximum 17&ndash;20). Whenever you would roll on an Ability Check
      Critical Success table, roll twice and choose one of the results. If both
      rolls are identical, reroll one of them.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Finally, whenever you gain a sign of faith, you may instead
      choose an adventuring trick from the bard class or an exploration knack
      from the ranger class, substituting your cleric level for any level
      prerequisites.</p>
