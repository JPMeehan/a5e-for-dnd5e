      dream of flight and of life, endeavoring to replicate what nature has
      already created and perhaps even to improve upon it. The miracle of flight
      is a difficult magic to unravel, and thopterist workshops are often filled
      with failed whirligigs and scattered balsa wood models. But once they
      crack those equations, the world opens up to them with infinite horizons
      and soon their workshops are abuzz with whirling wings and chittering
      machines. Each new creation refines their designs, and their facsimiles of
      life get harder and harder to distinguish from flesh and blood.</span></p>
