      <p>When you score a critical hit, you can move up to 30 feet. This
      movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the target of your
      attack. In addition, you gain advantage on any ability checks made to jump
      as part of this movement. The effects of this Furious Critical can be
      combined with any other.</p>
