      <p>Also at 11th level, while wielding a glaive, halberd, or pike, you can
      ready and throw a thrown weapon or item (such as a vial of alchemistâ€™s
      fire or a tanglefoot bag) as part of the attack action on your turn. This
      throw is in addition to your normal attacks with the attack action.</p>
