      <p dir="ltr">Starting at 14th level, you have gained greater control over
      your ability to create and control Undead Servants. As such, you may now
      have a single Undead Servant of challenge rating 1 or lower, or two Undead
      Servants of challenge rating 1/4 or lower.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">If you have two Undead Servants, they both share the same
      initiative, and if you choose to use any upgrades, you must upgrade each
      separately (though both can have the same upgrades if you choose).</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You also add the following choices to your list of
      upgrades:</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Flying</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">If you use a spell slot while you have a prepared spell from
      the Movement school, your Undead Servant gains a fly speed equal to 10ft
      per level of the spell slot used. If the undead already has a fly speed,
      instead increase its fly speed by an amount equal to 5ft per level of the
      spell slot used.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Elemental Attacks</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">If you use a spell slot while you have a prepared spell from
      the Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, poison, or Thunder school, your Undead
      Servant deals an additional 1d4 + the spell slot level damage of the type
      associated with the chosen school. You cannot have both Elemental Attacks
      and Necrotic Power active on the same Undead Servant at the same time.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr">Explosive</h3>

      <p dir="ltr">If you use a spell slot while you have Corpse Explosion
      prepared, you can have your Undead Servant explode in a shower of bone and
      poison when it is reduced to 0 hit points, or if you use a bonus action to
      activate this feature.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">When your Undead Servant explodes, each creature in a 10-foot
      radius of it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d6
      piercing and 2d6 poison damage, and is poisoned for 1 minute on a failed
      save, taking half as much damage and not being poisoned on a successful
      one. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">For each spell slot level above 1st, increase the poison
      damage by 1d6.</p>
