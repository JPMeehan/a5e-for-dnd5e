      <h4>When you cast a spell, rather than have it go off immediately, you can
      spend 6 sorcery points and describe an external condition. When that
      condition occurs before you finish a long rest, you can use your reaction
      to cast the spell. You can only have one Contingent Spell at a time.</h4>
