      <p>When initiative is rolled you can expend one use of Rage to make an
      Intimidation check (DC 8 + number of creatures that rolled initiative) to
      briefly unveil the boundless fury within in a furious roar. On a success
      each creature stops what it is doing and can only make statements and a
      Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check on its turn. On a success by
      5 or more initiative is rerolled, and you choose a number of creatures
      equal to your Constitution modifier to gain advantage on their initiative
      roll.</p>
