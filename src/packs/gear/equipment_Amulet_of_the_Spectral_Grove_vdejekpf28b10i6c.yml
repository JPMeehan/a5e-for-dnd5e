      <p>This intricate piece of jewelry is carved from unblemished white stone.
      A polished opal sits at its center held in place by intricate, delicately
      thin strands of seamless rock. Once you have attuned to this amulet, while
      wearing it you gain the constant effects of a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.wa2nd43b9dvkh1yu]{Protection
      from Evil and Good} spell and you are immune to fear.</p>

      <p>Once per week you can use an action to go limp, withdrawing your spirit
      from your corporeal form (treat your body as under the effects of a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.anlgm314xl6sscco]{Magic Jar} spell).
      Your spectral form appears within 30 feet of your body and gains the
      following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Your AC increases by 3.</li>

      <li>Any damage you take in spectral form is immediately dealt to your
      corporeal form. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, your spectral form
      dissipates. Otherwise your spectral form remains for 2 minutes.</li>

      <li>You gain a fly speed of 40 feet and the ability to hover.</li>

      <li>You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a
      distance of 120 feet.</li>

      <li>You can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when you are on the
      Material Plane, and vice versa.</li>

      <li>You gain resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and
      resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing.</li>

      <li>You gain immunity to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, and the
      charmed, fatigue, grappled , paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone,
      restrained, and slowed conditions.</li>

      <li>You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were
      difficult terrain . You take 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn
      inside an object.</li>

      <li>You can use an action to enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material
      Plane, or vice versa. You are visible on the Material Plane while
      you&rsquo;re in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet you can&rsquo;t
      affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.</li>

      <li>You can use an action to shoot a number of energy rays equal to your
      proficiency bonus. These are spell attacks with range 50/100 ft., and on a
      successful hit deal 3d6 radiant damage plus your Charisma modifier
      (minimum 0). You use Charisma as your spellcasting ability for this
      feature.</li>

      <li>You can use a bonus action to shoot a number of energy rays equal to
      half your proficiency bonus. When you do so, the duration of your spectral
      form is reduced by 1d4 rounds.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>When the duration of your spectral form ends, make a Constitution
      saving throw (DC 8 + 1 per round of use). If your spectral form dissipates
      from damage you have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failure you
      are reduced to 0 hit points and must make death saves.</p>

      <p>Evil and undead creatures take 2d6 fire damage when touching the amulet
      and cannot activate its abilities.</p>
