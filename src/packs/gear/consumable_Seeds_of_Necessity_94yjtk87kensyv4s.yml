      <p><em>Wondrous</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>In the groves of
      particularly friendly and sociable druids the plants themselves become
      helpful and eager to please, their valuable seeds able to grow into
      whatever shape is required.</p><p>A pouch of seeds of necessity contains
      1d10 coin-sized seeds. When you plant one of these seeds in soil and water
      it while you picture in your mind an object which you desire, over the
      course of one minute the seed grows into a simple wooden object no larger
      than a 10-foot-cube that closely matches the picture in your mind (common
      uses include a ladder, a sturdy table, a throne, a barrel, a cart wheel,
      or a rowboat).</p><p>The seed is consumed as it grows into the object. The
      seed cannot grow into an object with moving parts, but several seeds can
      be grown into a combination of objects which could be used to construct a
      more complicated shape, such as a cart made from a tray with four wheels,
      or a row boat and two oars.</p><p>When you plant and water a seed of
      necessity, roll a d100.</p><p>On a result of 100, instead of the object
      you requested, a friendly awakened shrub grows in its place. On a result
      of 13 or less, the seed was a bad seed and instead grows into a hostile
      awakened tree</p>
