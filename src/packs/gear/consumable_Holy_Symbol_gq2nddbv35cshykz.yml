      <p>These foci (often called holy symbols) are representations of a deity,
      pantheon, or ideal. They usually depict the crest or icon of a specific
      god or are of symbolic importance to a particular faith. Reliquaries,
      censers, amulets, emblems, or tattoos are often used as spellcasting foci
      by clerics and heralds.</p>
