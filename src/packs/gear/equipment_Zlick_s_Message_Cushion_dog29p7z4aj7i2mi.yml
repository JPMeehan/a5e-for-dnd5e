      <p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Written joke responsible for at
      least 1 minute of genuine laughter</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>This
      small pink air bladder has a winking wizard emblazoned on the front. As a
      bonus action, you can whisper a phrase up to 10 words long into the
      cushion, which will inflate it. While inflated, any creature that
      accidentally sits on or applies pressure to the cushion deflates it. A
      creature can also use a bonus action to intentionally deflate the cushion.
      When the cushion deflates, it loudly repeats the phrase spoken into it
      along with somewhat humorous flatulence noise. This sound is clearly
      audible to a range of 50 feet.</p><p>Alternatively, you can cast a cantrip
      or spell of 1st-level into the <em>Zlick&rsquo;s message</em> cushion so
      long as the words laughter, mockery, or whisper are in the spell name.
      When the cushion is deflated it casts the spell, targeting the creature
      that deflated it, and afterward it becomes a mundane item.</p>
