    value: >-
      <p>This gauntlet fits over the wrist, binding tightly with cords of
      leather, and one side of it is adorned with a winged silver contraption
      that has a taut wire connected on the ends and set perpendicular to the
      bracer. When you take the Attack action using this weapon, you may choose
      to attack with disadvantage until the start of your next turn to make two
      additional ranged weapon attacks.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>This archaic weapon is covered in holy iconography. You gain a +1
      magical bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this quickbow.</p>

      <p>In addition, while attuned this weapon has the following
      properties.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Rain of Bolts.</strong></em> You can use an action to fire
      a rain of bolts. Make a ranged weapon attack against any number of
      creatures within 40 feet of a point you can see within 100 feet. You must
      have ammunition for each target, and you make a separate attack roll for
      each target. You do not have disadvantage for firing the weapon at long
      range for this action. Once you have used this property, it cannot be used
      again until the next sunrise.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Silvered Bolts.</strong></em> Every bolt you fire from the
      quickbow becomes coated in silver as it leaves the flight groove. On a
      successful hit against an undead, a silvered bolt from this weapon deals
      an extra 1d6 radiant damage. This silver dissipates after 1 minute.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Evil and undead creatures take 2d6 radiant damage when touching this
      weapon and cannot wield it.</p><hr><p><b>Hand-Mounted:</b> This weapon is
      affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a
      ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage on saving throws
      made to resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is wielding a
      hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket, using
      thievesâ€™ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen
      components.</p>
