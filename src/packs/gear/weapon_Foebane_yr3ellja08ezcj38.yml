      <p>This double-sided blade is made of red-hued iron and is engraved with
      Draconic runes that glow an unsettling yellow-greenish light. The hilt is
      made of blackened iron and wrapped with red silver wire, the pommel shaped
      like the head of a red dragon.</p>

      <p>This Pemberton family heirloom was used to slay the dreaded dragon
      Cirothe&mdash;an event prepared for centuries beforehand. The ancient
      enchantments in the blade have come to life, increasing its power and
      making it one of the most powerful weapons in all of Elissar.</p>

      <p>Foebane has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit,
      and one greater artifact detriment.</p>

      <p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using Foebane.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Bane Foes.</strong></em> After you have attuned to this
      greatsword, whenever you finish a long rest you can choose a type of
      creature (aberration, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey,
      fiend, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or undead). Foebane
      becomes baned against the chosen type of creature until you use this
      property to choose a different type of creature or become unattuned to it.
      When you use this greatsword to deal damage against a baned creature you
      deal an extra 3d6 slashing damage, and on a critical hit you deal an extra
      3d10 radiant damage. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws made
      to resist the attacks and traits of baned creatures.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Souleater.</strong></em> A baned creature killed by Foebane
      cannot be restored to life by any means unless it is a legendary creature.
      The first time you use Foebane to kill a baned creature and each time you
      use it to kill a baned creature of a greater challenge rating, it gains a
      foe die. You can expend one or more foe dice when making an attack against
      or ability check to find or track a baned creature, gaining an expertise
      die for each. When you die or become unattuned to Foebane, all of its foe
      dice&nbsp; are lost.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this
      weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can
      gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made
      against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while
      incapacitated , paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
