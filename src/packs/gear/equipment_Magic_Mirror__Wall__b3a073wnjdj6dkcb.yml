      <p>When a magic mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows an
      insubstantial otherworldly face looking back at you. Magic mirrors can be
      found in three sizes.</p>

      <p>While this bulky mirror is securely fastened to a wall, twice per dawn
      you<br>can look into it and speak a command phrase to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.h5ssew7apf5ofbhc]{Commune},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.59she20yqbp2giqq]{Contact Other Plane}, or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.bs3wnsid88tbup6c]{Divination}. Your
      reflection answers your questions. Additionally, as an action once per
      dawn, the wall mirror can be linked to another magic mirror by speaking
      the name of the other mirror&rsquo;s bearer,<br>initiating a face to face
      conversation that can last up to 10 minutes. Both you and the other mirror
      user can clearly see each other&rsquo;s faces, but don&rsquo;t get any
      sense of one another&rsquo;s surroundings. Either you or the other mirror
      user can use a bonus action to end the conversation early. <br><br></p>
