      <p>This ebony navigational instrument points in random directions while
      above the surface. Once you have attuned to it and are at least 100 feet
      underground, the shadow compass points to the nearest S覺f覺rda River. While
      on a S覺f覺rda River in or between Underland seas, you can speak your
      destination to the shadow compass and it points to the right currents to
      follow, reducing your travel time by half.</p>
