      <p>While you are attuned to this magic sword, you can use a bonus action
      and speak its command word to make flames erupt from the blade, shedding
      bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40
      feet.</p><p>While lit, attacks using the sword deal an extra 2d6 fire
      damage.</p><p>The flames last until you use a bonus action to put them out
      or until you drop or sheathe the sword.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When
      you are wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before
      your next turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single
      melee attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use
      this property while incapacitated , paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or
      stunned.</p>
