      <p>While attuned to this magic tome, you gain an&nbsp;expertise
      die</span>&nbsp;to skill checks made to recognize and notice underground
      traps and architectural features. In addition, you gain an expertise die
      on&nbsp;saving throws</span>&nbsp;against traps.</p><p>The book contains
      10 illustrations of doors, 10 illustrations of traps, and 10 illustrations
      of monsters. As an action, you can permanently tear out an illustration
      and place it on a surface to make a real door, trap, or monster appear.
      Once an illustration is used, it can&rsquo;t be used again.</p><p>If you
      place a door, a key that you can use to lock and unlock the door magically
      appears in your hand. Behind the door is a permanent passage through the
      wall. The passage is 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and up to 10 feet deep. The
      passage creates no instability. If you place a trap, you can choose
      between the following traps from this book (chapter 2): acid pit trap,
      commanding voice trap, explosive runes trap, false door trap, hidden pit
      trap (x3), lock trap (x3, can be placed only on a lock).</p><p>If you
      place a monster, the monster is not initially hostile to any creature
      present when it is summoned but is hostile to all other creatures. It
      otherwise acts according to its nature. The following monsters can be
      placed:&nbsp;black pudding</span>,&nbsp;gelatinous cube,&nbsp;<span>hell
      hound,&nbsp;<span>kobold&nbsp;(x3),&nbsp;<span>minotaur, skeleton immortal
      (x3, DDG).</p>
