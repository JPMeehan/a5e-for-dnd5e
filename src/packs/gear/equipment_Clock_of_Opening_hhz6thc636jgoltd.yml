    value: >-
      <p>This grandfather clock weighs 250 pounds and tolls loudly every hour.
      Among its internal mechanisms are 12 keyholes of various sizes. Any key
      can be inserted into a keyhole.</p><p>If you are trained in the Arcana or
      Engineering skill, you can use an action to cause a lock within 500 miles
      to magically lock or unlock by inserting the lock&rsquo;s key into the
      clock and adjusting the clock&rsquo;s mechanisms. Additionally, so long as
      the key remains in the clock, you can schedule the lock to lock or unlock
      at certain hours of the day.</p>
