      <p>This small silver charm resembles a feather. Many types of feather
      tokens exist with different effects.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p>While on a wind-powered vessel, you can use an action to toss
      the token into the air where it transforms into a massive flapping fan or
      palm frond, creating enough wind to power the vessel or increase its speed
      by 5 miles per hour for up to 8 hours.</p><p>When the effect ends, the
      token disappears. You may spend an action to dismiss the fan.</p>
