      <p>Many fledgling wizards find themselves overwhelmed with the workload
      that’s thrust upon them and struggle to find the time for all of their
      duties—between studying, projects, and the many chores often required of
      them it can be difficult to attend lectures. These enchanted trinkets were
      one of the many tools created to alleviate the problem and are now sold to
      more than novice mages. Each resembles a perfectly ordinary writing quill.
      When you spend a bonus action to speak the command word and expend 1
      charge, the quill leaps to life and copies everything said by a target
      that you can hear within 60 feet.</p><p>The quill ceases to copy after 1
      hour, when the target moves more than 60 feet away from it, stops speaking
      for more than 10 minutes, or when it runs out of writing surface (usually
      a long scroll of parchment). The magic that animates the quill can also be
      put to slightly more dangerous purposes. When you speak another command
      word and expend all 3 charges, as an action you hurl it at a target you
      can see within 10 feet. The quill leaps to life and jabs, stabs, pokes,
      gouges, and otherwise injures the target for up to 1 minute. The quill
      attacks once per round at the end of your turn. It has a +2 bonus to
      attack and deals 1d4 piercing damage on a successful hit. When you roll a
      natural 1 to attack with the quill, it loses its magic and becomes a
      mundane item. Otherwise, it falls to the ground when its target has moved
      more than 15 feet away or become incapacitated.</p><p>The quill has 3
      charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.</p>
