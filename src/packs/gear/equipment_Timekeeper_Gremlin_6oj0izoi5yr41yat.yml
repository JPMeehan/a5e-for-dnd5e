      <p>Inside of this iron locket waits a Tiny ethereal green goblinoid
      endlessly counting to itself.</p><p>The magical creature obeys very
      limited instructions but only when they relate to timekeeping.</p><p>It
      counts the seconds, minutes, and hours accurately out loud as they pass,
      immediately losing count when interrupted.</p>
