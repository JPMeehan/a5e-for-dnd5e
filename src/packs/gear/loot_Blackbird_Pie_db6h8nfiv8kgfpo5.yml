      <p>This item appears to be a freshly baked pie in a tin. When the crust is
      fully punctured the pie explodes as 24 magic blackbirds fly out and flit
      through the air in a 20-foot radius for 2d4 rounds, at which point the
      birds and the pie disappear. A creature that starts its turn in the area
      or first enters into the area on its turn makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving
      throw, taking 1 slashing damage on a failure.</p><p>A creature damaged by
      the blackbirds has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until
      the beginning of its next turn. The blackbirds are magical and cannot be
      interacted with like normal animals, and attacking them has no effect.</p>
