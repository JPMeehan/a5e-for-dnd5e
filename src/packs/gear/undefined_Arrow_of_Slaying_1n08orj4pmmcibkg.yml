      <p>A particular kind of creature is chosen when this magic arrow is
      created. When the arrow of slaying damages a creature belonging to the
      chosen type, heritage, or group, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution
      saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or
      half as much extra damage on a successful one. Once the arrow of slaying
      deals its extra damage to a creature, it loses its magical
      properties.</p><p>Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such
      as bolts meant for a crossbow, or bullets for a firearm or sling.</p>
