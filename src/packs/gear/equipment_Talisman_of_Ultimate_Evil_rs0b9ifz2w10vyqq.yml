    value: >-
      <p>This talismanâ€™s blasphemous nature harms creatures that do not have the
      Evil trait, dealing 6d6 necrotic damage when touched (or 8d6 necrotic
      damage to a creature with the Good trait). A creature carrying or holding
      this item takes the same damage at the end of each of its turns as long as
      it does so.</p><p>A cleric or herald with the Evil trait can use this
      talisman as a holy symbol, which grants a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls
      while held or worn.</p><p>In addition, the talisman has 6
      charges.</p><p>While wielded or worn, you can use an action to expend a
      charge and choose a target within 120 feet that is on the ground. If the
      creature has the Good trait, it makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or is
      destroyed by a flaming pit that appears beneath it. Once the pit closes no
      trace of it or the target remains.</p><p>Once all charges are expended,
      the talisman melts into a puddle of ooze.</p>
