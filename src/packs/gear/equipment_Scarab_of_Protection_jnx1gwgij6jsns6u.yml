      <p><em>Wondrous Item</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>After being
      held in your hand for 1 round, this scarab medallion shimmers with magical
      inscriptions. The scarab has 12 charges, crumbling into dust when it has
      no charges left.</p><p>This item has two benefits while it is on your
      person.</p><ul><li><p>First, you gain advantage on saving throws made
      against spells.</p></li><li><p>Second, if you fail a saving throw against
      a necromancy spell or either an attack from or trait of an undead
      creature, you may instead succeed on the saving throw by using your
      reaction to expend a charge from the scarab.</p></li></ul>
