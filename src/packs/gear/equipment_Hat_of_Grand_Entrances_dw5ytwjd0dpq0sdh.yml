      Step into the room and make a grand entrance! This top hat has embroidered
      figurines of trumpet players in full regalia. By speaking a command word,
      you can cause the figures to magically and loudly herald your arrival by
      trumpet blasts, followed by a speech announcing your name, titles, and any
      of your major accomplishments. You can alter this speech beforehand by
      giving any special instructions to the hat

      before speaking the command word. Once this hat

      has heralded an entrance it canâ€™t be used again for

      10 minutes.
