    value: >-
      <p>Marshland gear includes special boots, gloves, and clothes designed to
      repel moisture and muck. This gear can be worn over light armor and takes
      5 minutes to don or remove. While you are wearing marshland gear, you can
      move at a normal pace through nonmagical swamps and marshes, but you have
      disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws made on dry or rocky
      terrain.</p>
