      <p>The autominer consists of a backpack with a small clockwork engine and
      two arms: a control arm and a working arm. The control arm has several
      small buttons and levers and is used to set the operation of the working
      arm.</p>

      <p>The working arm is typically fitted with a mining pick with the breaker
      (stone) property, which deals 2d6 piercing damage on a successful hit. Axe
      variants, which have the breaker (wood) property and deal slashing damage,
      are popular with lumberjacks and adventurers alike.</p>

      <p>To use the autominer, the clockwork engine must first be wound as an
      action either by you or another creature, enabling it to operate for 1
      hour. Then, you must spend an action to target an adjacent square.
      Immediately after, the autominer begins making a single attack per round
      on your turn against whatever is in the square, using an attack bonus of 4
      + your proficiency bonus. Any creature passing through the square is also
      attacked once as if it had provoked an opportunity attack (there is no
      limit to the number of times this can happen). Attacks against creatures,
      including opportunity attacks, are made with disadvantage.</p>

      <p>Once the autominer&rsquo;s target is set, it swings continuously until
      its hour runtime is expended or the kill switch is activated. This happens
      automatically if you use any movement, on account of the autominer&rsquo;s
      safety feature. You can also trigger it manually as a reaction, which can
      prevent the opportunity attack above. Retargeting requires another action.
      While the arm is swinging, you effectively only have the use of one
      hand.</p>
