      you are familiar with on another plane of existence, making a DC 15
      Intelligence check. On a success you cast the plane shift spell, but on a
      failure you and every creature and object within a 15-foot radius are
      transported to a random location determined with a d100 roll. On a 1–60
      you transport to a random location on the plane you named, or on a 61–100
      you are transported to a randomly determined plane of existence
