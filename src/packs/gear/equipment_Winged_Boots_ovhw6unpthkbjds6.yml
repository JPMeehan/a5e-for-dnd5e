      <p>While you are wearing these boots, you have a flying speed equal to
      your Speed and you can hover. You can use these boots to fly for 2 hours,
      expending at least 10 minutes worth of time with each use. If you are
      flying when the time runs out, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round and
      take no damage from landing.</p>

      <p>The boots regain 1 hour of flying time for every 12 hours they are not
      in use. </p>
