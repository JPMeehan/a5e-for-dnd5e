      <p>A convincing way to cover one&rsquo;s tracks is to create the
      appearance that an area hasn&rsquo;t been disturbed in a long time. This
      spindly wooden wand sheds a little dust whenever you touch it. While
      holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to conjure wispy
      cobwebs in a 1-foot cube within 30 feet of you that you can see. The
      cobwebs must be anchored to two solid masses or layered across a floor,
      wall, or ceiling. The ground beneath the cobwebs is covered with a layer
      of dust that suggests at least a year of disuse. The cobwebs and dust last
      until cleared away.</p>

      <p>The wand has 10 charges and regains [[/r 1d6+4 #charges]] charges each
      dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a [[/r 1d20]]. On a result of 5
      or less, the wand disintegrates into a mass of cobwebs. </p>
