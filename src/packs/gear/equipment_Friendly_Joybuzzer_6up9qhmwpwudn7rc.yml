      <p>This tin ring houses a small circular device with a red
      button.</p><p>You have advantage on Sleight of Hand checks made to hide
      the friendly joybuzzer.</p><p>Once you are attuned to this magic item,
      whenever a creature presses the button (even inadvertently through a
      handshake) for the next minute it becomes happier and friendlier towards
      you.</p><p>For the duration, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks
      against the creature.</p><p>If the creature sees the joybuzzer being used
      or recognizes it as a magical item, it immediately realizes that you used
      magic to influence its mood and may become hostile toward
      you.</p><p>Alternatively, once you are attuned to this magic item, while
      you are shaking hands with a creature you can choose to destroy the
      friendly joybuzzer.</p><p>Make a melee spell attack with advantage, using
      your highest mental ability score as your spellcasting ability score. On a
      successful hit, you target the creature as if you had cast shocking grasp,
      treating each damage die as if you had rolled the maximum amount.</p>
