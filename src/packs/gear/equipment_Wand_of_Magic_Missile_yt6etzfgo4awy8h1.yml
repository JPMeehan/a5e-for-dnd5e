      <p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of
      its charges to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.4tslywqpami9q4pj]{Magic Missile}.
      For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. Increase the
      spell slot level by one for each additional expended charge.</p>

      <p>This wand has 7 charges and regains [[/r 1d6+1 #charges]] expended
      charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]].
      On a 1, the wand transforms into a bolt of magic that soars out of sight
      and disappears </p>
