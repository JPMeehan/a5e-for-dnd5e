      <p>This small stone is rumored to once have been an heirloom of a
      prominent family of seers from a mountainous region. The cameo is made of
      stone that features a light gray and cream-colored swirling pattern
      attached to a slender beige lace ribbon to hang about the neck. When you
      are wearing this cameo, you gain an expertise die on saving throws against
      fear.</p><p>Once you have worn the jewelry for 24 hours, the face carved
      in relief on the cameo resembles your biological mother. When the cameo is
      destroyed, the<br>spirit of the image carved in the cameo is summoned so
      long as the person featured on the cameo is dead (if the person is alive,
      destroying the cameo has no effect.) The spirit remains for up to 10
      minutes and is able to communicate with speech but otherwise unable to
      affect the Material Plane.</p>
