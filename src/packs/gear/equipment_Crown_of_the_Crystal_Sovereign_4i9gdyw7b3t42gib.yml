      <p>This crown looks like a braid of pure crystal and its front is a set of
      three pointed, curling spires that give its wearer an imposing, regal
      silhouette. Once worn by the monarch of an ancient crystal palace deep
      underground, the crown was lost after its wearer&rsquo;s grasping schemes
      brought calamity on their people. The power, ambition, and ruthless might
      of the Crystal Sovereign of Coranaal still lingers, granting the wearer
      the following properties:</p><p><strong>Crystal Skin.</strong> Your skin
      takes on a jagged, shimmering appearance and feels firm and cold to the
      touch. You gain +2 to your Armor Class. Additionally, when you&rsquo;re
      hit by a ranged spell attack, roll 1d4. On a 3, you are unaffected and the
      spell is reflected back at its caster, rolling again to see if it
      hits.</p><p><strong>All-Seeing.</strong> You gain truesight out to 30
      feet. Additionally, you can use this trait to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.usz7we3sepg9tv9d]{Clairvoyance}
      at will, using the crown as your material component.</p><p><strong>Lord
      Under The Mountain.</strong> Your Prestige Rating is increased by 2, or 4
      if you&rsquo;re underground.</p><p><strong>Regal Bearing.</strong> A
      number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier you can, as an
      action, target one creature that can see you within 60 feet. It must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency modifier +
      your Charisma modifier) or use its next turn to fall prone in
      supplication, taking no other actions. Additionally, when you&rsquo;re
      targeted with any attack by a creature within 10 feet of you, you can
      force it to make this saving throw as a reaction. On a failure it has
      disadvantage on the attack and then falls prone as
      above.</p><p><strong>Greed of Coronaal.</strong> It&rsquo;s said that,
      even as their palace crumbled, the Crystal Sovereign still coveted and
      guarded their treasures. You can use an action to summon an item from the
      hoard of Coronaal, an endlessly enormous extra dimensional space that you
      can access remotely. You instinctively know what&rsquo;s inside, and when
      you first access the hoard, roll on Treasure for Challenge Ratings 23-30
      to determine what&rsquo;s already there. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you
      have any desire to share, however, and must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving
      throw to willingly part, even temporarily, with any item that has been in
      the hoard.</p><p>You can also use an action to touch an item of up to
      Large size and send it to the hoard. However, the crown shuns items it
      deems unworthy, casting them into the Astral Plane if you attempt to store
      them. This includes magic items of common or uncommon rarity and any
      mundane items worth less than 500 gp. Additionally, as a security feature,
      creatures cannot enter this space; even the wearer can only access it
      remotely.</p><p>Otherwise, the hoard has the limitations of any other
      interdimensional space in regards to Supply and dead creatures. Placing
      another interdimensional item, such as a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.qf2ofov8rlaop2kr]{Portable Hole},
      in the hoard destroys the lesser item, scattering its contents across the
      Astral Plane. Additionally, 4 ([[/r 2d4]]) random valuables from the horde
      are also lost in this way, though the crown of the crystal sovereign is
      otherwise unaffected.</p><p><strong>Curse.</strong> When you attune to
      this crown, your Destiny immediately changes to
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-destinies.Item.4ee2167tvhkgnpki]{Dominion} if
      it&rsquo;s not already, and you can only fulfill it by reclaiming the
      Crystal Palace of Coronaal, which is lost to time and overtaken by
      creatures from the depths. You lose any existing Destiny features. In
      addition, if you have a chance to advance this Destiny (as determined by
      the Narrator) and do not take it, you lose all benefits from the crown and
      suffer a level of strife each week until you pursue the opportunity, at
      which point you lose all strife gained this way and regain the benefits of
      the crown. These levels of strife cannot otherwise be removed.</p><p>The
      crown remains firmly affixed to your head and cannot be removed in any
      way, nor can your attunement be broken, unless you are beheaded, at which
      point you can never attune to the item again, even if you are brought back
      to life. The only other exception is if you reclaim the Crystal Palace and
      then choose to, in the presence of 4 sentient creatures, formally renounce
      your title while sitting on the throne of Coronaal, at which point the
      palace and crown begin to crumble, ending your attunement and destroying
      the item.</p><p><strong>Escalation.</strong> When you fulfill this
      destiny, the save DC of Regal Bearing and the Armor Class bonus of Crystal
      Skin increase by 2, while the range of your truesight increases by 60 ft,
      your Prestige bonus is increased by 2, and you can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ppht0do531mq84uw]{Scrying} at
      will using the crown as a focus.</p>
