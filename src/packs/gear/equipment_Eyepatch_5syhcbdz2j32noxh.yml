      <blockquote><p>Eyepatches can be used to prepare one eye for lower light
      vision, especially for working on deck and in the relative darkness of a
      ship.</p></blockquote><p>When you are wearing an eyepatch and enter an
      area of darkness or dim light from a brightly lit area, you can use a
      bonus action to swap it from one eye to the other to gain an expertise die
      on <em>Perception</em> checks until you enter an area of bright light or
      for the next 10 minutes.</p>
