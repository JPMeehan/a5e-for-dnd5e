      <p>This magical book details workout routines for building coordination
      and speed. Spending 48 hours over 6 days (or fewer) reading and following
      the bookâ€™s regimen increases your Dexterity score and your maximum
      Dexterity score by 2. The manual<br>then becomes a mundane item for a
      century before it regains its magic.</p>
