      dir="ltr">This divination pendulum consists of a pyramidal piece of
      polished celestite that dangles from a delicate gold chain. Its user may
      write the words &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; on a piece of
      parchment, ask a question, and then dangle the pendulum above it. If the
      Narrator determines that the answer is clear, the pendulum will swing to
      either side, indicating the answer. If the answer is unclear or otherwise
      unable to be answered by a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo;
      it remains stationary. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used
      again until the next dawn.</p>
