      <p>This flask sloshes when shaken as if full of water. You can use an
      action to remove the stopper and speak a command word, causing undrinkable
      water to flow out of the flask. It stops at the start of your next turn.
      </p><p><em>Stream</em>. This command word produces 1 gallon of water.
      </p><p><em>Fountain</em>. This command word produces 5 gallons of water.
      </p><p><em>Geyser</em>. This command word produces 30 gallons of water
      that manifests as a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus
      action, you can aim the geyser at a target within 30 feet, forcing it to
      make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and be
      knocked prone. Any object less than 200 pounds is knocked over or pushed
      up to 15 feet away.</p>
