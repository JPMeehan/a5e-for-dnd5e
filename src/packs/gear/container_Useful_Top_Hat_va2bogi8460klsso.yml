      <p>This stylish and sturdy top hat conceals a useful feature: a small
      pocket dimension. You may store up to 50 pounds worth of items in the
      extradimensional space. Retrieving an item stowed this way requires a
      bonus action (to remove the hat) and an action (to retrieve the item). If
      you have never interacted with a specific useful top hat before, the first
      time you use it, it requires [[/r 1d4]] rounds to take stock of its
      contents before anything can be retrieved from the bag.</p><p>As with all
      extra-dimensional storage, food or drink placed inside immediately and
      permanently loses its nourishing qualities, and a body placed in it cannot
      be restored to life by
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.zontlhypt3b5gk6z]{Resurrection},
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.0k5zymq9q95l8jwa]{Revivify}, or
      similar magic. Living creatures cannot be placed in the space and are
      merely stowed as though in a mundane top hat if it is attempted. The
      pocket dimension cannot be accessed until the creature is removed. The hat
      cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal hat of its apparent
      size or any item with the Bulky quality. If the hat is punctured, torn, or
      otherwise structurally damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the
      contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane.</p><p>Placing a useful
      top hat inside another extradimensional storage device such as a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.2qmde8o6h8kkosvo]{Bag of
      Holding} results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls
      everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and
      disappears.</p>
