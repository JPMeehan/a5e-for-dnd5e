      <p>This dagger carves through minds as easily as flesh. You gain a +3
      bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>Weapon
      attacks using <em>mindrazor </em>deal an extra [[/r 2d6 #psychic]] psychic
      damage against creatures. When you roll a natural 20 on an attack with
      this weapon, the target becomes confused for 1 minute. At theend of each
      of its turns, a confused creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw,
      ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>You can use an action to
      work <em>mindrazor </em>upon the memories of a restrained or incapacited
      creature within 5 feet (as
      @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.2gcyh1jcj71nbb1y]{Modify Memory} cast at
      9th-level). Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until
      you have finished a short rest.</p>
