      <p>You can use an action to shackle an incapacitated Small- to Large-sized
      creature using these manacles. Once shackled, the creature is incapable of
      using or being affected by any sort of extradimensional travel or effect
      (including teleportation or plane shift spells and effects, but not
      portals). </p><p>You and any creature you designate when you use the
      shackles can use an action to remove them. At the end of every 2 weeks
      that pass, a shackled creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check
      to break free and destroy the shackles.</p>
