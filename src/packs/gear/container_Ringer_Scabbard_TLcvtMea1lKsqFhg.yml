    value: >-
      <p>This scabbard has a strip of metal close to the mouth that the weapon
      (typically a sword or dagger) can be rubbed against as it is drawn,
      creating a loud, metallic ring. Drawing a weapon this way gives you
      expertise on a single Intimidation check against creatures that witness
      you doing so. You can only gain this bonus against a creature once per
      day.</p>
