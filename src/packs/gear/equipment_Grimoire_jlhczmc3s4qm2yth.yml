      <p>These large and imposing tomes can function both as a spellbook and as
      a spellcasting focus.</p><p><strong><em>Arcane Focus:</em></strong> These
      foci are soaked in arcane power and often engraved or painted with
      eldritch symbols and cosmic iconography. Orbs, crystals, grimoires,
      staves, or wands are often used as spellcasting foci by sorcerers,
      warlocks, and wizards.</p>
