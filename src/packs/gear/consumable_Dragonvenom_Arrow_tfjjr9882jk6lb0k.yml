      <p>An arrow enchanted with dragonvenom deals an extra 21 (6d6) poison
      damage. When you hit a dragon with a dragonvenom arrow, the attack becomes
      a critical hit and the dragon makes a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a
      failure, attacks against the dragon have advantage until the start of its
      next turn.</p>
