      <p>You gain +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      sword. In addition, while you are attuned to the sword, on each of your
      turns before you make your first attack with it you can transfer some or
      all of the +3 bonus to your Armor Class (instead of using it for attacks)
      until the start of your next turn or until you drop the sword (whichever
      comes first)</p>.<hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon
      and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
