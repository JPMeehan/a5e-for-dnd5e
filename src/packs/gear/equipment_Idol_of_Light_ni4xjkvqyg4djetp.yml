      <p>This glass idol resembles a humanoid woman with a set of iridescent
      butterfly wings and a crystalline crown. The idol sheds bright light in a
      10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet at all times. It
      has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges each day if exposed to the
      light of dawn. You can expend the idol&rsquo;s charges to produce the
      following effects:</p><ul><li>When you take radiant or necrotic damage,
      you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and
      gain&nbsp;resistance</span>&nbsp;to that damage type for the next minute
      or until you use this property again.</li><li>As an action, you can expend
      2 charges to make the idol shed light, as if by the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ew3qtw0gvzelrmgg]{Daylight}<em>&nbsp;</em>spell,
      for 10 minutes.</li><li>As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel Magic},
      targeting an illusion or necromancy spell. You can increase the spell slot
      level by one for each additional charge you expend.</li><li>As a bonus
      action, you can expend 4 charges to cause the idol to flare with blinding
      light. Creatures you choose within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13
      Constitution&nbsp;saving throw</span>&nbsp;or
      be&nbsp;<span>blinded&nbsp;until the end of your next turn. Undead make
      the save with&nbsp;<span>disadvantage&nbsp;.</li></ul>
