      <p>You can pull an endless number of nonmagical arrows from this quiver.
      An arrow disappears when it is fired or if it leaves your possession for
      longer than 1 minute. While you carry the quiver, if no hostile creatures
      are within 30 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to aim,
      gaining&nbsp;advantage</span>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<span>ranged weapon
      attacks&nbsp;until the end of your turn.</p>
