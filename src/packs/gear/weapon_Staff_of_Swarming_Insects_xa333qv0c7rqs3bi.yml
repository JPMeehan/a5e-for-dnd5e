      <blockquote><p>(Requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
      Warlock, or Wizard)</p></blockquote><p>While holding this staff, you can
      use an action to expend charges to conjure an insect cloud, or cast one of
      the following spells, using your spell save
      DC:</p><ul><li><p><strong><em>Insect Cloud</em></strong> (1 charge): A
      swarm of harmless flying insects spreads out in a 30-foot radius from you,
      heavily obscuring the area for creatures other than you. It moves when you
      do, with you at its center. The radius of the swarm decreases by 10 feet
      each time you are included within an area of effect that deals damage. The
      insects remain for 10 minutes, until the swarmâ€™s radius is less than 10
      feet, or it is dispersed by strong wind</p><p></p></li><li><p><em>Giant
      Insect</em> (4 charges)</p></li><li><p><em>Insect Plague</em> (5
      charges)</p></li></ul><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>The staff has 10
      charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges each dawn.</p><p>When the last
      charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff is destroyed as it
      transforms into a swarm of insects which immediately
      disperse.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and
      you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
