      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>This thumb-sized opal is carved to resemble an
      open eye.</p><p>As an action, you can affix it to your forehead where it
      remains in place until you use another action to remove it.</p><p>While
      you wear the eye, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks you make
      while speaking telepathically with another creature.</p><p>You can use an
      action to expend 2 charges and cast <em>detect thoughts</em> on any
      creature with whom you have communicated telepathically during the last 24
      hours, regardless of your distance from the creature.</p><p>Alternatively,
      you can expend 3 charges to cast <em>clairvoyance </em>centered on the
      creature’s current location.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>The eye
      has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk.</p><p>When you expend the
      eye’s last charge, it permanently affixes to your forehead but otherwise
      becomes a normal opal.</p>
