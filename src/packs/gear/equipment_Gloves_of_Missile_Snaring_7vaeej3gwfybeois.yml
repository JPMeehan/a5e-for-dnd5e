      <p>While wearing these gloves, when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack
      you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity
      modifier, as long as you have a free hand.</p><p>If the damage is reduced
      to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough to be held in that
      hand.</p>
