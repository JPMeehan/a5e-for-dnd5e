      <p>This seemingly ordinary marble is very susceptible to air currents as
      though it were only a fraction of its true weight. When placed on a flat
      horizontal surface, such as the floor of a room or chamber, the marble
      rolls in the direction of the current path of air currents around it.
      </p><p>The marble has 1 charge. You can use an action to speak its command
      word while placing the marble on a flat horizontal surface, expending 1
      charge. The marble rolls towards the direction of the nearest exit of the
      chamber it is placed in, ultimately coming to rest against the nearest
      exit (regardless of air currents). The delicate calibration of the marble
      is destroyed and it becomes a mundane item.</p>
