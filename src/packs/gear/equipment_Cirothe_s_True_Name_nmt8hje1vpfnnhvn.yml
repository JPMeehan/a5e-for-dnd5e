      <p>Rather than a physical item, this artifact is a word which you activate
      by speaking it aloud on your turn (no action needed). When activated while
      you can see Cirothe within 1,000 feet, you gain control of her (as the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.9pyk9fklr2xff0ue]{Dominate
      Monster} spell, no saving throw) until the start of your next turn. Once
      Cirothe regains control of herself, for the next 1d4 rounds she is immune
      to the effects of a creature uttering her true name.</p><p>After being
      used, the name fades from your memory forever and you can never again
      learn it.</p>
