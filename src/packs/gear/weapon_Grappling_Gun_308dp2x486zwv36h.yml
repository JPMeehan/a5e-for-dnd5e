    value: >-
      <p>This device resembles a crossbow with a grappling hook fixed onto a
      spear that emerges from the front of it.</p><ul><li><p>You can use an
      action to fire it at a perch within 120 feet—<em>a crux of tree boughs,
      the corner of a building, the top of a street light, a cluster of rocks
      across a chasm</em> — and make a ranged weapon attack roll against AC
      13.</p><p>On a successful hit the device’s grappling hook affixes itself
      to the perch and you can use a bonus action to retract the line, moving to
      a square adjacent to the grappling hook.</p><p>When you are within 10 feet
      of the grappling hook you can use a reaction to return it to the grappling
      gun.</p><p></p></li><li><p>A grappling gun that has its line obstructed by
      another creature or broken (AC 20, 20 hit points) becomes inoperable until
      it is reloaded with an action.</p><p>In addition, you can fire the
      grappling gun as an attack against a creature (range 60/120 ft.), dealing
      1d4 bludgeoning damage.</p><p>On a hit the creature makes a DC 10 Strength
      saving throw or is knocked prone.</p></li></ul>
