      <p>This set of folding wings is worn as a backpack. You can extend or
      retract the wings as an action. While the wings are extended, you can move
      30 feet horizontally for every 15 feet you descend vertically and cannot
      gain altitude. They are typically used to glide safely down from cliffs,
      airships, or high structures, and occasionally for reconnaissance.</p>
