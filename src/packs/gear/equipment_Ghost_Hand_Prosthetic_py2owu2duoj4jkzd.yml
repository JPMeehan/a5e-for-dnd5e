      <p>This ornate bracer fits over the stump of a missing hand. You can use a
      mental command at any time (no action required) to summon a spectral,
      skeletal hand from the end of the bracer, allowing the user to function as
      though they had a natural hand in its place. You may also dismiss the
      hand, if desired (no action required). Finally, the hand can function as
      per the mage hand spell for up to an hour per day. The hour need not be
      continuous. While the hand is used this way, you lose the use of the hand
      as a normal hand until it returns.</p>
