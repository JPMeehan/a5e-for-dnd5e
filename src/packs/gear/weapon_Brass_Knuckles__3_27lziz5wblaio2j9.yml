      <hr><p><b>Hand-Mounted:</b> This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can
      do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon,
      and you have advantage on saving throws made to resist being disarmed. You
      cannot use a hand that is wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex
      tasks like picking a pocket, using thievesâ€™ tools to bypass a lock, or
      casting spells with seen components.</p>
