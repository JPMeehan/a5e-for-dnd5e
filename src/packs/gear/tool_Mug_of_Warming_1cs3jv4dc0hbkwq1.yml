      <p>This quilted-patterned mug is perfect for cold winter nights or when
      caffeinated beverages are a morning necessity. Any liquid poured into the
      mug is instantly warmed to a piping hot temperature, remaining hot even
      when poured out. The mug has no effect on any form of magical liquids
      poured into it. </p><p>The mug has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each
      dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge, splashing the contents of
      the mug into a 5-foot square in a conflagration of flame. Creatures and
      objects in the area make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 1d4
      #fire]] fire damage on a failure. If you expend the last charge, roll a
      [[/r 1d20]]. On a result of 5 or less, the mug loses its warming
      properties and becomes a mundane item.</p>
