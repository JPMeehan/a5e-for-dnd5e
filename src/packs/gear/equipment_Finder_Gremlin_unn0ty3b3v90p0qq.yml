      <p>This tiny ethereal silver goblinoid sits in a clamshell container along
      with a miniature cup of water and a single thin needle.</p><p>When
      prompted with a bonus action, the gremlin uses the old cup and needle
      trick to try and find magnetic north, although it is not particularly good
      at this.</p><p>Whenever the gremlin tries to find true north, the Narrator
      roll a d10:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1:</strong> it gets confused, pointing
      in the exact opposite direction
      instead.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong>2-10:</strong> it shows you
      magnetic north</p></li></ul>
