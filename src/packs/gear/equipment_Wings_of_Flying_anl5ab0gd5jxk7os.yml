      cloak, you can use an action speaking its command word to transform it
      into a pair of wings. The wings last for 1 hour or until you use an action
      to speak the command word to dismiss them. The wings give you a flying
      speed of 60 feet. After being used in this way, the wings disappear and
      cannot be used again for [[/r 2d6 #hours]] hours. </p>
