      <p>These lustrous black pearl earrings would look at home on a socialite
      but are rumored to have originated with a treacherous pirate captain. They
      always appear wet and give the air nearby the slightest taste of
      saltwater. You do not require pierced ears to wear the earrings and when
      placed against the lobe they naturally stick to your skin.  In addition to
      being highly fashionable, they can also help escape a tough jam.
      </p><p>You can use an action to drop and stomp on one of these earrings,
      destroying it as a cloud of darkness erupts in a 5-foot radius and extends
      10 feet in every direction for [[/r 1d4 #rounds]] rounds.</p>
