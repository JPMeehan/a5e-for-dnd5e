      <p>These hammers and clamps are a poor replacement for a full forge but
      can be instrumental for repairing metal items. With 1 hour of work you can
      use smith’s tools to mend many weapons and armors. The DC of a smith’s
      tools check is determined by the material being worked.</p>
