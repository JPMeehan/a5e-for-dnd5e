      <p>Not to be mistaken for a simple spectral camera, this plain-looking but
      obviously finely-made piece gives off a subtle but reassuring feeling of
      peace. As an action, you can use one charge to focus the camera&rsquo;s
      lens on a single creature within 30 feet and take its picture. If the
      targeted creature is an undead or a fiend, it must make a DC 17 Charisma
      saving throw or be instantly captured in a glass photographic plate. If
      the target is not an undead or fiendish creature the charge is wasted. Any
      other creatures shown in the photograph are unaffected, even if they are
      undead or fiends. The spirit-trapping camera can produce as many plates as
      it has charges, though each must be removed as a bonus action before you
      can use another charge.</p>

      <p>A trapped creature can be released by breaking the plate or it can be
      sent to its final judgment (in the case of an undead creature) or back to
      its native plane (in the case of a fiend) by immersing the plate in holy
      water for 1 hour, at which point it disappears. Creatures banished in this
      way cannot return to the plane they were sent away from for a year and a
      day by any means short of divine intervention. If neither of these actions
      are performed within 24 hours of the photograph being taken, the creature
      is banished as above, though it has no limitations on returning.</p>

      <p>The spirit-trapping camera has 3 charges and regains 1 each dawn. When
      the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, it becomes a mundane
      photochemical camera.</p>
