      <p class="MsoNormal">While wearing and attuned to this set of armor, once
      per dawn you can use an action to cast the etherealness spell. The spell
      lasts for 10 minutes, until the armor is removed, or until you use an
      action to end it.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><strong>Etherealness:</strong></p>

      <p>Until the spell ends or you use an action to end it, you step into the
      border regions of the Ethereal Plane where it overlaps with your current
      plane. While on the Ethereal Plane, you can move in any direction, but
      vertical movement is considered difficult terrain. You can see and hear
      the plane you originated from, but everything looks desaturated and you
      can see no further than 60 feet.</p>

      <p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by
      other creatures on that plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane can't
      perceive you unless some special ability or magic explicitly allows them
      to.</p>

      <p>When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated
      from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a
      solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to
      the nearest unoccupied space and you take force damage equal to twice the
      number of feet you are moved.</p>

      <p>The spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal
      Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as an Outer Plane.</p>
