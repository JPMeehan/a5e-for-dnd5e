  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This iridescent glass sphere’s color is constantly shifting. When used
      as an improvised weapon the orb breaks on impact. If the orb shatters
      against a creature, one randomly determined resistance or immunity the
      creature has is reduced for [[/r 1d6+1 #rounds]] rounds, after which the
      creature’s defenses return to normal. A creature’s immunity to a damage
      type changes to resistance to that damage type, or it loses its
      resistance. Success on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals what
      resistance has been affected after the orb is used.</p>
