      <p>Once attuned to this intricate golden brooch, you can imagine up to one
      dragon of your choice and a Tiny-sized illusion of it appears on your
      shoulders. The dragon looks lifelike and it occasionally flies, snaps at
      insects, and generally behaves in a dragon-like way. This illusion does
      not hold up to physical scrutiny and any creature who physically interacts
      with the dragon sees through the illusion with a successful DC 12
      Investigation check. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the
      illusion.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can have your dragon illusion
      attack a creature within 5 feet of you. That creature must make a DC 12
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 damage of a type of your choice (fire,
      lightning, cold, or acid) on a failed save or half as much on a successful
      one. Once you have used this feature, it cannot be used again for 24
      hours.</p>
