      <p>This innocuous-looking teapot has two internal chambers. You can choose
      which chamber to pour from simply by covering the corresponding hole in
      the handle with your finger or thumb. True to its name, a common use of
      this device is to surreptitiously serve poisoned tea to someone, though
      benign uses are not unheard of. Pouring a cup of liquid (poisoned or not)
      from the teapot takes an action.</p>
