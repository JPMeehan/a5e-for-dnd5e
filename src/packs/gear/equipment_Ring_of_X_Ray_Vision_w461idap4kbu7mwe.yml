      <p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Vial of tears from a
      couatl</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While wearing this ring, you can
      use an action to speak its command word and see through solid objects and
      matter in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. Solid objects within the radius
      appear ghostly and transparent, allowing light to pass through them. You
      can see through up 3 feet of wood and dirt, 1 foot of stone, and 1 inch of
      common metal (thicker materials or a thin sheet of lead block the
      vision).</p><p>When you use this ring again before taking a long rest, you
      make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of fatigue and
      strife.</p>
