      <p>This jade figurine carries the memories of a weretiger that spent years
      tracking and hunting its prey under the light of the jungle moon. When you
      attune to the item and keep it on your person, you gain an expertise die
      on Survival checks made to find and follow tracks for up to 1 hour per
      day.</p><p>When you speak the jade tiger’s command word, you vividly
      recall one of the weretiger’s most challenging hunts. For the next minute,
      you can use a bonus action to make a Stealth check to hide immediately
      before or after you take the Attack action. The jade tiger’s magic forever
      fades away after being used in this way.</p>
