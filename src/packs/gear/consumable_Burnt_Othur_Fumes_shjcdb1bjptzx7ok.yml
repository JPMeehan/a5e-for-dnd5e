      <p>Othur bog mold emits caustic spores that are both&nbsp;toxic and
      intensely flammable. A creature makes a&nbsp;DC 13 Constitution saving
      throw when subjected&nbsp;to this poison, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage
      on&nbsp;a failure, or half as much on a success. Additionally,&nbsp;a
      creature that fails its saving throw takes an&nbsp;additional 3 (1d6)
      ongoing poison damage for the&nbsp;next 3 rounds.</p>

      <p>If a cloud of this poison is exposed to an open flame or any target
      within it takes fire damage, the 5-foot radius cloud is immediately
      dispersed as it explodes. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failure, or half
      as much on a success.</p>
