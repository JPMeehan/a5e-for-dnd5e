      <p>This item is actually an aperture for the mouth of an immense
      extradimensional creature and is often mistaken for a bag of
      holding.</p><p>The creature can perceive everything placed inside the bag.
      Up to a cubic foot of inanimate objects can be stored inside, however once
      per day the creature swallows any inanimate objects inside and spews them
      into another plane of existence (with the Narrator deciding the plane and
      time of day). Animal or vegetable matter placed completely inside is
      instead ingested and destroyed.</p><p>This item can be very dangerous.
      When part of a creature is inside the bag (including a creature reaching a
      hand inside) there is a 50% chance the bag pulls it inside.</p><p>A
      creature that ends its turn inside the bag is ingested and destroyed. A
      creature inside the bag can try to escape by using an action and making a
      DC 15 Strength check. Creatures outside the bag may use an action to
      attempt to reach in and pull a creature out with a DC 20 Strength check.
      This rescue attempt is subject to the same 50% chance to be pulled
      inside.</p><p>Piercing or tearing the item destroys it, with anything
      currently inside shifted to a random location on the Astral Plane. Turning
      the bag inside out closes the mouth.</p>
