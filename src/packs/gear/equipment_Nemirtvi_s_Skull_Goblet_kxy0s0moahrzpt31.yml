      <p>While the construction of this cup is superlative, the magnificence of
      its craftsmanship is turned wicked by the grotesque gold-crowned humanoid
      skull that makes up its bowl. When you use this spellcasting focus to
      consume Supply during a long rest, you gain a 1d8 expertise die on your
      next Arcana or Religion check. After making this check, you make a
      Charisma saving throw (DC 1 + 1 per previous use of this property) or gain
      the Evil trait (making you radiate an aura of Evil).</p>

      <p>In addition, once per day you can place the blood of a creature that
      has died within the last hour into the goblet and drink from it. You
      instantly experi- ence the last 10 minutes of the creature&rsquo;s life
      through its senses, and you have disadvantage on your next Charisma saving
      throw against Nemirtvi&rsquo;s skull goblet.</p>
