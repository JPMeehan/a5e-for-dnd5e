    value: >-
      <p>This small coin seems to be made of diamond and bears the symbol of the
      Order of Night&rsquo;s End in gold&mdash;a shining sun. You can spend
      1d4+2 rounds pressing at the coin to break it, making a DC 13 Constitution
      saving throw on each of your turns and taking a level of fatigue on a
      failure. When the coin breaks, you can press the remains against the
      corpse of a creature that was slain less than 10 minutes ago to bring the
      creature back to life. Roll 1d20 and on a result of 5 or higher the
      creature is restored to life with 1 hit point and 3 levels of fatigue.
      Otherwise the slain creature is
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.3bqdjnpytxlpgcc4]{reincarnated}
      instead (as per the spell, but taking immediate effect).</p>
