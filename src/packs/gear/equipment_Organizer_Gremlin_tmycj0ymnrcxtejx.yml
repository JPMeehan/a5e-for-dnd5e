      <p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pen owned by a failed
      scribe</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>This small black pocketbook
      comes with a tiny ethereal gold goblinoid who holds a cheap pen and
      eagerly awaits your instructions. Roughly half of this 120 page book is
      blank scratch paper, and the other half is a calendar of the current year.
      The gremlin writes down anything you ask it to and even takes down
      dictation if requested. It will also mark reminders in the calendar and
      circle dates. Despite its love for writing however, its penmanship is
      quite poor, it doesn’t actually  understand what anything it’s writing
      actually means, and any word with 3 or more syllables is always
      misspelled. Accurately understanding anything the gremlin has written
      requires a DC 10 Intelligence check.</p>
