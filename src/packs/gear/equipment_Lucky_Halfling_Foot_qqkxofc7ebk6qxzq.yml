      <p>This small hairy humanoid foot has been chemically preserved and
      attached to a simple chain necklace as a pendant. Whenever you roll a
      natural 1 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw while wearing
      this necklace, you may choose to reroll and must use the new result. Once
      you make a reroll in this way, you cannot do so again for the next 24
      hours. In addition, halflings get an unnerving sense of this macabre
      trophy even when it is hidden, and while wearing this necklace you have
      disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks to influence
      halflings.</p><p>Alternatively, these mortal remains can be buried or
      burned properly through halfling funerary rites taking 1 hour. If these
      rites are completed, any creatures in attendance (a maximum of 8) gain a
      point of inspiration.</p>
