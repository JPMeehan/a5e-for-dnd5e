      <p>This unassuming-looking signet ring comes with sinister features. The
      first is a four-chambered extradimensional space, each of which can hold
      one dose of poison. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to press
      part of its filigree to deploy one of the poisons and apply it to a weapon
      or piece of ammunition. You have advantage on checks made to conceal this
      action from observers.</p><p>In addition, you can use a bonus action to
      whisper a command word that makes a garrote of shadowy force unspool from
      the ring. A creature grappled using this garrote has disadvantage on
      saving throws made to escape the grapple.</p><p>This ring’s magic is
      subtle and creatures have disadvantage on checks made to notice it is
      magical or determine its purpose.</p>
