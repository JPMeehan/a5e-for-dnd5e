      <p>Crafted with the ichor of a rust monster, this pale white mace looks
      and feels like bone, but has the heft of stone and consumes metal on
      impact. You gain +2 bonus to <span class="freelinking-link">attack and
      damage rolls</span> made with this magical mace. However, if your Strength
      score is less than 16 you suffer <span
      class="freelinking-link">disadvantage</span> on attack rolls made with the
      mace.</p>

      <p>On a successful attack, you can use your reaction to expend a charge
      and attempt to consume non-magical metal armor or a shield worn by your
      target, in addition to your normal damage. Alternately, when an attack
      misses you, you can use your reaction to spend a charge to deflect the
      weapon and attempt to consume it. Finally, you can use your action to
      spend a charge and touch the mace to any unattended non-magical metal
      object of Medium size or smaller and consume it.</p>

      <p>The wielder of an item you are trying to consume must succeed on a DC
      14 Constitution <span class="freelinking-link">saving throw</span> ,
      otherwise the item is destroyed. Unattended objects are automatically
      destroyed. The mace has 4 charges and regains 1d4 charges each dawn.</p>

      </div><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be used with a
      shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you
      make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for it,
      you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield or
      increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.</p>
