      <p>This book has a simple, line-drawn map of the world on its cover.
      Writing the name of a specific place (no bigger than a small town) on one
      of its blank pages will cause it to magically write out a 50 word
      description of the current weather conditions there. </p><p>There are 25
      blank pages. Pages cannot be erased or otherwise unbound from their target
      location once the name has been written.</p>
