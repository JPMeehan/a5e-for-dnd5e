      <p>Once per dawn, while holding this rod you can use an action to command
      obedience. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet
      makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is charmed by
      you for 8 hours. A creature charmed by you regards you as its trusted
      leader. The charm is broken if you or your companions either command a
      charmed creature to do something contrary to its nature, or cause the
      creature harm.</p>
