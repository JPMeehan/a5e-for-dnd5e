      <p>Made from herbal ingredients, this tin of soothing salve can help mend
      grievous injuries. You can apply medicinal salve to your or a willing
      creatureâ€™s wounds during a short rest. A creature treated with medicinal
      salve rolls a bonus hit die and adds the result to the total number of hit
      points regained during the short rest. When used with a bandage, the bonus
      hit die from a medicinal salve restores the maximum amount of hit points.
      Once a creature benefits from a medicinal salve, it cannot do so again
      until it finishes a long rest.</p>
