      <p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      sword. While you are attuned to the sword and use it to attack a fiend or
      undead, on a hit it deals an extra 2d10 radiant damage. In addition, while
      drawn the sword creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and
      friendly creatures in the aura gain&nbsp;<span

      class="freelinking-link">saving throws</span>&nbsp;against spells and
      other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the herald class,
      the aura increases to a 30-foot radius.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This
