      <p>This smooth iron sphere conceals a formidable set of restraints that
      unfolds into metal bands when thrown. Once between long rests you can use
      an action to throw it at a creature within 60 feet, treating it as if it
      were a ranged weapon attack with which you are proficient. On a hit, if
      the creature is Huge-sized or smaller it becomes restrained until you use
      a bonus action to speak a different command word and release it. </p><p>A
      creature can try to break the bands by using an action to make a DC 20
      Strength Check. On a success, the bands are broken and the restrained
      creature is freed. On a failure, the creature cannot try again until 24
      hours have passed.</p>
