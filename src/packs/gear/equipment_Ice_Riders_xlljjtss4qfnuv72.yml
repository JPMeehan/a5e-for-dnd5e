      <p>The magic focused in the soles of these boots enable you to traverse
      ice and snow as if it were solid, non-slippery ground. You ignore
      difficult terrain created by cold conditions. </p><p>When traveling over
      snow, you leave only 1/2-inch deep footprints, enabling you to walk over
      deep drifts without the dangers of falling in. Similarly, you can step
      onto a floating chunk of ice without fear of tipping it over, although
      jumping onto the ice will “push” it in the direction of the jump.</p>
