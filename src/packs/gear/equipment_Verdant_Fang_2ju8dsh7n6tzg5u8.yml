      <p>You can attune to this item only if you&rsquo;re in the good graces of
      the green dragon who granted it to you. You attune to the fang by pressing
      it into your mouth, whereupon it replaces one of your canine teeth. While
      attuned to the fang, you can speak and understand Draconic, and you can
      use an action to breathe a 15-foot cone of poison gas. Creatures in the
      area must make a DC 12 Constitution&nbsp;saving throw</span>, taking 4d6
      poison damage on a failed save or half the damage on a success. You
      can&rsquo;t use this property again until you finish a&nbsp;<span>long
      rest.</p><p>As an action, you can bite down on the fang, destroying it.
      Doing so sends a mental distress signal to the dragon who granted you the
      fang; the dragon immediately learns where you are and will come to your
      aid.</p>
