      <p>Long ago the souls of five evil dragons were ripped from their
      corporeal bodies and captured with arcana by mages that sought to end the
      tyranny of wicked winged serpents. Each is contained within an intricately
      inscribed crystal globe 10 inches across&mdash;though when the magic
      within is called upon, an orb swells to double its size and glows with a
      faint light revealing the color of the scales&nbsp;that once belonged to
      what little remains of the&nbsp;creature that now resides in it.</p>

      <p>While you are attuned to and holding an Orb of Dragonkind, you can use
      an action and speak a command word to attempt to control the draconic soul
      within by making a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, you can control the
      Orb of Dragonkind, or on a failure you are charmed by it. Both effects
      last until you are no longer attuned to the orb.</p>

      <p>While you are charmed by the orb, you cannot choose to end your
      attunement to it. In addition, the orb can innately cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.ml9ls27u9ncms8ko]{Suggestion}
      on you at will (save DC 18) to compel you to commit evil acts that serve
      its purposes&mdash;exacting revenge, attaining its freedom, spread
      suffering and ruin, encourage the worship of foul draconic deities,
      collect the other orbs of dragonkind, or whatever else the Narrator deems
      fit.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Legends and Lore</h2>

      <p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals&nbsp;the following:</p>

      <p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is an Orb of Dragonkind, an artifact with
      the power to control dragons.</p>

      <p><strong>DC 20</strong> Five orbs were made, each containing the soul of
      an evil dragon.</p>

      <p><strong>DC 25</strong> The orb can summon evil dragons, but does not
      actually control them.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Artifact Properties</h2>

      <p>An Orb of Dragonkind has two lesser artifact&nbsp;benefits, one lesser
      artifact detriment, and one&nbsp;greater artifact detriment.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Magic</h2>

      <p>While you are controlling an Orb of Dragonkind,&nbsp;you can use an
      action to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect Magic} at
      will. You can also expend 1 or more charges to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect Magic} (no
      charge), @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.ew3qtw0gvzelrmgg]{Daylight}
      (1 charge), @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.3zt20n8mf29x3eju]{Death
      Ward} (2 charges),
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.1vo427vjnzgzb5z2]{Cure Wounds}
      (5th-level version, 3 charges), or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.ppht0do531mq84uw]{Scrying} (save DC
      18; 3 charges).</p>

      <p>The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges each
      dawn.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Call Dragons</h2>

      <p>While you are controlling an Orb of Dragonkind,&nbsp;you can use an
      action to send a telepathic message&nbsp;in a 40-mile radius. Evil dragons
      that are mortal&nbsp;and in the area are compelled to take the
      quickest&nbsp;and most direct route to the orb, though they may&nbsp;not
      be friendly or pleased with being forced to&nbsp;answer the call. Once
      this property has been used,&nbsp;you cannot use it again for 1 hour.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Destroying an Orb</h2>

      <p>Despite its glass appearance, an Orb of Dragonkind&nbsp;is immune to
      most types of damage (including&nbsp;draconic breath weapons and natural
      attacks), but&nbsp;they can be destroyed by the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.suktewdv0zo7rgd0]{Disintegrate} spell
      or&nbsp;a single strike from a weapon with a +3 magical&nbsp;bonus to
      attack and damage rolls.</p>
