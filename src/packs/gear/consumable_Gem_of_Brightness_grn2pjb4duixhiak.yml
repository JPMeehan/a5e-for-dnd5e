      <p>While you are holding this gem, you can speak one of three command
      words to cause one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>0
      charges</strong>: The first command word can be used as a bonus action to
      cause the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for
      an additional 30 feet.</p><p>This effect doesn’t expend any charges and
      lasts until you repeat the first command word or use one of the other
      two.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong>1 charge</strong>: The second command
      word requires an action, causing the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light
      at one creature you can see within 60 feet. The creature makes a DC 15
      Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>The
      creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong>5
      charges</strong>: The third command word requires an action, causing the
      gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the
      area makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1
      minute.</p><p>A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
      each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p></li></ul><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>This prism has 50
      charges. When all of the gem’s charges are expended it loses all magical
      properties, becoming a mundane jewel worth 50 gold.</p>
