      <p>The hand on which you wear this bracelet transforms into a claw covered
      with a <strong>dozen wicked spines</strong>.</p><p>Your unarmed attacks
      with the claw deal 1d6 piercing damage, and you gain an expertise die on
      Sleight of Hand checks made to steal small items. Your hand returns to
      normal if you remove the bracelet.</p><p>As an action, you can draw upon
      the claw’s magic to cast produce flame. Whenever you use the claw in this
      way, one of the bracelet’s spines disappears and your hit point maximum is
      reduced by 1d8. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. If this
      effect reduces your hit point maximum to 0, you die and your body
      permanently transforms into a barbed devil. When the bracelet has no more
      spines it becomes a mundane item.</p>
