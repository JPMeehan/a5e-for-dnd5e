      <p>This quiver made by the elves of Greenfell contains the poison of the
      Spider Queen Sheeltielle. Any arrow placed into it gains the dragonvenom
      enchantment for up to 1 minute after it has been drawn back out.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Dragonvenom.</strong></em> An arrow enchanted with
      dragonvenom deals an extra 21 (6d6) poison damage. When you hit a dragon
      with a dragonvenom arrow, the attack becomes a critical hit and the dragon
      makes a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, attacks against the
      dragon have advantage until the start of its next turn.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>DESTRUCTION</p>

      <p>If you are in possession of the quiver and take fire damage from the
      breath weapon of a red dragon, you automatically fail your Dexterity
      saving throw and the quiver is destroyed. Otherwise the relic cannot be
      damaged.</p>
