    value: >-
      <p>This bag of consecrated salt can be spread onto up to 2 spaces adjacent
      to the user as an action. Undead, fiends, and aberrations treat a space
      covered with holy salt as difficult terrain and take 2d4 points of radiant
      damage the first time on a turn they enter such a space or when they start
      their turn there. The salt retains its potency for up to 8 hours. Adding
      another application of holy salt to a space already occupied by holy salt
      resets the duration, but produces no additional effect.</p>
