      <p>While wearing this helm, you gain the following benefits: </p><p>• You
      can use an action to cast detect thoughts (save DC 13) at will. While
      maintaining concentration, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic
      message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply with a bonus action
      while you are focused on it. If a creature successfully saves against this
      property, it becomes immune to it for 24 hours. </p><p>• Once between long
      rests, while focusing on a creature with detect thoughts you can use an
      action to cast suggestion (save DC 13) on that creature.</p>
