      This slightly enchanted book holds lessons for how to look healthier. When
      you spend 1 hour reading and memorizing the book’s lessons, after your
      next long rest for the following 24 hours you appear as if you’ve slept
      and eaten well for months. At the end of the duration, the effect ends and
      you are unable to benefit from this book until 28 days have passed.
