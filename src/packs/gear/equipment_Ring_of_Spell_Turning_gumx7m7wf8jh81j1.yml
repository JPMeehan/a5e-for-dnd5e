      saving throws against spells that target only you (not an area of effect
      spell). Additionally, on a saving throw with a natural 20 if the spell is
      7th-level or lower, the spell instead targets the caster, using their
      original slot level, spell save DC, spell attack modifier, and
      spellcasting ability.</p>
