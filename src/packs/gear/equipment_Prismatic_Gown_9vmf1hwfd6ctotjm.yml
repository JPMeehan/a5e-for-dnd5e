      <p>While it always remains perfectly fitted to the&nbsp;wearer, this
      ballroom gown constantly shifts&nbsp;between thousands of colors, styles,
      cuts and patterns. While wearing the prismatic gown, you&nbsp;gain
      advantage on saving throws made for the&nbsp;effects of spells from the
      prismatic school due to&nbsp;the odd magic woven into it.</p>
