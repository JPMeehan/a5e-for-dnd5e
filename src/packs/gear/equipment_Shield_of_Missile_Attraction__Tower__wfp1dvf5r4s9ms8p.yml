      <p><em>Tower shields increase your Armor Class by 2 and you gain an
      expertise die on Dexterity saving throws.</em></p><ul><li><p>While wearing
      this shield you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon
      attacks.</p></li></ul><p>When you take the Dodge action while wielding a
      tower shield, you may instead take cover behind your shield, gaining an
      expertise die to your Armor Class until the start of your turn.</p><p>You
      have disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks
      while wielding a tower shield, and you cannot squeeze through spaces
      smaller than your size category.</p><p>These shields cover the entire body
      and reduce your Speed by 10 feet.</p><p>On your turn, you may use an
      object interaction to plant it in the ground, gaining half cover (+2 bonus
      to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide) and
      advantage on saving throws made to resist being shoved or knocked prone
      and while you remain behind it. Unplanting a tower shield requires a bonus
      action.</p><p>Tower shields are bulky items, and count as such even when
      donned.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><blockquote><p><strong><em>Curse</em></strong>. Whenever a ranged
      weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, you become
      the target instead. Removing the shield does not stop the
      curse.</p></blockquote>
