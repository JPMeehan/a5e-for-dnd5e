      When found this thick glass bottle has 25 (5d10) small red rocks inside.
      You can use an action to throw a red rock to the ground to create a
      spectacular fireworks show that lasts for 1 round. The fireworks cast
      bright light for 50 feet and dim light for a further 30 feet, and they can
      be heard up to 200 feet away.
