      <blockquote><p>(Requires attunement by someone proficient in
      Survival.)</p></blockquote><p>This cloak is an unassuming neutral
      grayish-brown color that seems to slowly fade into the background whenever
      you are standing still.</p><p>You cannot attune to this cloak if you are
      not proficient with Survival.</p><p>While attuned to and wearing the
      cloak, you may treat a long rest as if you were in a haven. Once you use
      this property, you cannot do so again for 1 week.</p><p>In addition, the
      cloak allows you to travel at a fast pace while remaining stealthy.</p>
