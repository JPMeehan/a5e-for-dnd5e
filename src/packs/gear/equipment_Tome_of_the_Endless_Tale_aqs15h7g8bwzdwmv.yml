      <p>The stresses of a wizard’s education can overwhelm even the most
      stalwart apprentices without some sort of diversion.</p><p>Typically
      resembling a small, worn book with fanciful creatures or locales on
      battered leather covers, the tome’s pages fill with serialized stories
      that engage and distract the reader. Each tome focuses on a given genre
      (often romance or adventure) but the stories crafted within the pages are
      unique to each reader, tailored by the magic from their own imagination
      and so vibrant that the book’s tales seem to come to life in the mind’s
      eye.</p><p>Each tome has 3 charges.</p><p>When you speak the command word
      and use an action to expend 1 charge, its pages fill with a serial story
      tailored to the next reader that touches the tome.</p><p>This story
      typically takes 1 hour to read, continuing from where the last tale
      completed.</p><p>When you speak another command word and use an action to
      expend all 3 charges, the story created when the book is opened is
      particularly engrossing and the reader must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom
      saving throw or be enthralled, failing to notice anything that is not
      directly harmful.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>The tome has 3
      charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.</p><p>If you expend the last
      charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the tome loses its magic and
      becomes a mundane item.</p>
