      <p>This grisly trophy is the hand of a person hung at the gallows, dipped
      in wax rendered from their own fat and wicked with their own
      hair.</p><p>The fingers of this strange and complicated remnant of a
      malcontent can be lit just like a normal candle to shed bright light in a
      5-foot radius and dim light for a further 10 feet. The light shed by a
      gallow hand is only visible to its holder and is completely invisible to
      all other creatures.</p><p>Alternatively, all five fingers of the hand can
      be lit as an action. If the hand is lit in this way, it sheds bright light
      in a 10-foot radius and dim light for a further 20 feet. This light is
      invisible to the holder but visible to all other creatures.</p><p>Any
      creature other than the holder that enters this area of light for the
      first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Wisdom
      saving throw or become charmed. While charmed, a creatureâ€™s Speeds are
      reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.</p><p>Once lit in this way
      the gallow hand burns for 1 minute, after which it deteriorates into a
      molten nub.</p>
