      <p>Favored by those who deal with hauntings, a spectral camera can capture
      the image of spirits on film. Any creature with incorporeal movement or on
      the Ethereal Plane (visible or not) that passes in front of the
      camera&rsquo;s open aperture (up to 30 feet away) will trigger the camera
      to immediately take a monochrome picture. This has no effect on creatures
      affected by an
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.4eidicv0lyqevtwd]{Invisibility}
      spell. You can also take a picture manually as a reaction. Once a picture
      is taken, you must spend an action to prepare the camera for
      another.</p><p>Unlike physical objects, incorporeal beings do not need to
      stay still to appear on the resulting photo, though the entire process
      takes 1 minute to complete. Such photos do not need to be developed and
      show ghostly subjects in crisp detail, while all mundane aspects (chairs,
      corporeal creatures, etc.) are at best mildly blurry.</p><p>Each picture
      taken with a spectral camera costs 2 gp in materials, which are
      significantly rarer than those for a mundane photograph.</p>
