      <p>This wand can be used as a spellcasting focus and allows you to cast
      one additional cantrip as if you knew it, as long as it is on your spell
      list. Each cantrip wand has a cantrip imbued within it upon creation, and
      will be known by its name (such as a <em>fire bolt</em> wand or
      <em>light</em> wand).</p><p>Other implements exist for the storing of
      cantrips from other classes (like <em>cantrip holy symbols</em> or
      <em>cantrip instruments</em>), and though these are wondrous items they
      function like wands.</p>
