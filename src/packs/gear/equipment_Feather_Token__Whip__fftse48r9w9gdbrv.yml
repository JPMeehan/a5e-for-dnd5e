      <p>This small silver charm resembles a feather. Many types of feather
      tokens exist with different effects.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p>You can use an action to toss the token to a point that you
      can see within 10 feet. The token transforms into a floating whip that you
      can command by using a bonus action, making it move up to 20 feet and
      attack a creature up to 10 feet away from it. The whip has an attack bonus
      of +10 and deals 1d6+6 force damage.</p><p>The whip vanishes after 1 hour,
      when you die, or when you use an action to dismiss it.</p>
