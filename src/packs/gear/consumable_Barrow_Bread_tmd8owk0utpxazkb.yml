      <p>Barrow bread is made from mashing together plantains and starches that
      are grown in the tropical barrows.</p><p>While this viscous, starchy paste
      is not actually a bread, it perfectly preserves and maintains the
      temperature of any food tucked inside it for up to a week, protecting and
      preserving 1 Supply. The magic is contained in the plantain leaves that
      are wrapped around the barrow bread.</p><p>Once unwrapped, the barrow
      bread itself can be consumed (as 1 Supply) within 15 minutes before the
      outside elements spoil it.</p>
