      <p><strong>Crafting Components: </strong>Spite of an angry fey (a fey
      creature must be present and hostile for at least 1 hour of the item’s
      crafting time)</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While you are
      concentrating on a spell of 3rd-level or lower and attuned to this item,
      you can use a bonus action to activate it. Once activated, the rose
      maintains concentration on the spell for you for the duration or until you
      use another bonus action to stop the rose’s concentration. </p><p>The rose
      has 10 petals. When it is activated, a number of petals drop from the rose
      equal to the level of the spell it is concentrating on. At the end of each
      minute the spell continues, an equal number of petals drop from the rose.
      When its last petal falls the rose wilts and its magic is lost.
      </p><p>Alternatively, if the rose is thrown against the ground, the magic
      inside of it implodes and frays magical energies in a 15-foot radius (as
      the <em>dispel magic</em> spell, gaining a bonus to any
      spellcasting<br>ability checks equal to its number of petals).</p>
