      <p>While you are concentrating on a spell of 3rd-level or lower and
      attuned to this item, you can use a bonus action to activate it. Once
      activated, the rose maintains concentration on the spell for you for the
      duration or until you use another bonus action to stop the rose’s
      concentration. </p><p>The rose has 10 petals. When it is activated, a
      number of petals drop from the rose equal to the level of the spell it is
      concentrating on. At the end of each minute the spell continues, an equal
      number of petals drop from the rose. When its last petal falls the rose
      wilts and its magic is lost. </p><p>Alternatively, if the rose is thrown
      against the ground, the magic inside of it implodes and frays magical
      energies in a 15-foot radius (as the <em>dispel magic</em> spell, gaining
      a bonus to any spellcasting<br>ability checks equal to its number of
      petals).</p>
