    value: >-
      <p>This metal polearm has complex flanged baffles along its haft and ends
      with a faintly glowing two-tined cap not unlike a tuning fork.</p><p>When
      struck it reverberates near-deafeningly and by adjusting its components
      you can tune it to the destructive resonance of an
      object.</p><ul><li><p>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
      with this magic weapon. It constantly emits a high-pitched whine that is
      uncomfortable to animals. Animals do not willingly approach within 10 feet
      of the staff without a successful DC 22 Animal Handling
      check.</p><p></p></li><li><p>Attacks with this weapon deal double damage
      against doors and other objects.</p><p></p></li><li><p>Once per day, you
      can use an action to slam it against the ground and generate a wave of
      thunder and force, either in a 10-foot radius or 30-foot cone. Creatures
      in the area take 3d6 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away. This
      effect cannot penetrate a <em>silence </em>spell (or any similar magical
      silence effect).</p></li></ul><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are
      wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next
      turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee
      attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this
      property while incapacitated , paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or
      stunned.</p>
