      <p>While you are attuned to and wearing a transforming cloak, you gain
      resistance to a type of damage and you can use an action to activate an
      elemental form that lasts for 1 hour, until you fall unconscious, or you
      use a bonus action to end it.</p><p>Once you have used the cloak to take
      on an elemental form, you cannot use that property again until you have
      finished a long rest.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><em>This fine
      blue and green cloak always appears to be wet, yet it never
      drips.</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While your water form is
      active you gain:</p><ul><li><p>resistance to fire
      damage</p><p></p></li><li><p>a swim speed of 60
      feet</p><p></p></li><li><p>the ability to breathe
      water</p><p></p></li><li><p>you can pass through space at least half an
