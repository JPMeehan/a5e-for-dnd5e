      <p>This item appears to be a dagger hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can
      use a bonus action to cause a blade of purple flames to spring into
      existence, or make the blade disappear.</p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to
      attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals psychic damage
      instead of piercing damage. When a fey, giant, or humanoid creature is
      slain using this weapon, for the next [[/r 1d4+2]] days the resulting
      corpse can be possessed (such as by magic jar or a ghost) as though it
      were still alive.</p><p>Alternatively, during that time you may expend a
      charge to use the dagger to animate the corpse as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.xs292gklnxyaeuyx]{Animate Dead}
      with a casting time of 1 action. You must reassert your control over the
      undead creature within 24 hours using 1 charge, or it ceases obeying any
      commands. Casting the animate dead spell on such a creature has no effect.
      Regardless, it reverts to a corpse when the allotted time is up and cannot
      be reanimated in this way again. The dagger has 4 charges and regains 1d4
      expended charges each dawn.</p>
