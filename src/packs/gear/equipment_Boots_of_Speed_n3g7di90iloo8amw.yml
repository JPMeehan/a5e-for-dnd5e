      While wearing these boots, you can use a bonus action to click the heels
      together. You double your Speed, and opportunity attacks made against you
      have disadvantage. You can end the effect as a bonus action. Once the
      boots have been used in this way for a total of 10 minutes (each use
      expends a minimum of 1 minute), they cease to function until you finish a
      long rest.
