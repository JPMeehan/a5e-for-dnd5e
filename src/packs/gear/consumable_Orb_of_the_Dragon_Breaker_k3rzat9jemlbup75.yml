    value: >-
      <p>This iridescent glass sphere resembles a soap bubble tinted the color
      of the dragon scale used to create it. When used as an improvised weapon
      the orb breaks on impact. If the orb shatters against a creature, the
      creature’s immunity or resistance to a damage type associated with the
      dragon scale used in the orb’s creation (fire for a red dragon scale, acid
      for a green dragon scale, and so on) is either reduced from immunity to a
      damage type to resistance to the same damage type, or it loses its
      resistance. The orb’s effects last for [[/r 1d6+1 #rounds]] rounds, after
      which the creature’s defenses return to normal.</p>
