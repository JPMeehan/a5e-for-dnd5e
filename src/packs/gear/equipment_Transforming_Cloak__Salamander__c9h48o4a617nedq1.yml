      resistance to a type of damage and you can use an action to activate an
      elemental form that lasts for 1 hour, until you fall unconscious, or you
      use a bonus action to end it.</p><p>Once you have used the cloak to take
      on an elemental form, you cannot use that property again until you have
      finished a long rest.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><em>This cloak
      appears to be made of living flames, though it does not burn.</em></p><hr
