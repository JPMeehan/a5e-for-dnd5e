      <p>This milky liquid gives living creatures the superficial appearance and
      weakness of being a vampire. A creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving
      throw when subjected to this poison, and on a failure it becomes
      afflicted. The afflicted creature becomes pale, its canines grow long, and
      direct sunlight burns it like flame. When the afflicted creature ends its
      turn in an area of sunlight or first enters into an area of sunlight on a
      turn, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or becomes poisoned until
      it ends its turn in an area of dim light or darkness. At the end of each
      long rest, an afflicted creature can make a DC 17 Constitution saving
      throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
