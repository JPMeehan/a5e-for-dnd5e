    value: >-
      <p>This elaborate 50 pound mirror hides an extradimensional prison beneath
      its smooth, silvery surface. </p><p>You can use an action to activate or
      deactivate the mirror by speaking its command word while within 5 feet.
      While active, when a creature other than you sees its reflection in the
      mirror while within 30 feet, it makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.
      Creatures that are aware of the mirror’s nature have advantage, and
      constructs automatically succeed. On a failure, the creature and all its
      possessions are trapped inside one of the mirror’s 12 extradimensional
      cells. </p><ul><li><p>Each extradimensional cell is an infinite plane
      filled with thick fog. Creatures trapped within do not need to eat, drink,
      or sleep, nor do they age.</p></li><li><p>Creatures can escape via planar
      travel, but are otherwise trapped until freed. </p></li><li><p>If a
      creature is trapped but the mirror’s cells are already full, a randomly
      determined trapped creature is freed so the new creature may be
      trapped.</p></li><li><p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an
      action to call forth a trapped creature. The creature appears in the
      surface of the mirror, allowing you and the creature to communicate
      normally.</p></li><li><p>A trapped creature can be freed by using an
      action to speak a different command word. The creature appears in an
      unoccupied space near the mirror and facing away from
      it.</p></li></ul><p>When the mirror (AC 11, 10 hit points, vulnerability
      to bludgeoning damage) is reduced to 0 hit points it shatters, freeing all
      trapped creatures. The creatures appear in unoccupied spaces nearby .</p>
