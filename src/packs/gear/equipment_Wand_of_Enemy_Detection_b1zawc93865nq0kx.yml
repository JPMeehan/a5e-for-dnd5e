      <p><strong>Crafting Components</strong>: A scrying spell cast by a
      couatl</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to speak its command
      word and expend 1 charge to extend your senses for 1 minute. You sense the
      direction (but not precise location) of the nearest creature hostile to
      you within 60 feet (this includes ethereal, invisible, disguised, and
      hidden creatures, as well as those in plain sight). The effect ends early
      if you stop holding the wand.</p>

      <p>This wand has 7 charges and regains [[/r 1d6+1 #charges]] expended
      charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]].
      On a 1, the wand disappears the next time it is unobserved.</p>
