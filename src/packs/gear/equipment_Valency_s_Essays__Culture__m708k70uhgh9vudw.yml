      <p>Valency was a renowned expert on divination and illusion magic and
      spent many years studying the extraction of memory and developing the
      necessary expertise to create her Essays. The rumors that she perfected
      this craft in the torture chamber have never been proven, but make some
      leary of her work. What remains to this day are a series of beautiful
      tomes, filled with exquisite script and images that enable individuals to
      pick up a skill in minutes that might otherwise take a lifetime to
      master.</p>

      <p>Skimming a volume of Valency&rsquo;s Essays for 10 minutes grants you
      proficiency with the skill, language, or tool it covers, as well as an
      <span class="freelinking-link">expertise die</span> to any checks using it
      for 24 hours. At the&nbsp;end of the duration, the effect ends and you are
      unable to benefit from this book until 7 days have passed. Only one
      creature can benefit from this effect at a time.</p>

      <p>Versions of Valency&rsquo;s works have been found that cover the
      following: Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Intimidation, Medicine,
      Survival, Draconic, Elvish, Gnomish, a poisoner&rsquo;s kit, and
      smith&rsquo;s tools.</p>
