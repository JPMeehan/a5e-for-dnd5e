      Both the frame and lenses of these magnificent spectacles are made of the
      finest crystal. While you are wearing and attuned to the spectacles, you
      are immune to mental stress effects that would result from a visual
      encounter, you have advantage on saving throws against sight-based fear
      effects, and you are immune to gaze attacks.
