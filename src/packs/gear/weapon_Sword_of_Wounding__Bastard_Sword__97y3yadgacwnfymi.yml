      u-my-md"><p>Once per turn, when you use this sword to hit a creature with
      a melee weapon attack, in addition to dealing the attack damage you may
      inflict it with a wound.</p><p>A wounded creature takes 1d4 necrotic
      damage at the start of each of its turns for each wound you have inflicted
      this way. Whenever the creature is damaged by its wound, it can make a DC
      15 Constitution saving throw, ending all wound effects it is suffering
      from on a success.</p><p>Alternatively, the wounds can be healed if the
      wounded creature (or a creature within 5 feet of it) uses an action to
      make a DC 15 Medicine check, ending all wound effects it is suffering from
      on a success.</p><p>Damage dealt by this sword can only be regained by
      taking a short or long restâ€” no other method, magical or otherwise, will
      restore the hit points.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding
      this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you
      can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made
      against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while
      incapacitated , paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
