      <p>This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name “Airy
      Nightengale” surrounded by shifting autumn leaves. While you are attuned
      to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this parchment to
      summon a vision of a powerful archfey beside you for 1 minute. Airy acts
      catty and dismissive but mellows with flattery. Once a vision is summoned
      in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.</p><p>You
      can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the
      following:</p><p>• Perform minor acts of nature magic (as
      druidcraft).</p><p>• Whisper charming words to a target creature within 5
      feet. Creatures whispered to in this way must make a DC 13 Charisma saving
      throw, on a failed save targets become charmed by the vision until the end
      of their next turn, treating the vision and you as friendly
      allies.</p><p>• Bestow a magical fly speed of 10 feet on a creature within
      5 feet for as long as the vision remains.</p><p>Alternatively, as an
      action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on
      Aerodite in exchange for her direct assistance. When you do so the
      parchment disappears in a flurry of autumn leaves, and for the next minute
      the figment transforms into an alluring vision of the Dreaming at a point
      you choose within 60 feet (as hypnotic pattern, save DC 13). Once you have
      revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Aerodite’s true name
      again.</p>
