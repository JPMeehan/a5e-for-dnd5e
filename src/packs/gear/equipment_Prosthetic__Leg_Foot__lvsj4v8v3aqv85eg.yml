      <p>Prosthetics are usually metal and custom made to replace whatever
      portion of a limb has been lost.</p><p>Leg or Foot: While you are standing
      on your prosthetic, you cannot gain advantage or expertise dice on saving
      throws made to resist being knocked prone, and you take half damage from
      caltrops, spikes, and difficult terrain that deals damage. Depending on
      how your prosthetic is constructed, you can use it to store up to one
      concealed Tiny item (DC 15 Investigation or Perception check to
      notice).</p>
