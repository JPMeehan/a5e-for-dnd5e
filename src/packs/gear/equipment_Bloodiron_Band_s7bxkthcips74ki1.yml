      <p>The Bloodiron Band gleams a metallic crimson and is set with dozens of
      spikes on the inside so that it pierces the skin as it closes on the
      forearm during attunement. Wearing this band increases your Strength to
      20. It has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than
      20.</p><p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> Because of the horrific
      materials required in its construction, each band comes with a terrible
      cost. While attuned to the bloodiron band, your maximum hit points are
      reduced by a number equal to twice your level. Additionally, at the start
      of your turn, if another creature within 15 feet of you is bloodied, you
      must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (gaining advantage if the creature
      is an ally). On a failure, you must attempt to move to a space within
      reach and take the attack action against that creature.</p>
