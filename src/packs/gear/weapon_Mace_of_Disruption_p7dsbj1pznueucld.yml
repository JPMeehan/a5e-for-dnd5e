      <p>Fiends and undead take an extra [[/r 2d6 #radiant]] radiant damage when
      hit with this weapon. When this weapon reduces a fiend or undead to 25 or
      fewer hit points, the creature makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or it is
      destroyed. On a successful save the creature becomes frightened of you
      until the end of your next turn.</p><p>While it is held, this weapon
      shines bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light an additional 20
      feet.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be used with
      a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When
      you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for
      it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield
      or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.</p>
