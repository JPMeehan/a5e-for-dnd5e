      <p><strong>(Patron Token)</strong></p><p>This ring reeks of muck dredged
      from the ocean floor.</p><p>While you wear it, you automatically know the
      depth of any body of water you can see.</p><p>As an action, you can cause
      one submerged, unattended object up to Huge size to rise to the surface of
      the water at a rate of 500 feet per round. You don’t need to be able to
      see the object you affect, but you must be familiar with it or at least
      possess a general description of it.</p><p>Once the object reaches the
      water’s surface, it floats there for 1 hour or until you use another
      action to return it to its resting place.</p><p>Once you’ve used the ring
      in this way, it loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
