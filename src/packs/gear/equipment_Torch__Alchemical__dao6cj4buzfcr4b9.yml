      <p>The rough, sticky tar at the end of this torch burns through even the
      most adverse conditions. An alchemical torch burns for 1 hour even in
      heavy rains, strong winds, and underwater (albeit poorly when submerged,
      shedding only dim light in a 5-foot radius). Dimmer than a normal torch,
      it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional
      10 feet.</p>
