      <p>While you are attuned to and wielding this shortsword&nbsp;and at your
      hit point maximum, instead of&nbsp;making a melee weapon attack you can
      strike at the&nbsp;air to create a blade of magical force. Your
      blades&nbsp;of magical force are ranged spell attacks that
      use&nbsp;Strength or Dexterity (your choice), have a range&nbsp;of 30/60
      ft., and deal 1d6 force damage. When you&nbsp;are not at your hit point
      maximum, this shortsword&nbsp;becomes a mundane
      item.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be used with
      a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When
      you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for
      it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield
      or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and you are
      not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise
      die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by a
      creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
