      with the staff, you cause it to emit a thunderclap audible up to 300 feet
      away. The target makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or it is stunned
      until the end of your next turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lightning

      wide line of lightning from the staff. Each creature in the area makes a

      can use an action to create a thunderous roar audible up to 600 feet away.

      minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t
      deafened.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thunder and Lightning</strong>. You can
