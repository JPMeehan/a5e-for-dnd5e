      <p>These round glasses have a thin black metal frame and lenses that
      softly shimmer green. Engraved into the arms are very subtle rodents
      arranged into a helix.</p><p>While you are wearing the glasses, you can
      see the paths that rodents have traveled in the last two days. The paths
      appear as shimmering green lines that reach upwards. The sooner a rat has
      traveled the path, the brighter the trail appears.</p><p>When observed
      under the effects of <em>detect magic</em>, a small spectral rat crawls
      off of the glasses and squeaks.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use an action
      to snap the glasses in half and cast <em>charm monster</em> (save DC 13)
      on up to 10 rats you can see within range. Unlike normal, the duration of
      the spell is reduced to 1 minute.</p>
