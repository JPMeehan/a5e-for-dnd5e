      <p>These dark, dense bread rolls are incredibly filling, but leave an
      unpleasant, greasy taste in your mouth.</p><p>Each piece of Gloam Bread is
      considered one Supply. When consumed, you have advantage on Wisdom saving
      throws against the Fellspire Gloaming challenge for 24 hours. In addition,
      you can make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, reducing your strife by one
      level on a success. Once a creature reduces its strife in this way it
      cannot do so again until it has had a long rest.</p>
