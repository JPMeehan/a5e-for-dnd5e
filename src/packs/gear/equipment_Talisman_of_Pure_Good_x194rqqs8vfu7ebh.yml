    value: >-
      <p>This talismanâ€™s purity harms creatures that do not have the Good trait,
      dealing 6d6 radiant damage when touched (or 8d6 radiant damage to a
      creature with the Evil trait). A creature carrying or holding this item
      takes the same damage at the end of each of its turns as long as it does
      so.</p><p>A cleric or herald with the Good trait can use this talisman as
      a holy symbol, which grants a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while held or
      worn.</p><p>In addition, the talisman has 7 charges.</p><p>While wielded
      or worn, you can use an action to expend a charge and choose a target
      within 120 feet that is on the ground. If the creature has the Evil trait,
      it makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or is destroyed by a flaming pit
      that appears beneath it. Once the pit closes no trace of it or the target
      remains.</p><p>Once all charges are expended, the talisman collapses into
      golden specks of light.</p>
