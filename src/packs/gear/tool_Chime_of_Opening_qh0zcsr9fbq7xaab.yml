      <p>You can use an action to strike this foot-long metal tube while
      pointing it at an object that can be opened (such as a lid, lock, or
      window) within 120 feet. The chime sounds and one lock or latch on the
      object opens as long as the sound can reach the object. If no closures
      remain, the object itself opens. After being struck 10 times, the chime
      cracks and becomes useless.</p>
