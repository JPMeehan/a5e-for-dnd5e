      dir="ltr">The black handle of this ritual dagger is carved with intricate
      images of the hearth: healing herbs and flowers, as well as berries and
      wheat. The handle has three bands of carnelian at set intervals.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Each of the three bands represents a charge. As an action,
      you may choose to expend a charge to cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.c9itysok7lr2ai51]{Scorching
      Ray} spell. If you choose to expend more than one charge at a time, treat
      it as if the spell was cast at a higher level (maximum two levels higher
      than 2nd). Charges that are used do not replenish, and a carnelian band
      disappears for each one expended. Once all three charges have been used,
      the athame reverts to a mundane weapon with the statistics of a
      dagger.</p>
