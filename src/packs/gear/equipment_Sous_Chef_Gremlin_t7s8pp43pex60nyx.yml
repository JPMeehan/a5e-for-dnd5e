      dir="ltr">This Tiny, ethereal, mottled-brown goblinoid is contained in a
      spice jar. It wears a stained apron, carries an appropriately-sized set of
      cooking utensils, and has a perpetually annoyed look on its face.</p><p
      dir="ltr">Once per day, you may instruct the gremlin to prepare a meal of
      your choosing. Regardless of what meal you request, the sous chef gremlin
      only knows how to prepare potato crisps. If you complain about the meal,
      the gremlin berates you. The gremlin&rsquo;s &ldquo;meal&rdquo; prepared
      in this way counts as one Supply, but really it&rsquo;s mostly just empty
      calories.</p>
