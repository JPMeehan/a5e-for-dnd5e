      <p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and
      touch it to one willing beast or humanoid. If the target is a humanoid,
      for the next hour it gains an expertise die on Deception, Intimidation,
      and Persuasion checks, as well as on Performance checks made to act,
      orate, or otherwise speak in front of a crowd. If the target is a beast,
      it gains the ability to speak one language that you are proficient with
      for the next hour.</p>

      <p>This wand has 5 charges and regains [[/r 1d4+1 #charges]] expended
      charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]].
      On a 1, the wand emits a cacophony of voices and animal noises audible
      within 100 feet for 1 minute then loses its magical properties.</p>
