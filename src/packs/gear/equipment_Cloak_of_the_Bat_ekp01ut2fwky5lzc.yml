      <p>While wearing this cloak, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
      checks. In addition, while in an area of dim light or darkness, you gain
      the following benefits:</p><p>• A fly speed of 40 feet while gripping the
      edges of the cloak with both hands. </p><p>• Once between long rests you
      can use an action to cast <em>polymorph</em> on yourself, transforming
      into a bat. Unlike normal, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and
      Charisma scores.</p>
