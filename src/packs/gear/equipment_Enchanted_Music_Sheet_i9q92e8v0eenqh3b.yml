      <p>This music sheet of fine parchment documents musical notation of a fey
      performance.</p><p>Humming, whistling, or using an instrument to play the
      opening three notes causes the sheet music to issue the sounds of a
      hauntingly beautiful musical performance for 10 minutes. Up to 6 creatures
      of your choice that are within 30 feet of the sheet and able to hear the
      entire performance gain 2 temporary hit points. A creature canâ€™t gain
      temporary hit points from the music sheet again until it completes a long
      rest, and after using this feature you cannot do so again until you finish
      a short or long rest.</p><p>During a short rest, you can spend an hour to
      amend the music sheet with pen and ink to alter its melody and mood.
      Regardless of the changes you make to the sheet, the notation remains
      legible and the music is always lovely.</p><p>If you accompany the music,
      using an instrument or singing with a DC 12 Performance check, you can
      empower its magic. Up to 6 creatures of your choice that are within 30
      feet of you and able to hear the entire performance regain 3 hit points
      and gain 6 temporary hit points.</p><p>At the end of the performance, the
      music sheet transforms into a flutter of petals and butterflies, and its
      magic is lost.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><blockquote><p><strong>Curse</strong>. The music sheet is cursed
      and a creature with temporary hit points gained by its music has
      disadvantage on saving throws to resist being charmed and frightened by
      celestials, fiends, and fey. Empowering the magic with your own
      performance draws the attention of a fey who seeks you out to perform at
      an event of their choosing.</p></blockquote>
