    value: >-
      <p>You can use the poison in these vials to coat one slashing or piercing
      weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency
      for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition.</p><p>Basic:
      When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it
      makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or takes 2d4 poison damage and is
      poisoned until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Applying a poison takes an
      action. A creature immune to the poisoned condition is immune to any
      effects from poisons.</p>
