      This pair of amber dragonfly wings holds the memories of a native of the
      Dreaming who befriended several insect companions. You can speak with
      insects when carrying the wings in your hand or wearing them as a piece of
      jewelry. When you speak the name of the fey creature whose memories lie
      within the wings, you briefly experience the sensation of flying atop a
      giant dragonfly. For 1 minute after speaking the name, you can glide up to
      60 feet per round. This functions as though you have a fly speed of 60
      feet, but you can only travel horizontally or on a downward slant. The
      wings crumble to dust after the gliding effect ends.
