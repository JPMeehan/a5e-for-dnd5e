      <p>A wish made from the innocent heart of a scullery maid created these
      magical shoes, upon which she danced her way into a better life. You can
      only attune to these shoes if you are the first creature to do so. When
      you attune to the shoes, they resize to perfectly fit your feet and your
      feet alone. During the day they take the form of simple wooden clogs, and
      by night the shoes transform into beautiful glass slippers that somehow
      hold your weight without breaking. </p><p>While wearing these shoes as
      clogs, your Wisdom score increases by 2 and you gain an expertise die on
      Animal Handling checks. While wearing these shoes as glass slippers, your
      Charisma score increases by 2 and you gain an expertise die on Performance
      checks. </p><p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to shatter the
      glass slipper against the floor, sending shards exploding outward in a
      10-foot radius. Creatures and objects in the area make a DC 15 Dexterity
      saving throw, taking 8d6 magical piercing damage on a failed save or half
      as much on a success. Afterwards the area becomes difficult terrain, and
      the remaining shoe becomes a mundane item.</p>
