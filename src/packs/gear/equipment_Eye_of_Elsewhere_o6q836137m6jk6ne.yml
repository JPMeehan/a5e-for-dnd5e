      <p>This gray stone orb is carved into the likeness and&nbsp;size of a
      disquietingly realistic human eye with a&nbsp;ruby iris. Once you have
      attuned to it you can use&nbsp;an action to set the eye in a gentle orbit
      around your&nbsp;head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature
      may&nbsp;use an action to try and take an orbiting eye, but&nbsp;must make
      a melee attack against AC 24 or make a&nbsp;DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics)
      check. The eye&rsquo;s AC is&nbsp;24, it has 30 hit points, and resistance
      to all damage.&nbsp;While orbiting your head, it is considered a
      worn&nbsp;item. You can use an action to seize and stow the&nbsp;eye,
      returning it to an inert and inactive state.</p><p>While the eye is
      actively orbiting your head, your Intelligence score increases by 2 (to a
      maximum of 22), you gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks and
      Perception checks, and you cannot be surprised or
      blinded.</p><p><em><strong>Innate Arcane Eye.</strong></em> While the eye
      orbits your&nbsp;head, you know and can innately cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.1sp8qzuofkjmunsd]{Arcane Eye}
      without expending a spell slot or the need for&nbsp;material
      components.</p><p><em><strong>Shared Paranoia.</strong></em> After you
      have attuned to&nbsp;the eye and it has been and active for 24
      hours,&nbsp;you develop a paranoia that persists as long as
      it&nbsp;remains active. While paranoid you have disadvantage&nbsp;on
      Insight checks and you are considered&nbsp;roughing it if you sleep in the
      same room or tent&nbsp;as another humanoid
      creature.</p><p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The eye is a sentient
      construct with&nbsp;Intelligence 20, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 8.
      It&nbsp;cannot hear, but has blindsight and darkvision to&nbsp;a range of
      60 feet. The eye communicates with&nbsp;you and other creatures within 60
      feet telepathically&nbsp;and can read, speak, and understand
      Abyssal,&nbsp;Common, Deep Speech, and
      Undercommon.</p><p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The eye of
      elsewhere contains&nbsp;the soul of something utterly alien to
      humanoid&nbsp;perceptions, betrayed and plunged into a&nbsp;constrained
      form. It is constantly paranoid and convinced that some worse fate could
      befall it at&nbsp;any moment. Once attuned it will try to
      learn&nbsp;everything and anything you know, especially&nbsp;secrets. If
      you are forthcoming with information&nbsp;the eye grows to trust you, but
      can be brought&nbsp;into conflict if you withhold any
      information.&nbsp;When in conflict the eye shuts and you no
      longer&nbsp;gain any of the eye&rsquo;s benefits or properties
      except&nbsp;for Shared Paranoia. The eye only opens again if&nbsp;you
      divulge an important secret or the information&nbsp;initially
      withheld.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Eye.</strong></em> The eye is
      unbreakable but&nbsp;it has the power to implode and disintegrate
      itself.&nbsp;Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces&nbsp;the eye
      that some horrifying and frightening&nbsp;threat is inevitably soon to
      befall it. Rather than&nbsp;accept its fate, the eye destroys itself and
      blinks&nbsp;out of existence. On a failed check, the
      creature&nbsp;permanently loses the eye&rsquo;s trust and the
      eye&nbsp;will never attune to it or be convinced by its&nbsp;Deception
      checks.</p>
