      <p>It’s good to learn from your experiences but even better to learn from
      someone else’s. For a guild of thieves with a legacy of control and access
      within a city, these enchanted tools are a truly valuable asset. The
      lockpicks twitch in your hands when they come within 5 feet of a lock they
      have been used to open within the last year. You can use these lockpicks
      and an action to unlock any lock that the lockpicks have previously
      opened.</p><p>Alternatively, you can exhaust the lockpicks’ magic
      completely to borrow a skill or memory from a previous user. You can
      choose to either watch 10 minutes of a previous user’s memory (taken from
      the span of time they had the lockpicks in their possession) or for 10
      minutes you can gain one skill, tool, or language proficiency of the
      previous user. At the end of the duration, the lockpicks rust away to
      nothing.</p><p>Note. The cost listed above is for a relatively recent set
      of lockpicks of memory and at the Narrator’s discretion an older version
      may cost much more.</p>
