      <p>This seemingly empty cloth bag comes in several colors and has a small,
      fuzzy object inside.</p><p>You can use an action to pull a fuzzy object
      from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. Upon landing, it becomes a
      creature determined by a roll on the Bag of Tricks table (depending on the
      bag’s color).</p><p>The resulting creature is friendly to you and any
      companions you have. It acts on your turn, during which you can use a
      bonus action to give it simple commands such as “attack that creature” or
      “move over there”. If the creature dies or if you use the bag again, it
      disappears without a trace. After the first use each day, there is a 50%
      chance that a creature from the bag is hostile instead of friendly and
      obedient.</p><p>Once you have used the bag three times, you cannot do so
      again until the next dawn.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
