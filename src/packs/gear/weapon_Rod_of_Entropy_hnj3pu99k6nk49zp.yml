      <p>This skull-topped rod can be used as a club that grants a +1 bonus
      to&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">attack and damage
      rolls</span>&nbsp;and deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.</p>

      <p>The rod has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges at dawn. As an
      action, you can expend the rod&rsquo;s charges, increasing entropy in a
      15-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15
      Constitution&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">saving
      throw</span>&nbsp;. On a failure, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage per
      charge expended, or half the damage on a success. A creature killed by
      this damage decays and becomes an inanimate skeleton. In addition,
      nonmagical objects in the area that are not being carried or worn
      experience rapid aging. If you expended 1 charge, soft materials like
      leather and cloth rot away, and liquid evaporates. If you expended 2
      charges, hard organic materials like wood and bone crumble, and iron and
      steel rust away. Expending 3 charges causes Medium or smaller stone
      objects to crumble to dust.</p>
