      <p>When you try to unfold this bed sheet-sized knot of spidersilk, you
      occasionally unearth a longdead sparrow or a cricket that waves thanks
      before hopping away. Itâ€™s probably easier just to wad it up and stick it
      in your pocket. The interior of this ball of web is an extradimensional
      space equivalent to a 10-foot cube. To place things into this space you
      must push it into the web, so it cannot hold liquids or gasses. You can
      only retrieve items you know are inside, making it excellent for
      smuggling. Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger
      objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside it. No matter
      how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.</p><p>A creature
      attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed
      on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between long
      rests.</p><p>Any creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed
      into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing
      at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living
      creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and
      appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world.</p>
