      <p>This thick, rune-bedecked tome is packed with arcane schematics and
      mystic instructions for creating a specific kind of guardian either chosen
      by the Narrator or randomly determined.</p><p>Using the manual is
      difficult, and any creature that does not have at least two 5th-level
      spell slots takes 6d6 psychic damage when attempting to read it. To create
      a guardian you must spend the requisite number of days working on the
      guardian (as seen on the Manual of Guardians table) without interruption
      with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. In
      addition, you must pay the requisite cost in materials. </p><p>When the
      guardian has been created, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. After
      sprinkling the book’s ashes on it, the guardian animates under your
      control and obeys your verbal commands.</p><p style="text-align:
