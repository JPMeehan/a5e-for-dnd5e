      <p><em>Wondrous</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>This page of
      nonsense was torn from the diary of someone not well. As you focus on the
      strange symbols they begin to make a strange sort of sense— revealing
      hidden truths about the world.</p><p>You can use an action to study the
      fragment of text to gain an expertise die on an Arcana or History check.
      You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>If instead of
      studying the paper, you can use an action to eat it to automatically
      succeed on an Arcana or History check. You can wait until after making the
      check before deciding to eat the scrap of forbidden text, but you must
      decide before the Narrator says whether the roll succeeds or
      fails.</p><p><strong><em>Curse</em></strong>. This scrap of text is cursed
      and eating it draws the attention of an aberrant creature that seeks you
      out to involve you in its schemes.</p>
