      <p>Mixing lavender petals with herbs creates a natural insect repellent.
      You can use an action to apply the paste to yourself or a willing
      creature, granting immunity to insect-based hazards in swampy terrain. In
      addition, the creature gains benefits equivalent to mosquito netting for
      the next 24 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
