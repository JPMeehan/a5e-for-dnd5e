      origins of this dull gray coin are impossible to identify. Though when
      observed the coin has only two sides, flipping it yields one of 7
      different results.</p><p>You can flip the coin as an action. The effects
      of the flip last for 10 minutes or until you flip the coin
      again.</p><p>Roll a d8 to determine the
      result:</p><ol><li><p><strong><em>Black Sun</em></strong>: Choose one
      warlock cantrip you donâ€™t already know. You know that cantrip for the
      duration.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Broken Temple</em></strong>: You gain
      an expertise die on Wisdom saving
      throws.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Guiding Star</em></strong>: When you
      make an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, you can treat a d20
      roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Lidless
      Eye</em></strong>: You see invisible creatures and objects as if they were
      visible, and you can see into the Ethereal
      Plane.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>New Moon</em></strong>: You have an
      expertise die on Stealth checks.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Pact
      Blade</em></strong>: You gain a +2 bonus to melee attack
      rolls.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Twisted Rod</em></strong>: When you cast
      a spell that deals damage, you can choose to reroll one of the damage
      dice. You must use the second result.</p></li><li><p>The coin folds in on
      itself and disappears forever</p></li></ol>
