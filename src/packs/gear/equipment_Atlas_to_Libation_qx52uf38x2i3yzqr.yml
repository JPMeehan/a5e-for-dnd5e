      <p>This golden-brown parchment has an odd handle-like wooden stave and a
      seal marked with an ale tankard. As a bonus action, you can break the seal
      and unfurl the map. When you do so, the map fills in with accurate
      topography in a 1-mile radius around you. A miniature image of you appears
      at the mapâ€™s center along with a dotted line leading to an X that marks
      the nearest potable alcohol. The map immediately rolls back up if brought
      within 50 feet of alcohol or if no alcohol is within 1 mile when the seal
      is opened.</p><p>Once used in this way, the seal reforms and is usable
      again after 24 hours. </p><p>Alternatively, you can form a cylinder with
      the map and grasp it by the handle as an action. If you do so, the map
      hardens into a tall wooden tankard and magically fills with high quality
      ale, then loses all magical properties and becomes a mundane object.</p>
