      <p>The circular surface of this gleaming silver shield is marked by dents
      and craters making it reminiscent of a full moon. While holding this
      medium shield, you gain a magical +1 bonus to AC. This item has 3 charges
      and regains 1 charge each night at moonrise.</p><p>While this shield is
      equipped, you may expend 1 charge as an action to cast moonbeam, with the
      following exceptions: the spell manifests as a line of moonlight 10 feet
      long and 5 feet wide emanating from the shield, and you may move the beam
      by moving the shield (no action required). When the first charge is
      expended, the shield fades to the shape of a gibbous moon and loses its
      magical +1 bonus to AC. When the second charge is expended, the shield
      fades to the shape of a crescent moon and becomes a light shield, granting
      only a +1 bonus to AC. When the final charge is expended, the shield fades
      away completely, leaving behind its polished silver handle. When the
      shield regains charges, it reforms according to how many charges it has
      remaining.</p>
