      <p><em>Defensive (Medium), Finesse</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p>This weapon first appears to be nothing more than a sword
      hilt.</p><p>While holding the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a
      blade of sunlight appear or disappear.</p><p>Being proficient in
      shortswords or longswords grants proficiency with this magic sword, which
      also has the finesse property as long as the blade is in
      existence.</p><p>While the blade is ignited, you gain +2 bonus to attack
      and damage rolls made with it, dealing 1d8 radiant damage on a hit
      (instead of slashing damage), or 2d8 radiant damage if your target is
      undead.</p><p>The blade shines with bright sunlight in a 15-foot radius
      and dim sunlight for an additional 15 feet.</p><p>You can use an action to
      increase or decrease the bright sunlight and dim sunlight radiuses by 5
      feet, up to a maximum of 30 feet each or down to a minimum of 10 feet
      each.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be used with
      a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When
      you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for
      it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield
      or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.</p>
