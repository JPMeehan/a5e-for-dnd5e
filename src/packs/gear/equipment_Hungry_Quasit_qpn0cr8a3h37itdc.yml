      <p>This Tiny bloodstone is carved in the shape of a grinning, pot-bellied
      quasit. Whenever you would gain temporary hit points, you can choose to
      store them inside the quasit instead. Unlike normal temporary hit points,
      the hit points you store inside the quasit stack, although the maximum
      number of temporary hit points the quasit can hold at one time is equal to
      your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum 1). </p><p>You can
      use an action to activate the quasit and gain all the temporary hit points
      currently stored inside it, which last for up to 1 hour. Whenever you
      activate the quasit, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, you donâ€™t gain
      any temporary hit points, and instead the quasit animates and flies off
      never to be seen again.</p>
