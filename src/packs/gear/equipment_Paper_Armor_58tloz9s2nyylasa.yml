      <p>This heavy, red leather-bound book records the details of an ancient
      war, such as leaders, major battles, defeats, and victories. Alongside the
      factual details are also the personal experiences and notes of one of the
      generals.</p><p>Once per day, as an action, you can hold the open book to
      your chest and quote the first line of the text contained within:
      &ldquo;Wars are won by the prepared.&rdquo; When you do, the book
      transforms, unfolding into what appears to be a full suit of
      parchment-colored plate mail armor over whatever clothes you are wearing.
      You are proficient with this armor as long as you are attuned to this
      item. The fragile nature of this armor means it is destroyed if you are
      fully submerged in water or similar liquid.</p><p>While wearing this
      armor, your Armor Class equals 14 + your Dexterity modifier. Each time you
      take damage, roll 2d20. If you roll 1s on both dice the armor is
      destroyed, leaving behind only scraps of paper. Otherwise, if the total of
      the two dice is less than the damage taken, the armor collapses back into
      a book. The book also folds back up after 1 hour of use or until you use
      an action to quote the last line of the book, &ldquo;In&nbsp;battle, even
      victors suffer death and loss.&rdquo;</p>
