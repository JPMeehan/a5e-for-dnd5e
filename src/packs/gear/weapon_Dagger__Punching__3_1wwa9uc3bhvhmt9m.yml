      This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as
      climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage on
      saving throws made to resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is
      wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket,
      using thievesâ€™ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen
      components.</p>
