      <p>This is an unassuming-looking black umbrella, but it can provide
      impressive protection when needed. As a bonus action when the umbrella is
      open, you can press a button in the handle. The canopy immediately
      flattens and hardens into a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.vf83modl46ytbqgg]{+1 light
      shield} and the handle transforms into a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.6knwjq3586qmvdg4]{+1
      rapier}. You count as already wielding both and are considered proficient
      as long as you are attuned to the defensive umbrella. You can return the
      sword and shield to umbrella form as an action by bringing the two parts
      together and speaking the command word. Opening or closing the umbrella
      requires an action.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to
      be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or
      heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield
      designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with
      your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
