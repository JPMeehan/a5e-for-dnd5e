      <p>This box houses a set of 34 illustrated cards when new. A found deck is
      typically missing 1d20 cards. </p><p>As an action, you can draw a random
      card (one manually selected does nothing) and throw it up to 30 feet from
      you. </p><p>Upon landing, the card creates an illusion of one or more
      creatures. These illusions are of normal size for the creatures depicted
      and act normally, but are insubstantial and harmless. While you are within
      120 feet of the illusion, you can use an action to move it anywhere within
      30 feet from its card. </p><p>The illusions are revealed to a creature
      when it uses an action to make a DC 15 Investigation check or
      automatically upon any physical interaction. Once revealed, an illusion
      becomes translucent. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or it is
      dispelled. In either case the card disappears and cannot be reused. </p>
