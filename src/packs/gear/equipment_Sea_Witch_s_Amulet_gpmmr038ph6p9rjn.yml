      <p><em>Wondrous</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>This locket was
      dredged from the remains of a long-dead sea monster.</p><p>The amulet has
      3 charges.</p><p>While wearing this strange oyster-shaped pendant, you can
      use an action to expend a charge and choose one creature within 30 feet
      that is laughing, singing, or speaking. The target makes a DC 15 Wisdom
      saving throw or you steal its voice.</p><p>As long as you are wearing the
      amulet, you can speak with the target’s voice.</p><p>For as long as you
      possess a target’s voice in the amulet, the target is unable to speak. At
      the end of every 24 hours, the amulet expends 1 charge per voice stored
      inside of it. When the amulet has no charges to expend, the stolen voice
      is released and returns to the target.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to
      release a voice stored in the amulet. When the amulet has no voices stored
      in it and is soaked in sea water for 24 hours, it regains 1
      charge.</p><p>Destroying the amulet releases any stolen voices stored
      inside and creates a brief piercing shriek in a 100-foot radius. Each
      creature in the area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be
      stunned until the start of its next turn.</p>
