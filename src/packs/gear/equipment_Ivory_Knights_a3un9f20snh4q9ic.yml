      <p>These two ivory figurines look as though they belong with a chess set.
      If you and one other person hold one of the knights, you can use an action
      to whisper in the ear of the game piece to communicate with the creature
      holding the other (as the <em>message</em> cantrip). </p><p>If you and the
      person carrying the other figurine hold your game pieces to your hearts
      while within 120 feet of each other, you share a remembrance of two
      outmatched knights rushing into battle. Within the next minute, each of
      you can use an action once to teleport to any point between your current
      positions. You each can teleport once, after which the figurines lose
      their power.</p>
