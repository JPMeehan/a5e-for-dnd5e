      <blockquote><p>This durable device provides tactical mobility without
      requiring use of the legs.</p></blockquote><p>While mounted on a
      wheelchair you are considered to be wearing the wheelchair as a piece of
      gear. The wheelchair is mechanically complex, and can ascend stairs and
      ramps slowly, or provide a boost of speed on the descent. You have a
      movement speed of 30 feet while mounted on a wheelchair and treat inclines
      and stairs as difficult terrain, but while moving down slopes, stairs, or
      other significant declines you may take the Dash action as a bonus
      action.</p><p>At the Narratorâ€™s discretion, more advanced and tactical
      wheelchairs may be available.</p>
