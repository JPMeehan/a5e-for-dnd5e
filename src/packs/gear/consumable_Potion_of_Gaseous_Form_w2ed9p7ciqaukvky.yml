    value: >-
      <p>The pale, translucent liquid in this vial causes the flask to float
      slightly. After drinking this potion, for the next hour you are affected
      as if you had cast <em>gaseous form</em> (but without the need for
      concentration ).</p><p>You can use a bonus action to end the effect
      early.</p>
