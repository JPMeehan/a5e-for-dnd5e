      <p>This small necklace bears a flame idol&mdash;like the birthmark that
      Milton Fremont had upon his hand&mdash;made of silver hanging from a
      silver chain.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Banish the Dark.</strong></em> While you are within 500
      miles of the island of Flame&rsquo;s Rest and have an unobstructed line of
      effect to the Silver Flame, you can use a bonus action to grasp the
      necklace and point it at an area of darkness you can see that is up to 20
      feet in radius. The area of darkness becomes brightly lit for the next
      minute and the darkness is dispelled.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use this property while not able to access the
      Silver Flame. Once you have used this property in that way, you cannot do
      so again until the next dawn.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Silver Essence.</strong></em> While wearing this necklace,
      your melee and ranged weapon attacks are considered to be both magical and
      silvered.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Silver Light.</strong></em> This trinket shines with silver
      light in a 15-foot radius and dim silver light for an additional 15 feet.
      You can use an action to increase or decrease the light and dim light
      radiuses by 5 feet, up to a maximum of 30 feet each or down to a minimum
      of 10 feet each.</p>
