      <p><em>Wondrous</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Many humanoid
      races have darkvision but some find that this curious lantern (which can
      be a hooded lantern or bullseye lantern) is worth carrying all the same,
      particularly scholars and spies who often need the finest possible detail
      without revealing themselves to others.</p><p>When you light this lantern,
      you can expend 1 charge to shed second-light. Second-light is visible only
      to creatures with darkvision and they see the full range of colors in
      things illuminated by it.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 1d4 charges
      to shed a still more specialized light, visible only to those who are
      touching the lanternâ€™s handle. This light lasts for a number of minutes
      equal to the charges expended.</p><p>The lantern has 4 charges and regains
      1 charge each dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result
      of 5 or less, the lantern loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
