      spellcaster</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><em>Requires attunement by
      a spellcaster</em></p><p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to
      expend 1 charge to force a creature within 60 feet to make a DC 15
      Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed
      creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      ending the effect on itself on success.</p><p>This wand has 7 charges and
      regains [[/r 1d6+1 #charges]] expended charges each dawn. When the last
      charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]]. On a 1, the wand shatters into
      hundreds of pieces.</p>
