      <p>A typical enchanted <em>crystal ball</em> can be used to cast the
      <em>scrying</em> spell (save DC 17) once between short rests while
      touching it.</p><p>Three legendary variations exist. In all cases, the
      legendary variants have an alignment (Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful). If
      you do not have an alignment trait that matches the crystal ball’s, after
      using it you take 6d6 psychic damage and gain a level of
      strife.</p><p>While the scrying is active, you can communicate
      telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor, and
      you can use an action to cast <em>suggestion</em> (save DC 17) through the
      sensor on one of them. This effect does not require concentration, but it
      ends when the scrying does.</p>
