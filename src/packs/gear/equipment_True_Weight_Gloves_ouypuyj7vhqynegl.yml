      <p>This set of emerald green gloves are made from velvet with very fine
      silk stitching and function as a small scale.</p><p>While wearing them,
      you can hold two objects in your hands and know the exact weight of the
      objects. The objects must be of a size and weight that allow you to hold
      your arms straight out with one in each open palm.</p><p>While using the
      gloves to weigh objects, you can speak a command word that makes them
      disappear in a puff of green smoke if either object is counterfeit.</p>
