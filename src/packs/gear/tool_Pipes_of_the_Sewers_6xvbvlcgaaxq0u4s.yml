      <p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use&nbsp;these pipes.
      The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3&nbsp;expended charges at
      dawn.</p><p>You can use an action to expend 1 to 3 charges and play the
      pipes, summoning a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.4t45jjv5qgpddyax]{Swarm of Rats}
      for each expended charge. Summoned swarms are not under anyone&rsquo;s
      control and appear by the shortest available route, and if there are not
      enough rats within a half mile (at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion) for
      this to take effect the expended charges are wasted and no swarm is
      summoned.</p><p>While you are using an action to play the pipes,&nbsp;you
      can make a Charisma check contested by the&nbsp;Wisdom check of a swarm of
      rats within 30 feet. On&nbsp;a failure, the swarm acts normally and is
      immune&nbsp;to the pipes for 24 hours. On a success, the
      swarm&nbsp;becomes friendly to you and your allies until you
      stop&nbsp;playing the pipes, following your commands. If not&nbsp;given
      any commands a friendly swarm defends itself&nbsp;but otherwise takes no
      actions. Any friendly swarm&nbsp;that begins its turn unable to hear music
      from the&nbsp;pipes breaks your control, behaving as normal
      and&nbsp;immune to the effects of the pipes for 24 hours.</p>
