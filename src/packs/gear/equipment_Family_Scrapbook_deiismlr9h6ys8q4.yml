      <p>This scrapbook contains the legacy of campaigns undertaken by
      adventurers in days past. When in need of advice, you can open the
      leather-bound tome and spend 1 minute looking for a similar
      situation.</p><p><strong><em>Roll a
      d10:</em></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>7-10</strong>: you learn one fact
      relevant to the situation.</p></li><li><p><strong>1-6</strong>: you
      instead learn one fact or piece of advice that is irrelevant to the
      situation (such as “<em>a group of tigers is called an ambush</em>,” or
      “<em>you should eat more leafy greens</em>”).</p></li></ul><p>Once you
      have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to rapidly find one
      tale of questing relevant to your situation and rip it out of the
      book.</p><blockquote><p><em>Choose one 1st-level spell that has a casting
      time of 1 action from any class spell list. Before the end of your next
      turn, you can cast this spell without the need for material
      components.</em></p></blockquote><p>After a page is torn from the tome in
      this way, it becomes a mundane scrapbook.</p>
