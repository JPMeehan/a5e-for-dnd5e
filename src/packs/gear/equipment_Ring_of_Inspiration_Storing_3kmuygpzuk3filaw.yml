      <p>Sages and scholars argue about the nature&nbsp;of these rings, their
      very existence as much&nbsp;a mystery as the creatures that
      supposedly&nbsp;forged them. Though all of them look
      slightly&nbsp;different, at their core is a strand of destiny&nbsp;spun by
      a&nbsp;fateholder</span>&nbsp;to subtly empower and&nbsp;guide its
      pawns.</p><p>This ring stores inspiration and holds it for&nbsp;later use.
      While wearing this ring, you can&nbsp;choose to gain and use the
      inspiration stored&nbsp;within it. Once the inspiration is used, it is
      no&nbsp;longer stored within the ring.</p><p>When found, the ring contains
      1d4 &ndash; 1&nbsp;inspiration, as determined by the Narrator.&nbsp;The
      ring can store up to 4 inspiration at a&nbsp;time. To store inspiration, a
      creature with&nbsp;inspiration spends a&nbsp;<span>short rest&nbsp;wearing
      the&nbsp;ring and chooses to bestow it. The inspiration&nbsp;has no
      immediate effect.</p><p>In addition, whenever inspiration from within the
      ring is used the Narrator may choose to grant a vision of possible future
      events of great import.</p>
