      <p>You gain +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      sword. In addition, while you are attuned to the sword, on each of your
      turns before you make your first attack with it you can transfer some or
      all of the +3 bonus to your Armor Class (instead of using it for attacks)
      until the start of your next turn or until you drop the sword (whichever
      comes first)</p>.<hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be
      used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or
      heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield
      designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with
      your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p><p><b>Mounted:</b> This weapon deals the damage listed in
      parenthesis when you are wielding it while mounted.</p>
