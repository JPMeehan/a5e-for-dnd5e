      <p>You can use an action to splash the contents of this flask on an
      adjacent creature. Alternatively, you can throw it up to 20 feet where it
      shatters on impact. Make a ranged weapon attack against a target creature,
      treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend
      or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage and becomes slowed until the end of
      your next turn.</p><p>A cleric or herald can create holy water by
      performing a special ritual that takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth
      of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell
      slot.</p>
