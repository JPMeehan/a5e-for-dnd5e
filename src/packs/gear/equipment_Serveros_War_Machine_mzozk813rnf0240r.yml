      <p>In size and shape this massive construct is not unlike&nbsp;a squat
      hill giant&mdash;if hill giants were made of metal, leather, wood, and
      glass. With all manner of wheels,&nbsp;gears, cables, and hinges, when
      worn its movements&nbsp;are surprisingly fluid, if somewhat loud and
      heavy.</p><p>The last of its kind, the Serveros War Engine was used by a
      forgotten empire&rsquo;s soldiers in wars that spread far beyond their
      kingdom. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine there may once have been entire armies
      outfitted with these magical constructs and engaged in battle against one
      another, and impossible to conceive of the untold destruction they
      wrought.</p><p>Mounting the war engine is a fairly straight forward
      matter. As you enter the construct, you can don a helm and belt, both
      connected to the war engine, which allow you to attune to and control the
      construct. The construct is not sentient and moves only when controlled in
      this way.</p><p>When controlling the construct, you form a psychic bond
      with it, seeing through its eyes, moving with its limbs, and experiencing
      pain through its body.</p><h2>Legends and Lore</h2><p>Success on an Arcana
      or History check reveals&nbsp;the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong>
      This is the Serveros War Engine, the last war machine of a forgotten
      empire.</p><p><strong>DC 18</strong> The engine is piloted from inside,
      and only those with mental and physical fortitude can endure it. In
      addition to offering great might, it can manifest arcane blades, cannons,
      and other effects.</p><p><strong>DC 21</strong> Destroying the engine
      requires destroying the helm, which is heavily enchanted with
      fortifications against harm.</p><h2>Artifact Properties</h2><p>The
      Serveros War Engine has one lesser artifact&nbsp;benefit. Piloting the war
      engine can be quite taxing,&nbsp;both mentally and physically. You gain no
      benefits&nbsp;from a long or short rest while mounted in the
      war&nbsp;engine, and when you expend its last available charge&nbsp;you
      suffer both a level of fatigue and strife.</p><p>While you are attuned to,
      mounted inside, and controlling the Serveros War Engine, you gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your AC becomes 18.</li><li>Your Strength
      score becomes 21.</li><li>You are Huge-sized.</li><li>Your Speed becomes
      40 feet.</li><li>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid being
      grappled or knocked prone.</li><li>You sustain only 1 hit point of damage
      for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
      damage dealt to you.</li><li>Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning
      damage.</li><li>Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of
      overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.</li><li>You have
      disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</li><li>You are vulnerable to
      psychic damage.</li></ul><h2>Charged Properties</h2><p>The war engine also
      has several built-in features,&nbsp;some of which are powered by stored
      electrical&nbsp;charges or drain energy from your life force.</p><ul><li>A
      massive sword hilt is secured to the&nbsp;construct&rsquo;s hip by an
      incredible magnetic&nbsp;force. You can use a bonus action to
      either&nbsp;expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force&nbsp;damage to draw the
      hilt and engage its plasma blade.<ul><li><em><strong>Plasma
      Blade.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
      18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two
      hands.</li></ul></li><li>An arcane cannon is housed in the
      construct&rsquo;s&nbsp;left forearm. You can use an action or
      bonus&nbsp;action to either expend 1 charge or take 5&nbsp;(2d4) force
      damage to fire the arcane cannon.<ul><li><em><strong>Arcane
      Cannon.</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> range 120/300 ft., one target.
      Hit: 7 (2d6) radiant damage.</li></ul></li><li>The construct&rsquo;s right
      hand is detachable.&nbsp;You can use an action and either expend
      1&nbsp;charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire&nbsp;the gauntlet as a
      projectile.<ul><li><em><strong>Gauntlet Grapple.</strong> Ranged Weapon
      Attack:</em> range 60/120 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning
      damage, or 8 (1d6+5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or
      smaller creature it is grappled. You can use a bonus action to retract the
      hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target
      moves with the hand.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Serveros War Engine begins
      with [[1d20]] charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check,
      2d10 charges can be restored during a long rest.</p><h2>Warframe
      Variations</h2><p>The Narrator may apply one or more of the&nbsp;following
      variant options if desired.</p><p><em><strong>Airborne.</strong></em> You
      can expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to unfold magical wings
      and gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1
      minute.</p><p><em><strong>Disrepair.</strong></em> When first discovered,
      the Serveros War Engine may be completely depleted of stored charges and
      heavily damaged, or perhaps almost completely dismantled. With
      maintenance, care, and careful reconstruction using Engineering (or a wish
      spell), it can be restored to its full, terrible
      power.</p><p><em><strong>Glass Jaw.</strong></em> When the Serveros War
      Engine takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning damage,
      roll a d20. On a 1, the war engine&rsquo;s head is knocked off, disabling
      the artifact until it is repaired with a DC 23 Intelligence (Engineering)
      check and 8 hours of work.</p><p><em><strong>Mortal Echoes.</strong></em>
      The Serveros War Engine&rsquo;s last pilot died while mounted within the
      war engine, and echoes of their psyche still linger within the construct.
      When first attempting to attune to the artifact, you relive the final
      moments of the dead pilot and make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a
      failure, you take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and gain a short-term mental
      stress effect.</p><p><em><strong>Nautical.</strong></em> You gain a swim
      speed of 40 feet. In addition, you can use an action to either expend 1
      charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to seal the cockpit and fill it with
      breathable air which lasts for 1
      hour.</p><p><em><strong>Recon.</strong></em> You gain darkvision to a
      range of 60 feet and can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force
      damage to activate magical floating discs on the soles of the
      construct&rsquo;s feet. The discs last for 1 hour during which time the
      construct does not cause you to have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
      checks and you leave no tracks on the ground.</p><p><em><strong>Serveros
      Slayer.</strong></em> In lieu of the arcane cannon and detachable fist,
      the construct is equipped with a psyblade in each hand. You can use a
      bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to
      deploy one or both psyblades.</p><p style="text-align:
      center;"><em><strong>Psyblade.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 10
      ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) psychic
      damage.</p><p><em><strong>Specialized Weaponry.</strong></em> Instead of a
      giant&nbsp;plasma sword, the Serveros War Engine has one&nbsp;of the
      following weapons. You can use a bonus&nbsp;action and either expend 1
      charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to equip and activate the
      weapon.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Discus Throwing
      Shield.</strong> Melee or Ranged&nbsp;Weapon Attack:</em> reach 5 ft. or
      range 40/80 ft.,&nbsp;one target, or if thrown two targets within
      10&nbsp;feet of each other. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning&nbsp;damage.</p><p
      style="text-align: center;">In addition, while the shield is donned your
      AC increases by 2.</p><p style="text-align:
      center;"><em><strong>Extendable Metal Staff.</strong> Melee Weapon
      Attack:</em> reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning, or 18
      (3d8+5) bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands, and a Large or
      smaller target makes a DC 18 Strength saving throw or is knocked
      prone.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Shocking
      Net.</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> range 30/60 ft., all targets in a
      15-foot square area. Hit: 9 (2d8) lightning damage and the target is
      grappled. At the start of your turn, conscious creatures grappled by the
      net take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. This weapon cannot damage a creature
      with 0 hit points.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Sonic War
      Hammer.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
      18 (3d8+5) thunder damage, or 21 (3d10+5) thunder damage when wielded with
      two hands.</p><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><h2>Destroying the
      War Engine</h2><p>Of all its various parts and components the key
      to&nbsp;disabling and ultimately destroying the war engine&nbsp;is the
      helm. The rest of the massive construct might&nbsp;feasibly be replaced or
      reengineered by an ingenious&nbsp;mind. However with its complex
      structure, both&nbsp;magical and mechanical, replicating the
      controller&nbsp;headpiece requires arcane knowledge and
      technical&nbsp;documentation that disappeared with the
      war&nbsp;engine&rsquo;s creators long ago.</p><p>The helm is heavily
      enchanted with fortifications against harm. Bypassing its magical
      protections requires two steps: first, a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel Magic}
      cast at 5th-level or higher is needed to make the invisible barrier around
      the war engine&rsquo;s helm vulnerable for 6 seconds, followed by a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.suktewdv0zo7rgd0]{Disintegrate} spell
      cast at 7th-level or higher to completely dissolve the barrier. Once the
      barrier is dissolved, for the next 24 hours the helm can be destroyed like
      any other item (AC 22, 100 hit points) before its magical protections
      regenerate and fully repair it.</p>
