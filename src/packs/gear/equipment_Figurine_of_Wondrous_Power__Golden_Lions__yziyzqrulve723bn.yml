    value: >-
      <p>These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire
      gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and
      some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.</p><p>The
      specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the
      same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and
      throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living
      creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is
      occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does
      not transform.</p><p>It understands any language you can speak and follows
      your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends
      itself but does not otherwise act.</p><p>Each creature stays transformed
      for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of
      this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also
      reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak
      the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine
      form, it cannot transform again for a specific length of time.</p><hr
