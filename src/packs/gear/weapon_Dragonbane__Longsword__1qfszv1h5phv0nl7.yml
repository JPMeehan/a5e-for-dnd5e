      <p><em>Requires attunement by a creature wearing the sword's
      scabbard</em></p><p>This double-sided blade is made of red-hued iron and
      is engraved with Draconic runes that glow crimson when near a true dragon.
      The hilt is made of blackened iron and wrapped with red silver wire, the
      pommel shaped like the head of a red dragon.</p><p>This family greatsword
      is the property of Lord Pemberton. The scabbard was lost decades ago in
      Brockendale Castle when the Pembertons&rsquo; ancestors fled. Since then
      most believe it to be a family legend&mdash;a colorful story, but nothing
      more.</p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this
      greatsword. When used against a dragon, you instead gain a +3 bonus to
      attack and damage rolls, and deal an extra 3d6 slashing damage. When the
      blade scores a critical hit against a dragon, the dragon head on its
      pommel glows with fury, dealing an extra 3d10 radiant
      damage.</p><p>Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws made to
      resist the attacks and traits of dragons (including breath weapons, roars,
      and even spells if a dragon can cast them).</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b>
      This weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or
      lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this
      weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action
      to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by
      1 until the start of your next turn.</p>
