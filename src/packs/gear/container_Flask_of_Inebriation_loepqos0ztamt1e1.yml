      <p>This plain and rough old steel flask hides oneâ€™s vices most
      inconspicuously.</p><p>Any liquid poured into the flask instantly becomes
      intoxicating and remains so even if poured out of the flask.</p><p>The
      flask has no effect on any form of magical liquids poured into
      it.</p><p>You can use an action to expend 1 charge, spraying a 10-foot
      cone that empties the flask of its contents. Creatures within the area
      make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or are poisoned by the potent
      alcohol. At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned by the flask
      can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p><p>The flask has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each
      dawn.</p><p>If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or
      less, the flask loses its potency and becomes a mundane item.</p>
