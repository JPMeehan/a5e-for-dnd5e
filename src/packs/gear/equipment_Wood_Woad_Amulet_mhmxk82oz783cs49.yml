      <p><strong>Crafting Components: </strong>Wooden road sign stolen from a
      crossroads</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <p>This wooden amulet painted with blue pigment is carved to resemble a
      humanoid figure armed with a club and shield. Its face is featureless
      apart from two empty eyes that glow with a faint yellow light. When you
      hold it to your ear, you hear faint whispers. Once a day as an action, you
      can hold the amulet to your ear and listen to its whispers to guide you.
      You gain an expertise die to one ability check made in the next minute.
      You may roll the expertise die before or after making the ability check,
      after which the effect ends. This ability recharges at dusk each day.</p>

      <p>Additionally you may crush the amulet as a reaction, destroying it to
      free the spirit within and gain the &lsquo;woad&rsquo;s blessing&rsquo;.
      You can expend the woad&rsquo;s blessing to roll an additional d20 when
      you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, and choose which
      of the d20s is used. You can roll the additional die after making the
      roll, but before the outcome is determined. Once you have used the
      woad&rsquo;s blessing, the amulet&rsquo;s magic dissipates. </p>
