      <p>This slender timber wand has a wooden ring at its tip. The wand has 7
      charges and regains 1d6+1 charges each dawn. If you expend the last
      charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into a spray of colorful
      bubbles and is lost forever.</p><p>While holding the wand, you can use an
      action to expend its charges and either create a harmless spray of
      colorful bubbles (1 charge) or cast the dancing lights cantrip (2
      charges). The dancing lights appear as glowing bubbles.</p><p>When a
      creature targets you with an attack while you are holding the wand, you
      can use your reaction to snap it (destroying the wand). You can do this
      after the roll is made, but before the outcome of the attack is
      determined. You gain a +5 bonus to AC and a fly speed of 10 ft. as a giant
      soap bubble coalesces around you. The bubble persists for 1 minute or
      until you are hit with an attack, at which point it bursts with a loud
      ‘pop’.</p>
