      <p>This miniature private correspondence, which smells of floral perfume,
      is proof of a particularly scandalous dalliance between two noble fey
      which you can exploit for a favor. While attuned to the letter you can
      whisper the command word to cast either <em>druidcraft </em>or
      <em>mending</em>. You canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use an action to summon a Tiny faerie
      (AC 15, HP 1, Speed fly 30 ft., spell save DC 12). The faerie is charmed
      by you and acts immediately, casting one of the following spells as
      directed: <em>faerie fire</em>, <em>healing word</em>, or <em>hideous
      laughter</em>, after which it acts to preserve its own life and will only
      take the Dodge or Hide actions. If the faerie dies in your service the
      letter loses its power, but you retain the proof of their misconduct.
      Otherwise the faerie disappears after 1 minute, taking its love letter
      with it.</p>
