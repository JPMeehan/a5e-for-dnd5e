      <p>The days of wondering what the socialites across the room are chatting
      about have come to an end! This brass earring is sculpted into the shape
      of whispering maidens.</p><p>Whenever a creature says your name while
      within 100 feet the earring activates, transmitting the creatureâ€™s words
      as a hushed whisper into your ears until it has gone at least 1 minute
      without saying your name.</p>
