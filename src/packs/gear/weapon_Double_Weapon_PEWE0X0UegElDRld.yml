      <p>Wielded not unlike a quarterstaff, each side of this weapon has a
      blade, weighted head, or other injurious implement. Most double weapons
      are two-bladed swords or double-axes, but there have been gnome warriors
      known to wield hooked hammers and elvish clades specialized in
      swordspears. Double weapons use the statistics for whichever weapon is
      used to attack and are considered to have the dual-wielding and parrying
      properties.</p><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and
      you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
