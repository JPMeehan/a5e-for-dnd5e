      <p>This fine wire mesh bag is reinforced with metal beams, making a
      durable but flexible enclosure. Creatures of an appropriate size can
      comfortably reside within the enclosure if provided with some appropriate
      substrate (soft bedding for rodents, loamy soil for toads, and so
      on).</p><p>Tiny: A single Tiny creature residing within the enclosure has
      total cover while inside it and automatically succeeds on saving throws to
      resist area effects.</p>
