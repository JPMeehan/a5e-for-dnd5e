      <p>Any instrument can be played for coin. Doing so requires a public space
      with at least 10 people, or an official gig at an establishment with a
      musical venue like a tavern or club. In either case make a check using
      your instrument for each hour you spend performing and consult Table:
      Performance Outcomes to determine the amount of gold you receive, though
      you may receive more or less than that at specific musical venues at the
      Narrator’s discretion. Bards can also use musical instruments as a
      spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate
      proficiency.</p><p>TABLE: PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES</p><p>PERFORMANCE CHECK
