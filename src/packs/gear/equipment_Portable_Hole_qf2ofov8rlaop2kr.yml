      <p>While not in use, this item appears as a cloth the&nbsp;color of
      darkness. When unfolded, it opens up into&nbsp;a circular sheet that is 6
      feet in diameter.</p><p>You can use an action to unfold the portable hole
      on a stable solid surface. When unfolded, the item creates a hole 10 feet
      deep that leads to a cylindrical extra dimensional space which cannot be
      used to create open passages. Closing the hole requires an action and
      involves you taking a hold of the edges and folding it up. No matter its
      contents, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p><p>Food or water placed in a
      closed portable hole immediately and permanently lose all nourishing
      qualities&mdash;after being in the item, water no longer slakes thirst and
      food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a
      dead creature placed in the portable hole cannot be restored to life by
      revivify, raise dead, or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside a
      closed portable hole can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the
      number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to
      suffocate.</p><p>Creatures inside the hole while it&rsquo;s open can exit
      the hole by simply climbing out. A creature still within the hole can use
      an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to escape as it is being closed.
      On a success, the creature appears within 5 feet of the item or creature
      carrying it.</p><p>Placing a portable hole inside another extradimensional
      storage device such as a
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.yytjmrjkh1qhwrtb]{Bag of
      Holding} or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.zky1yh7ac8imuvni]{Handy
      Haversack} results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls
      everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and
      disappears.</p>
