      <p>Message stones are a pair of small, smooth stones, carved from two
      halves of a single rock. While touching one of the stones, you can use an
      action to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.kbyg7uvh3w8osgiq]{Sending},
      targeting the creature that carries the other stone. The spell is only
      cast if a creature is holding the paired stone or it is otherwise touching
      the creature&rsquo;s skin.</p>

      <p>Once used to cast sending, the stones cannot be used again until dawn
      of the following day. If one of the paired stones is destroyed, the other
      loses its magical properties. </p>
