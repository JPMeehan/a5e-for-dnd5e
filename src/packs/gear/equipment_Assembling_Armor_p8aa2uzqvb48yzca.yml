    value: >-
      <p>This thick leather belt pouch jingles softly as if filled with metal
      rings. This item has 6 charges and regains 1d4 each dawn.</p><p>You can
      use an action to speak one of three command words and expend 1 or more of
      the pouch’s charges, causing metal rings and plates to stream out of the
      pouch and assemble into a suit of armor on your body.</p><p>• Leather
      brigandine (1 charge)</p><p>• Half plate (2 charges)</p><p>• Full plate (3
      charges)</p><p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to speak a fourth
      command word and expend 1 charge to summon a medium shield from the
      pouch.</p><p>If you are already wearing armor that provides equal or
      greater protection than the armor provided by the pouch, the charges are
      wasted and nothing happens. If you are wearing armor that provides Trials
      &amp; Treasures 216 less protection, the assembling armor reinforces the
      armor you are already wearing and you benefit from the same level of
      protection as if you activated the pouch while unarmored. The armor
      remains on your person for up to 1 hour or until you use an action to
      dismiss it, after which it disassembles and returns to the pouch.</p>
