      <p>You can sit astride this ordinary-seeming 3 pound broom and speak its
      command word, causing it to hover. While it is hovering you can ride the
      broom to fly through the air. The broom can carry up to 200 pounds at a
      speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed of 20 feet. It stops
      hovering if you land.</p><p>You can send the broom up to 1 mile from you
      by speaking its command word and naming a location you are familiar with.
      It can also be called back from up to a mile away with a different command
      word.</p>
