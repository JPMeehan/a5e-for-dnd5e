      <p>This greataxe is macabre in design, bearing a black axehead that seems
      to shimmer in darkness and a solid white handle that feels like ironhard
      bone that&rsquo;s always cool to the touch. You gain a +1 bonus on attack
      and damage rolls using this greataxe.</p>

      <p>Once you have attuned to black axe, it gains the following
      properties.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Black Blight.</strong></em> Necrotic damage dealt by this
      greataxe ignores damage resistance . A target immune to necrotic damage
      takes half damage from necrotic damage dealt by black axe.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Dark Hunger.</strong></em> While you are bloodied and
      wielding this greataxe, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack
      against a living creature within your reach. On a hit, you deal an extra
      2d8 necrotic damage, gaining temporary hit points equal to the necrotic
      damage dealt.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Flesheater.</strong></em> You can use an action to touch
      black axe against the corpse of a Medium-sized or smaller creature. The
      greataxe consumes all of the corpse&rsquo;s blood, bones, and flesh to
      leave only the items it was wearing. Once you have used this property a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you must finish a long
      rest before it can be used again.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Curse: Bloodlust.</strong></em> You are unwilling to part
      with the greataxe, and you have disadvantage on attacks made against
      non-bloodied creatures when a living enemy within 30 feet of you is
      bloodied.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b> This weapon deals double damage to
      unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies
      to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis
      after this property.</p>
