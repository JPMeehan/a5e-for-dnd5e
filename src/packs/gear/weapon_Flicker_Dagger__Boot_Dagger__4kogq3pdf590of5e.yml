      u-my-md"><p>At a glance this item seems to be perfectly typical, but it
      conceals a spring-loaded blade deployed by pressing a switch when it is
      used to make an attack.</p><p>A creature observing it only realizes that
      the item is a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with
      disadvantage if the weapon is being worn at the time and not
      deployed).</p><p>Once deployed, a bonus action is required to re-sheathe
      the blade. You gain an expertise die on your attack roll when you deploy
      this weapon as part of an attack against a target that is unaware you have
      it.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While you are attuned to and
      wielding this dagger, you can use a bonus action to summon a flickering
      illusion for 1 minute.</p><p>Your flickering illusion shares your space,
      moves with you, and is treated as another enemy of the target for the
      purposes of the Sneak Attack feature, but it cannot be targeted with
      attacks and provides no penalties to creatures attacking you.</p><p>Once
      you have used this property, you cannot do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p><hr><p><b>Stealthy:</b> This armor or weapon has been
      disguised to look like a piece of clothing or other normal item. A
      creature observing the item only realizes that it is armor or a weapon
      with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the armor is
      being worn at the time or the weapon is sheathed).</p>
