    value: >-
      <p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      sword, and it ignores resistance to slashing damage.</p><p>When you attack
      a creature with this blade and it has at least one head, rolling a natural
      20 on the attack roll causes the sword to make a snicker-snack sound as it
      efficiently chops off one of the target's heads. If the creature can't
      survive without its head removed, it dies. This effect does not apply if
      the target is too big for its head to be removed by the sword (determined
      at the discretion of the Narrator, it doesn't need a head or have one, has
      immunity to slashing damage, or has legendary actions. In cases where a
      creature cannot lose a head, it takes an additional 6d8 slashing damage
      (unless it is immune to slashing damage; this extra damage does not
      double).</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be used
      with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy).
      When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed
      for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your
      shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
