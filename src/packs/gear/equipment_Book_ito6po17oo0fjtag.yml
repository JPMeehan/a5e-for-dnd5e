      <p>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information
      pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish
      contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using
      text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this
      section). Any book of masterwork quality covers in detail one specialty.
      You gain an expertise die on checks made regarding the specialty detailed
      in the last masterwork book youâ€™ve read.</p>
