      <p><strong>Vicious Weapon:&nbsp;</strong>When you roll a natural 20 on an
      attack roll using this weapon it deals an extra 2d6 damage of the
      weapon&rsquo;s type (this extra damage does not
      double).</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be used
      with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy).
      When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed
      for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your
      shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and you are
      not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise
      die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by a
      creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p><p><b>Vicious:</b> A
      vicious weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already
      have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your
      critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17â€“20).</p>
