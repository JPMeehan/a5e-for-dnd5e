    value: >-
      <p>You gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic axe,
      and while you are attuned to it your hit point maximum is increased by 1
      for each level you have attained. </p><p><strong>Curse.</strong> After you
      attune to this axe you are unwilling to part with it, keeping it within
      reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls
      with weapons other than this one unless the nearest foe you are aware of
      is 60 feet or more away from you.</p><p>In addition, when you are damaged
      by a hostile creature you make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk.
      While berserk, on your turn each round you move to the nearest creature
      and take the Attack action against it, moving to attack the next nearest
      creature after you incapacitate your current target. When there is more
      than one possible target, you randomly determine which to attack. You
      continue to be berserk until there are no creatures you can see or hear
      within 60 feet of you at the start of your turn.</p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b>
      This weapon deals double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and
      walls. If this property only applies to a specific type of material, such
      as wood, it is stated in parenthesis after this property.</p>
