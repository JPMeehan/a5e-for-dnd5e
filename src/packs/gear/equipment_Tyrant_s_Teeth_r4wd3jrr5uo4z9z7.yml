      <blockquote><p>You can only attune to this item if you have survived being
      bitten by a Huge or larger reptile or dragon.</p></blockquote><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Dagger-sharp fangs ripped from the skull of a
      tyrant lizard clatter around this necklace’s cord.</p><p>When you attack
      while wearing it, a ghostly reptilian head appears and snaps down on your
      target.</p><p>While wearing this item your footsteps make the ground
      tremble slightly and you have disadvantage on Stealth checks.</p><p>When
      you take energy damage, your attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same
      type until the end of your next turn. If you are damaged by multiple
      energy types, you only deal bonus damage of the most recent
      type.</p><p>Once per day, when you hit with a melee attack you can use a
      bonus action to create a spectral tyrannosaur that bites the target,
      dealing 4d6 force damage.</p>
