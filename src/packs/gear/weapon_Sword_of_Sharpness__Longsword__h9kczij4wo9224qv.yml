      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Objects hit with this sword take the
      maximum damage the weapon’s damage dice can deal.</p><p>When you use this
      sword to make an attack against a creature and roll a natural 20, the
      target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage.</p><p>Then roll an additional
      d20, and on a natural 20 you chop off one of the target’s limbs (or a
      portion of its body if it has no limbs). The Narrator determines what
      effect (if any) the result of this severing off is.</p><p>You may also
      speak this sword’s command word to make the blade emit bright light in a
      10-foot radius and dim light an additional 10 feet. Repeating the command
      word or sheathing the sword extinguishes the blade’s
      light.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be used with
      a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When
      you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for
      it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield
      or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.</p>
