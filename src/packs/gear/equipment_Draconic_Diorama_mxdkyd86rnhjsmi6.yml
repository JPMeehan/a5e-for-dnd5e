      <p>This Tiny diorama is contained within a cube-shaped box 5 inches on
      each side. The bottom is lead and the rest made of transparent crystal.
      Inside the box there are several trees made of paper and wire, a treasure
      chest made of clay, and a 1 1/2-inch dragon skeleton. The skeleton stands
      in a different position each time the box is examined but it does not move
      while being observed. </p><p>While you carry the diorama, you have
      advantage on saving throws against Frightful Presence. </p><p>A successful
      DC 13 Arcana or Nature check reveals the skeleton is an actual dragon
      skeleton that has been shrunk to fit inside the box.
      </p><p><em>Curse.</em> While carrying the cursed diorama you are compelled
      to amass more wealth. As long as you are compelled, you must succeed on a
      DC 13 Charisma saving throw to willingly part with the diorama, even
      temporarily.</p>
