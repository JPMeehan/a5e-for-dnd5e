      <p>Five<em>&nbsp;dark stones</em>&nbsp;are usually found together.
      A&nbsp;<em>dark stone</em>&nbsp;is a black, round pebble that is cold to
      the touch. It can be used as sling ammunition or can be thrown up to 30
      feet. If it is used as sling ammunition, a target hit by the stone takes
      an extra 1d6 cold damage. Whether it is fired or thrown, nonmagical fires
      within 10 feet of the stone&rsquo;s point of impact are immediately
      extinguished, as are any magical lights or fires created with a spell slot
      of 2nd-level or lower.</p>
