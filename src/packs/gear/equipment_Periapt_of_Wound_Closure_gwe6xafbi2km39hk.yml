      <p>Engraved with symbols of healing, this warm silver&nbsp;pendant
      prevents you from dying.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>While wearing this pendant, you automatically stabilize when dying.
      You may still roll your Death saving throw to try and roll a 20, but may
      only roll once on each of your turns and no more than three times.</li>

      <li>Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you regain twice as
      many as normal.</li>

      </ul>
