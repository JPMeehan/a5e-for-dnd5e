      <p>This slip of parchment contains the magically bound&nbsp;name
      &ldquo;Agnes Nittworthy&rdquo; surrounded by occult&nbsp;symbols and raven
      feathers. While you are attuned&nbsp;to it, you can use a bonus action to
      invoke the name&nbsp;on this parchment to summon a vision of a
      powerful&nbsp;and ancient hag beside you for 1 minute. Agnes
      acts&nbsp;aloof and mysterious but becomes oddly motherly&nbsp;around the
      young or incompetent. Once a vision&nbsp;is summoned in this way, it
      cannot be summoned&nbsp;again for the next 24 hours.</p><p>You can use an
      action to verbally direct the vision&nbsp;to do any of the
      following:</p><ul><li>Create ominous noises or effects (as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.eiek2vbzwijd0qac]{Thaumaturgy}).</li><li>Magically
      poison up to a pound of food within 5 feet. Any creature that consumes
      this poisoned food must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become
      poisoned for 10 minutes.</li><li>Mimic animal sounds or the voices of
      specific humanoids. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are
      imitations with a successful DC 13 Insight
      check.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is
      summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Perdita in exchange for her
      direct assistance. When you do so the parchment crumbles into dust and for
      the next minute the vision curses a creature of your choice within 30 feet
      (as @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.339zx6f5jk81fobw]{Bestow Curse},
      save DC 13) after which she disappears. Once you have revoked your claim
      in this way, you can never invoke Perdita&rsquo;s true name again.</p>
