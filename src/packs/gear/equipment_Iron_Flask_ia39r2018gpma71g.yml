    value: >-
      <p>This dark iron bottle feels heavy in your hand. Engraved with powerful
      runes of binding, it is capable of trapping otherworldly creatures. You
      can use an action to speak the command word and remove the silver stopper
      from the flask, targeting a creature within 60 feet that is not native to
      the plane of existence the flask is currently on.</p><ul><li><p>If the
      <em>iron flask</em> is empty and you can see the creature, it makes a DC
      17 Wisdom saving throw or becomes trapped in the flask. A creature that
      has previously been trapped in this flask has advantage on this save. The
      trapped creature is held in stasis—it doesn’t breathe, eat, drink, or
      age.</p></li><li><p>As an action, you can release the creature trapped
      within. A released creature remains friendly to you and your allies for 1
      hour, during which it obeys your verbal commands, and afterward it acts
      normally. Without any commands or when given a command likely to result in
      its death, the creature defends itself but otherwise takes no
      actions.</p></li><li><p>Casting <em>identify</em> on this flask also
      reveals if a creature is trapped within, but will not reveal the type. The
      only way to determine an iron flask’s contents is to open the flask and
      release its inhabitant.</p></li></ul><p>Newly acquired<em> iron
      flasks</em> may already have a trapped creature, either chosen by the
      Narrator or determined randomly.</p>
