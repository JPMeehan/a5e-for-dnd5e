      <blockquote><p>(Requires attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or
      Warlock)</p></blockquote><p>You can use an action to speak this staff’s
      command word and throw it at a point on the ground within 10 feet to
      transform it into a giant constrictor snake.</p><p>During your turn, while
      you aren’t incapacitated and remain within 60 feet of it, you can mentally
      command the snake. The snake acts immediately after you. You decide its
      moves and actions, or you can issue a general command such as to guard a
      location.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can transform the snake back into a
      staff by repeating the command word. The staff appears in the space
      formerly occupied by the snake.</p><p>If the snake has at least 1 hit
      point when it becomes a staff, it regains all its hit points. If the snake
      is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, reverting to staff form
      before shattering into pieces.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are
      wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next
      turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee
      attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this
      property while incapacitated , paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or
      stunned.</p>
