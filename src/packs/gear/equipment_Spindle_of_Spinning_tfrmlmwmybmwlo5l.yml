      <p>You can use an action to stab with this spindle, treating it as an
      improvised weapon and making a melee weapon attack roll against a creature
      within reach. On a hit, you deal 1 magical piercing damage and the
      creature makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it falls into a magical
      slumber (as the sleep spell) for 2d4 hours. A sleeping creature awakens
      when it takes damage or a loud noise occurs within 50 feet of
      it.</p><p>This enchanted slumber is infectious through touch. When a
      creature uses an action to try and shake or slap a sleeper awake, it makes
      a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it falls asleep for 1d4 hours.</p><p>The
      needle breaks when you roll a 1 on a weapon attack roll using it,
      dispersing its sleep magic in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in the area
      makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it falls asleep.</p>
