      <p>Glowing, magical symbols of spring, summer, autumn, and winter decorate
      this wooden badge. So long as at least one of the symbols remains on the
      badge, fey creatures regard you as a figure of authority. You gain an
      expertise die on Intimidation and Persuasion checks made to influence
      fey.</p><p>Whenever you create your pact weapon, you can choose to imbue
      it with the magic of one of the badge’s four symbols. For the next minute
      or until your pact weapon disappears, you gain a benefit related to the
      chosen symbol:</p><p><strong>Spring:</strong> Whenever you use your pact
      weapon to damage a creature, you regain 1d4 hit
      points.</p><p><strong>Summer: </strong>Attacks made with your pact weapon
      deal an additional 1d6 fire damage.</p><p><strong>Autumn:</strong>
      Whenever you use your pact weapon to damage a creature, the target makes a
      Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or it deals half damage
      with weapon attacks until the end of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Winter:
      </strong>You can use a bonus action to teleport up to 15 feet to an
      unoccupied space that you can see. Creatures within 5 feet of the space
      you left each take 1d4 cold damage.</p><p>The symbol disappears after its
      effect ends. Once you’ve used all four symbols, the badge becomes a
      mundane item.</p>
