      Once per week, you can use an action to speak a command word that causes
      this instrument to play its own beautiful music for 1 minute. Choose a
      creature you can see within 30 feet of the instrument that is able to hear
      the music. The creature makes a DC 13 Charisma saving throw at the start
      of each of its turns or it is forced to dance in place for as long as the
      music plays. While the creature dances, it is considered grappled.
