      <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      weapon, and it deals an extra 2d6 damage against giants (including any
      creature with the giant type, such as ettins and trolls). In addition,
      when the weapon deals damage to a giant, the giant makes a DC 15 Strength
      saving throw or falls prone. </p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b> This weapon deals
      double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this
      property only applies to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is
      stated in parenthesis after this property.</p><p><b>Defensive:</b> This
      weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or
      lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this
      weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action
      to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by
      1 until the start of your next turn.</p>
