      <p>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which
      is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of
      material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch
      can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always
      weighs 5 pounds regardless of its contents. </p><p>Placing an object in
      the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects.
      Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When
      you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always
      magically on top. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents
      spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can
      be used again. </p><p>Food or water placed in the bag immediately and
      permanently lose all nourishing qualities â€” after being in the bag, water
      no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a
      similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be
      restored to life by revivify, raise dead, or other similar magic.
      Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes
      divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time
      they begin to suffocate. </p><p>The bag cannot hold any item that would
      not fit in a normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky
      quality. If the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged,
      it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout
      the Astral Plane. </p><p>Placing a handy haversack inside another
      extradimensional storage device such as a bag of holding or portable hole
      results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything
      within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and
      disappears.</p>
