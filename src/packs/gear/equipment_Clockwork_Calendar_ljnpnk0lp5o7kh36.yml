      <p>A circular disk of dozens of interlocking gears almost a foot in
      diameter, upon first examination this device is unfathomably complex. The
      gears are covered with runes that appear to be a much older form of
      Dwarvish script. Rotating some of the raised gears causes this apparatus
      to slowly tick through a series of symbols that seem to correspond to
      astrological signs. </p><p>To understand how to operate the <em>clockwork
      calendar</em>, you must carefully study the device and turn the gears
      through their myriad configurations. After 1 hour you can make a DC 16
      Investigation or Arcana check. On a failure, you cannot reach a conclusion
      regarding how to interpret the intended function of the calendar. On a
      success, you understand how to utilize the device as indicated below.
      Casting <em>identify</em> on the calendar reveals a moderate aura of
      divination magic but provides no information on how to use this complex
      object. </p><p>Once you know how the <em>clockwork calendar</em>
      functions, you can adjust the dials to display the current day of the year
      for the geographical region of the world you are located in (this property
      does not function outside of the Material Plane). The exposed faces of the
      gears composing the calendar display the position of the stars in the sky
      and the dials can be adjusted throughout the day or night to continue to
      track their position. The calendar can also be adjusted to any past or
      future dates and times to ascertain the position of any of the celestial
      objects visible in the night sky. </p><p>Additionally, you can use a bonus
      action to smash the <em>clockwork calendar</em> and destroy it, gaining
      the benefits of the <em>haste</em> spell until the end of your next
      turn.</p>
