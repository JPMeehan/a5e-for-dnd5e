      <p>This inch-long cube has a recessed button with a distinct marking on
      each face. It starts with 36 charges and regains 1d20 of them at dawn.
      </p><p>You can use an action to press one of the buttons, expending
      charges as shown on the Cube of Force table. If the cube has insufficient
      charges, nothing happens. </p><p>Otherwise, the cube creates a 15-foot
      cube of force that is centered on you and moves with you. It lasts for 1
      minute, until you use an action to press another button, or the cube’s
      charges are depleted. </p><p>You can change the cube’s effect by pressing
      a different button. Doing so expends the requisite number of charges and
      resets the duration. </p><p>If moving causes the cube to come into contact
      with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you cannot move any
      closer to that object while the cube is active. </p><p>The cube loses
      charges when targeted by effects from the following spells or magic
      items:<em> disintegrate </em>(1d12 charges), <em>horn of blasting</em>
      (1d10 charges), <em>passwall</em> (1d6 charges), <em>prismatic spray</em>
      (1d20 charges), <em>wall of fire</em> (1d4 charges). </p>
