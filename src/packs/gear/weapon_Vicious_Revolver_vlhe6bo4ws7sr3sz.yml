      <p>When a revolver is loaded, it holds up to 6 bullets. The revolver only
      needs to be loaded after all of its ammunition has been
      fired.</p><p><em>Loading a revolver requires an action. A revolver can be
      used to make one ranged attack per bullet loaded into
      it.</em></p><p><strong>Vicious Weapon:&nbsp;</strong>When you roll a
      natural 20 on an attack roll using this weapon it deals an extra 2d6
      damage of the weapon&rsquo;s type (this extra damage does not
      double).</p><hr><p><b>Vicious:</b> A vicious weapon scores a critical hit
      on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases the
      range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1
      (maximum 17â€“20).</p>
