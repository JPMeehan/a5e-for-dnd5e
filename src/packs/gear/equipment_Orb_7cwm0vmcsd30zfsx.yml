      <p><strong><em>Arcane Focus:</em></strong> These foci are soaked in arcane
      power and often engraved or painted with eldritch symbols and cosmic
      iconography. Orbs, crystals, grimoires, staves, or wands are often used as
      spellcasting foci by sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards.</p>
