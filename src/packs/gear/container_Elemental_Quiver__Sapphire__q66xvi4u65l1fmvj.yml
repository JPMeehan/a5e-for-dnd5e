      bejeweled leather quiver, after 1 hour each is imbued with elemental power
      determined by the gem used in its construction. An elementally-imbued
      piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d4 elemental damage (see

      begins to fade after the ammunition is removed from the quiver and
      vanishes entirely after 1 minute.</p><p>Each piece of ammunition imbued
      with elemental power expends 1 charge from the quiver.</p><p>The quiver
      has 20 charges and regains 1d4+2 charges each dawn.</p><p><strong>TABLE:
