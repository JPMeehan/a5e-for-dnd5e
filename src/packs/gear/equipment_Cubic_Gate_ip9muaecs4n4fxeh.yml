      <p>This 3-inch cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. Each
      side of the cube is keyed to a different plane, one of which is the
      Material Plane. The other five sides are determined by the Narrator.
      </p><p>As an action, you may press one side of the cube and spend a charge
      to cast the gate spell, expending a charge and opening a portal to the
      associated plane. You may instead press a side twice, expending 2 charges
      and casting<em> plane shift</em> (save DC 17) which sends the targets to
      the associated plane.</p>
