      <p>Various schools of magic employ all manner of particularly
      foul-smelling and noxious substances, nauseating some would-be wizards to
      the point of illness. These enchanted amulets were created to guard
      against the various stenches found in their masters’ laboratories and
      supply closets. Enterprising apprentices quickly saw the value of peddling
      the enchanted trinkets to the affluent wishing to avoid the stench of the
      streets however, and now they are commonplace among nobility.</p><p>The
      most typical of these amulets look like pomanders though dozens of
      different styles, varieties, and scents are available for sale. While
      wearing it, you can spend an action and expend 1 charge from the amulet to
      fill your nostrils with pleasing scents for 1 hour. These scents are
      chosen by the amulet’s creator at the time of its crafting.</p><p>In more
      extreme circumstances like a stinking cloud spell or troglodyte’s stench,
      you can expend 3 charges as a reaction to have advantage on saving throws
      against the dangerous smell until the end of your next turn.</p><p>The
      amulet has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the
      last charge, roll a d20. On a or 5 or less, the amulet loses its magic and
      becomes a mundane item.</p>
