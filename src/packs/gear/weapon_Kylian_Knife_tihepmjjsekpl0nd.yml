      <p>A red ruby is set into the hilt of this silver crossdagger and it glows
      with a soft white light.</p>

      <p>You gain a +2 magical bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this
      crossdagger.</p>

      <p>You are able to attune to up to two Kylian Knives with only a single
      attunement slot. While attuned to a Kylian Knife it has the following
      properties:</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Cross Spin.</strong></em> While you are wielding this
      crossdagger, on your turn you can make a DC 5 Dexterity check to spin it
      until the start of your next turn. On a success, while the crossdagger is
      spinning your Speed increases by 10 feet, your AC increases by 2, you have
      advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you gain an additional action
      that can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash,
      Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. If you are wielding two Kylian
      Knives you may spin both with a DC 10 Dexterity check, instead increasing
      your Speed by 20 feet, your AC by 4, and granting you two additional
      weapon attacks when using your additional action to take the Attack
      action. You can spin a Kylian Knife in this way for up to 5 rounds, all at
      once or in smaller increments. The Kylian Knife regains 1 round of
      spinning capability for every hour it isn&rsquo;t in use.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Uncanny Return.</strong></em> Immediately after you throw a
      Kylian Knife and either hit or miss a target, you can choose to summon the
      crossdagger back into your hand (no action required).</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Evil and undead creatures take 2d6 radiant damage when touching this
      weapon and cannot wield it.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are
      wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next
      turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee
      attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this
      property while incapacitated , paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or
      stunned.</p>
