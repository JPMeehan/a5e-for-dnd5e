      <p>While attuned to and wearing this ornate quiver, you can draw arrows,
      bolts, or sling stones as part of taking the Attack action with a bow,
      crossbow, or sling, producing an endless supply of missiles. The
      ammunition disappears upon impact, hit or miss, and disappears if passed
      to another creature to fire.</p><p>While attuned to and wearing the rare
      version of the<em> quiver of the hunt</em>, you can also use a bonus
      action to declare a target to be your quarry. You gain advantage on
      Perception checks made to detect and Survival checks made to track the
      target, as well as Intelligence checks to determine its weaknesses. In
      addition, you deal an extra 1d6 damage on weapon attacks made against the
      target. The target remains your quarry for 8 hours, or until you cease
      concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).</p>
