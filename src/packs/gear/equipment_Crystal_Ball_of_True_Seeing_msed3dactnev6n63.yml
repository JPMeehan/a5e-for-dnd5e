      <p>A typical enchanted <em>crystal ball</em> can be used to cast the
      <em>scrying</em> spell (save DC 17) once between short rests while
      touching it.</p><p>Three legendary variations exist. In all cases, the
      legendary variants have an alignment (Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful). If
      you do not have an alignment trait that matches the crystal ball’s, after
      using it you take 6d6 psychic damage and gain a level of strife.</p><p>In
      addition to the normal benefits of scrying, you gain truesight through the
      spell’s sensor out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
