      <p>This sphere of black glass is 3/4 an inch in diameter and can be thrown
      up to 60 feet as an action. On impact it creates a 10-foot radius
      explosion. Creatures in the area make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,
      taking 5d4 force damage on a failure. A sphere of force then encloses the
      same area for 1 minute. Any creature that is completely in the area and
      fails its save is trapped within the sphere. Creatures that succeed on the
      save or that are only partially within the area are pushed away from the
      point of impact until they are outside the sphere instead.</p><p>The wall
      of the sphere only allows air to pass, stopping all other attacks and
      effects. A creature inside the sphere can use its action to push against
      the sides of the sphere, moving up to half its Speed. The sphere only
      weighs 1 pound if lifted, regardless of the weight of the creatures
      inside.</p>
