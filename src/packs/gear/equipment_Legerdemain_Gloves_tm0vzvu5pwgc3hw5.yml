      <p>Stage magic may not be as impressive as true wizardry but it can still
      delight an audience and thatâ€™s where these supple gray leather gloves got
      their start, but con artists and thieves find uses for them as well. While
      wearing both of these gloves, once per minute you can teleport an item, up
      to the size of a dagger, from one hand to the other.</p><p>The gloves can
      teleport an item a longer distance, but their magic is forever exhausted
      in the process. When you wear one glove and another creature within 120
      feet wears the other, you can teleport an item up to the size of a dagger
      into the hand of the creature wearing the other glove. If you do, the
      gloves dry and crack, losing their magic and becoming mundane items.</p>
