      <p>This simple circlet has the color of lightly-rusted iron and is
      highlighted by a large violet gem in its center, which appears to contain
      a slowly-moving metallic fluid. While attuned to this circlet, you gain a
      +1 bonus to all saving throws. Additionally, when you fail a saving throw,
      you can choose to succeed instead. You can&rsquo;t use this property again
      until the following dawn.</p><p><strong>Curse.</strong> The true name of
      the creature who crafted this circlet is forever instilled within it, and
      it becomes aware of you upon attunement. If that creature forces you to
      make a saving throw, you automatically fail, and you can&rsquo;t use this
      circlet to succeed. You can learn the name of the creature with
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.24rmiwo0w5pd746x]{Legend Lore}
      or similar magic. Short of powerful magic (such as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.pe52jryde7ljobzq]{Wish}), only the
      maker&rsquo;s willing touch or death (yours or theirs) allows you to end
      your attunement to the circlet. If you willingly end your attunement after
      the maker&rsquo;s death, the circlet loses all magical properties.</p>
