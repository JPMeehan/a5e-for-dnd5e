      <p>This fine gray dust is usually found in a vial and appears to be
      <em>dust of disappearance</em>, even when magic is used to
      <em>identify</em> it. Each vial contains enough for a single use.
      </p><p>You can use an action to throw the dust into the air. You and
      creatures within 30 feet of you that breathe make a DC 15 Constitution
      saving throw or become wracked with violent coughing and sneezing,
      becoming incapacitated and beginning to suffocate. While conscious, a
      creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      ending the effects on a success. A <em>lesser restoration</em> spell also
      ends the effects.</p>
