      <p>You can use an action to spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch
      and cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on each side. A creature
      moving across the covered area makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or
      falls prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesnâ€™t need
      to make the save.</p>
