      <p>This mixture of ambergris, saffron, and other rare ingredients can calm
      the nerves and ease mental pain. When you drink the bitter reddish-brown
      concoction in this vial you recover a level of strife. Roll 1d10. On a 1,
      you gain a short-term mental stress effect. Once a creature benefits from
      laudanum, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
