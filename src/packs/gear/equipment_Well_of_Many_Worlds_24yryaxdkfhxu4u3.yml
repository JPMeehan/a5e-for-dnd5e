      <p><strong>Crafting Components: </strong>Tuning fork that has been attuned
      to each of the planes of existence</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <p>When unfolded, this handkerchief-sized piece of lightweight, silky
      fabric expands into a 6-foot diameter circular sheet.</p>

      <p>You can use an action to unfold the cloth and spread it on a solid
      surface, creating a two-way portal to another plane of existence chosen by
      the Narrator. You can use an action to close the portal by folding the
      cloth. Once a portal has been opened in this manner, it cannot be opened
      again for [[/r 1d8 #hours]] hours.</p>
