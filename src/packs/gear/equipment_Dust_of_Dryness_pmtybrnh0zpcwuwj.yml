      <p>This small vial contains 1d6+4 pinches of dust. You can use an action
      to spread a pinch over water, transforming a 15-foot cube of water into a
      small pellet that weighs less than an ounce. </p><p>Using an action, you
      or another creature can break the pellet against any hard surface,
      releasing all of the water and destroying the pellet. </p><p>A creature
      composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC
      13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failure, or
      half damage on a success.</p>
