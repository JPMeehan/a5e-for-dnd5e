      <p>This ornate purple silk cloak is interwoven with enchanted steel
      threads.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can reshape some part of the cloak
      into any mundane steel object that can be held in one hand, such as a
      sword, a key, or a cage. This item detaches from the main cloak, but can
      be reattached on your turn (no action required). Only one item may be
      detached from the cloak at a time.</p><p>Three times between long rests,
      when you see a creature target you with an attack you can use your
      reaction to spin the cloak into its path. The cloak hardens like a shield,
      increasing your AC by +4 against that attack.</p>
