      <p>You can use an action to spread a bag of caltrops that covers a square
      area 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area makes a DC 15
      Dexterity saving throw or it stops moving this turn and takes 1d4 piercing
      damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet
      until it regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area
      at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.</p>
