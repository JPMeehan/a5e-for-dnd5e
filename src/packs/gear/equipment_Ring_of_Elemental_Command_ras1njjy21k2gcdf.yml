      by the Narrator. While wearing this ring, you have advantage on attack
      rolls against elementals from the linked plane, and they have disadvantage

      to cast dominate monster on an elemental native to the linked plane. The
      ring imparts additional benefits based on the linked plane.</p><p>The ring
      has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges at dawn. Spells cast from the ring
