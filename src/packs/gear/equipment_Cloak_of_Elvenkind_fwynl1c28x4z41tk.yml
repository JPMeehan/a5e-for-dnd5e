    value: >-
      <p>While you wear this cloak with its hood up, its color changes to
      camouflage you. While camouflaged, you gain advantage on Dexterity
      (Stealth) checks made to hide and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom
      (Perception) checks made to see you. You can use an action to put the hood
      up or down.</p>
