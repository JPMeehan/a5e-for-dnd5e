      fey</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While wearing and attuned to this
      robe of stimulating and lively colors, you can use an action to expend 1
      charge and make the garment to emit bright kaleidoscopic light for 30 feet
      and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light  lasts until the end of
      your next turn. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack
      rolls against you, and creatures within 30 feet that can see you when the
      light is emitted make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw<br>or are stunned until
      the end of your next turn. </p><p>The robe has 3 charges and regains [[/r
      1d3 #charges]] expended charges at dawn.</p>
