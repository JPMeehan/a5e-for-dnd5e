      <p>While wearing and attuned to this robe of stimulating and lively
      colors, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and make the garment to
      emit bright kaleidoscopic light for 30 feet and dim light for an
      additional 30 feet. The light  lasts until the end of your next turn.
      Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you,
      and creatures within 30 feet that can see you when the light is emitted
      make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw<br>or are stunned until the end of your
      next turn. </p><p>The robe has 3 charges and regains [[/r 1d3 #charges]]
      expended charges at dawn.</p>
