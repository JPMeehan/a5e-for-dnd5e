      <p>To use it, spend 15 gp worth of wood pulp, leather, ink, and animal
      glue. Doing so takes a week of 8-hour days. On a successful DC 15 check,
      you can sell the finished book for 25gp, on a DC 20 one, you receive 50 gp
      instead, and on a DC 25 one, you receive 250 gp. The DC 20 and 25 books
      are suitable for use as spellbooks.</p>
