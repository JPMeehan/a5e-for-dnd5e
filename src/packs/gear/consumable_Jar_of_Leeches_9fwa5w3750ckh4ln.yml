      <p>This jar contains bloodthirsty medicinal worms useful for curing many
      maladies. You can expend one use of this jar during a short rest to
      administer leeches to yourself or a willing creature. A creature who has
      leeches administered to them cannot regain hit points during this short
      rest due to blood loss, but it may repeat a saving throw to remove the
      poisoned condition or a blood-borne disease (DC equal to the original
      effect).</p><p>Alternatively, as an action you can throw this jar up to 20
      feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or
      object, treating the jar as an improvised weapon. On a hit, if the target
      is a Large or smaller creature it takes 1d4 ongoing damage. A creature can
      end this damage by using its action to remove the leeches.</p>
