      <p>This cocowood paddle has a long handle with a short but wide blade
      designed for long ocean voyages by canoe. Coats of lacquer on the paddle
      cause it to reflect light causing it to have an almost mirrored finish in
      the glare of the sun, and from a glance it’s hard to believe that it has
      ever spent a minute in the water.</p><p>This paddle has 2 charges and
      regains 1 charge each dawn. You can speak its command word as an action
      while using a water vehicle, doubling the vehicle’s speed until the start
      of your next turn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result
      of 5 or less, the paddle loses its magical properties and becomes a
      mundane item.</p>
