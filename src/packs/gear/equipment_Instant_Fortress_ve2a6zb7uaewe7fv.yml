      <p>You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and
      speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that
      remains until you use another action to speak the command word that
      dismisses it. The fortress can only be dismissed when it is empty.
      </p><p>When activated, the cube transforms into a square tower, 20 feet on
      a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement
      atop it, with a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at
      your command, which you can speak as a bonus action (it is immune to
      spells like<em> knock </em>and related magic, such as a <em>chime of
      opening</em>.) The tower’s interior has two floors, with a ladder
      connecting them and continuing on to a trapdoor to the roof. </p><p>Each
      creature in the area where the fortress appears makes a DC 15 Dexterity
      saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage
      on a success. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied
      space next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or
      carried take full damage and are pushed automatically. </p><p>The tower is
      made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The
      roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20, 100 hit points, immunity to
      damage from nonmagical weapons (excluding siege weapons), and resistance
      to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use
      of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th-level or lower). Each
      casting causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit
      points.</p>
