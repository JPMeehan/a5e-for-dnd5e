    value: >-
      <p>This ancient stone hammer is encrusted with Dwarvish runes, veined with
      glittering blue metal, and said to be capable of crippling the mind of a
      dragon. Though it was made by the dwarves of Deephall Point to slay
      Cirothe, unfortunately the mighty dragon destroyed the stout folk before
      they could wield it against her.</p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and
      damage rolls made with this warhammer. When used against a dragon, you
      instead gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and deal an extra 2d6
      thunder damage. On a critical hit against a dragon, you deal an extra 3d10
      thunder damage.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Shattersoul.</strong></em> Once per
      round when you use this warhammer to deal damage to a dragon, it makes a
      DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or suffers one level of strife. On a failure by
      5 or more, the dragon also suffers one level of
      fatigue.</p><hr><p>DESTRUCTION</p><p>The Hammer of Vengeance can be
      destroyed by a dwarf that attempts to sunder it (which is automatically
      successful).</p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b> This weapon deals double damage to
      unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies
      to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis
      after this property.</p>
