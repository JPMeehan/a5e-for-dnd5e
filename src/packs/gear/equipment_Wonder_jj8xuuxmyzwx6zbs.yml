      <p>A wonder is an unusual spellcasting focus such as a sacred flower that
      never wilts, a prismatic crystalized skull, or a polished burl that
      whispers with the language of the trees. If you lose a wonder, you can
      replace it as a ritual that takes 10 minutes and requires 5 gold worth of
      rare materials. You must be able to cast ritual spells to restore a lost
      wonder in this way. When you do so, any previous wonders created this way
      are destroyed.</p><p><strong><em>Nature Focus:</em></strong> These foci
      typically incorporate furs, feathers, living plants, sacred wood, or the
      bones or teeth of sacred animals. Staves, wands, wonders, fetishes, or
      totems are typically used as spellcasting foci by druids and rangers.</p>
