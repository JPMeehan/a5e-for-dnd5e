      u-my-md"><p>Objects hit with this sword take the maximum damage the
      weapon’s damage dice can deal.</p><p>When you use this sword to make an
      attack against a creature and roll a natural 20, the target takes an extra
      4d6 slashing damage.</p><p>Then roll an additional d20, and on a natural
      20 you chop off one of the target’s limbs (or a portion of its body if it
      has no limbs). The Narrator determines what effect (if any) the result of
      this severing off is.</p><p>You may also speak this sword’s command word
      to make the blade emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light an
      additional 10 feet. Repeating the command word or sheathing the sword
      extinguishes the blade’s light.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are
      wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next
      turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee
      attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this
      property while incapacitated , paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or
      stunned.</p>
