      <p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> A chip from a headstone or other
      grave marker at least a thousand years old that is still visited by
      mourners and well-wishers</p><p>This +1 bastard sword deals an additional
      1d4 points of necrotic damage on a hit. In addition, while wielding the
      sword, you may cast speak with dead at will without a spell slot or
      components and may target a headstone or other grave marker rather than a
      corpse. When cast on a grave marker, it brings forth a spectral image of
      the departed to speak with. The departed may decline to speak with you or
      even appear at its discretion. Finally, any creature slain by the sword is
      immediately subjected to a gentle repose
      effect.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and
      you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
