      <p>Strands of white mycelium cover the head of this gnarled wooden staff.
      When tapped on the ground, the staff sheds a thin coating of dirt. While
      attuned to the staff, you suffer no harmful effects from&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">diseases</span>&nbsp;but can still carry diseases
      and spread them to others. When you hit a creature with this staff, you
      can force the target to make a DC 12 Constitution&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">saving throw</span>. On a failure, it contracts
      one disease of your choice that you&rsquo;re currently
      carrying.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and
      you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
