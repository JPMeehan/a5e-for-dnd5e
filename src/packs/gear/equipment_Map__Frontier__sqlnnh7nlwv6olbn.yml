      <p>When using a map, you may travel at a fast pace without taking a
      penalty to your passive Perception while within the area it depicts. If
      you also use a compass in conjunction with a map, you gain an expertise
      die on checks made to avoid becoming lost.</p><p>Frontier: This map
      depicts an area only recently explored by those that made it and the
      information is often incorrect or incomplete. When consulting this map,
      the Narrator rolls a secret d20. On a result of 5 or less, the outdated or
      false information wastes travel time turning around and doubling back and
      the party only progresses half as much distance towards their
      destination.</p>
