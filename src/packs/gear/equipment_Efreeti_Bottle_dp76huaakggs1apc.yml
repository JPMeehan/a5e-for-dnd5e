      <p>You can use an action to unstopper this intricately carved brass
      bottle, causing an efreeti to appear in a cloud of acrid smoke in an
      unoccupied space within 30 feet.</p><p>When you open the bottle, roll to
      d100 to determine the effect.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><strong>EFREETI
      BOTTLE</strong></p><p><strong><em>D100
      EFFECT</em></strong></p><p><strong>01–10 </strong>The efreeti attacks you.
      The Efreeti departs after 5 rounds pass or losing half its hit points,
      whichever happens first, and the bottle becomes a mundane
      item.</p><p><strong>11–90</strong> The efreeti serves you for up to 1 hour
      before being drawn back into the bottle. The bottle cannot be opened again
      for 24 hours. This effect occurs automatically the second and third time
      the bottle is opened. The fourth time the bottle is opened, the efreeti
      vanishes and the bottle loses its
      enchantment.</p><p><strong>91–100</strong> The Efreeti grants you 3 wishes
      (as the wish spell) then vanishes after an hour or after granting the
      final wish, and the bottle becomes a mundane item.</p></blockquote>
