      <p>This ring stores spells cast into it, and holds them for later use.
      While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored within it. The
      spell has the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack modifier, and
      spellcasting ability of the original caster. Once the spell is cast, it is
      no longer stored within the ring. </p><p>When found, the ring contains
      [[/r 1d6-1 #levels]] levels of stored spells, as determined by the
      Narrator. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. To
      store a spell, a creature casts any spell of  1st- to 5th-level while
      touching the ring. The spell has no immediate effect. The level the spell
      is cast at determines how much space it uses. If the ring cannot store the
      spell, the spell fails and  the spell slot is wasted.</p>
