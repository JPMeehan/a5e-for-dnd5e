      <p>Many apprentices play pranks on one another, some of which can be quite
      painfulâ€”the box of bees is a particularly popular example and now sold by
      those with their own mischievous designs. Each of these wooden boxes is
      rectangular and approximately 2 inches long. It is usually unadorned,
      though some boxes seem to have something moving or vibrating
      inside.</p><p>When you speak the command word and use an action to expend
      1 charge, the lid slides open and a bee erupts out of the box to harass a
      creature of your choice within 20 feet. A creature harassed by the bee
      must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of
      its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature makes its next attack
      roll or ability check with disadvantage.</p><p>When you speak another
      command word and expend all 3 charges, a dozen or more bees swarm out of
      the box and attack. A creature attacked by the bees must succeed on a DC
      10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1
      minute. On a failure, the creature takes 1 point of damage and has
      disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 round.</p><p>The box
      has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last
      charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the box loses its magic and
      becomes a mundane item.</p>
