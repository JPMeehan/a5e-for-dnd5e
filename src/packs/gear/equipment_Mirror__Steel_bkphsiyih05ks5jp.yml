      <p>A steel mirror is handy when you want to look around corners, signal
      friends with reflected sunlight, keep an eye on a medusa, make sure that
      you look good enough to present yourself to the queen, or examine wounds
      that youâ€™ve received on hard-to-see parts of your body.</p>
