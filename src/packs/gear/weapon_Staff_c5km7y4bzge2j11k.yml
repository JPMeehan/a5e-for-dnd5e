      <p>In addition to its use as a spellcasting focus, a staff can also be
      used as a quarterstaff.</p><p><strong><em>Arcane Focus:</em></strong>
      These foci are soaked in arcane power and often engraved or painted with
      eldritch symbols and cosmic iconography. Orbs, crystals, grimoires,
      staves, or wands are often used as spellcasting foci by sorcerers,
      warlocks, and wizards.</p><p><strong><em>Divine Focus:</em></strong> These
      foci (often called holy symbols) are representations of a deity, pantheon,
      or ideal. They usually depict the crest or icon of a specific god or are
      of symbolic importance to a particular faith. Reliquaries, censers,
      amulets, emblems, or tattoos are often used as spellcasting foci by
      clerics and heralds.</p><p><strong><em>Nature Focus:</em></strong> These
      foci typically incorporate furs, feathers, living plants, sacred wood, or
      the bones or teeth of sacred animals. Staves, wands, wonders, fetishes, or
      totems are typically used as spellcasting foci by druids and
      rangers.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and
      you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
