      <p>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you
      can splash the oil in this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact.
      Make a ranged weapon attack against a target creature or object, treating
      the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil.
      If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute)
      it takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also
      pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square level area.
      When lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any
      creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can
      take this damage only once per turn.</p>
