      block it and sacrifice your shield, turning the critical hit into a
      regular hit. Afterwards your shield is broken, or if your shield is
      magical it instead becomes mundane for 1 hour.</p><hr class="a5e-rule

      take the Dodge action while wielding a heavy shield, you may instead take
      cover behind your shield, gaining an expertise die to your Armor Class
      until the start of your turn.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>You

      Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of
      you, you become the target instead. Removing the shield does not stop the
      curse.</p></blockquote>
