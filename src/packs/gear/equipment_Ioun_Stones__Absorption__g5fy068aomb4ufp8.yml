      <p>Some say these enchanted gems take their name from a deity of
      knowledge, others that they are named for the sound they make as they
      gently orbit their bearer’s head. Whatever the case, there are many types
      of ioun stones, each imbued with powerful beneficial magic.</p><p>The
      specifics of these stones vary but they all work in essentially the same
      way: once you have attuned to it you can use an action to set a stone in a
      gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature
      may use an action to try and take an orbiting stone, but must make a melee
      attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. An ioun
      stone’s AC is 24, it has 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage.
      While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an
      action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive
      state.</p><p>While this white marble sphere orbits your head, when a
      creature you can see casts a spell of 4th-level or lower targeting only
      you, you can use your reaction to have the stone harmlessly absorb the
      spell, suffering no damage or negative effects. The stone can absorb 20
      spell levels. If a spell is higher level than the available spell levels
      left in the stone, the spell cannot be absorbed. After absorbing 20 spell
      levels the stone loses its magic and turns a faded gray.</p>
