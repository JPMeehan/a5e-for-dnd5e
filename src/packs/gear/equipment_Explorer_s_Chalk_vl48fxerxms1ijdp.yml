      <p>This unassuming piece of white chalk appears well-used but does not
      wear down no matter how many times it marks a surface.</p><p>When you
      touch it to a surface, you can expend 1 of its charges to create a mark
      that cannot be wiped away or obscured for 24 hours.</p><p>While holding
      the chalk, you can use an action to become aware of the direction of the
      closest mark made with it as long as that mark is within 1 mile.</p><hr
      class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>The explorer’s chalk has 6 charges and regains
      1d6 expended charges each dawn. </p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>If you
      expend the explorer’s chalk’s last charge, roll a d20.</p><ul><li><p>On a
      result of 5 or less, the chalk crumbles to dust.</p><p></p></li><li><p>On
      a 20, the chalk regains its expended charges and its number of charges
      increases by 1.</p></li></ul>
