      <p>Also called a tsaine or infusion, these are specific leaves, herbs, and
      roots selected for their calming qualities. Quality of tea varies wildly
      depending on the desired ingredients. Those listed only include mundane
      ingredients with no notable medicinal qualities. Suitable, if crude,
      ingredients can be collected with the Harvest journey activity, granting 2
      portions on a success or 4 on a critical success.</p>
