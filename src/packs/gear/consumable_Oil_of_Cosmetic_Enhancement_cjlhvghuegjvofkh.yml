    value: >-
      <p>After spending 10 minutes massaging this oil into an item smaller than
      a 5-foot cube, it permanently changes the item’s cosmetic appearance. This
      might change the item’s colors, add intricate designs, or make it blend
      into its environment.</p><p>The oil causes no damage and leaves no
      residue, and it only works on nonmagical items made out of natural
      materials (such as cotton, parchment, stone, or wood).</p>
