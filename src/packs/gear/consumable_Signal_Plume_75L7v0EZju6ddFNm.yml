      <p>This small clay pot is packed with alchemical ingredients that, when
      ignited as an action, create a massive, vibrantly-colored plume of smoke
      filled with reflective particles. The plume lasts for 30 minutes and can
      be seen up to 3 miles away in the daytime. Even at night, the reflective
      particles make it possible to see one up to a mile away as long as there
      is a light source such as the moon to reflect off the plume, but this
      requires a DC 12 Perception check.</p>
