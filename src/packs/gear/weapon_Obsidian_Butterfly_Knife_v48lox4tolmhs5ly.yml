  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Made of razor-sharp obsidian, this finely-balanced blade glows faintly
      with deep purple light. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
      made with this dagger.</p><p>You can use an action to cause the dagger’s
      inner light to brighten, glowing like the corona of an eclipsed sun. This
      glow lasts for 1 minute or until you use it to deal damage to a creature.
      That creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or it takes [[/r 3d6
      #necrotic]] necrotic damage and is unable to regain hit points for 1
      minute. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target
      immediately dies and [[/r 1d4 #rounds]] rounds later its body explodes
      into a swarm of obsidian butterflies that completely eviscerate the
      corpse, leaving only the heart behind. The dagger can’t be used this way
      again until it is exposed to a new sunrise.</p>
