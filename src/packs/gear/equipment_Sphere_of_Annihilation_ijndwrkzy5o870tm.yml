      <blockquote><p>This floating sphere of darkness is a 2-foot-diameter hole
      in reality that eliminates all matter that it comes into contact
      with.</p></blockquote><p>Only artifacts can survive contact with the
      sphere, though some artifacts have a specific weakness to its
      properties.</p><p>Anything that the sphere touches or that touches it that
      is not instantly obliterated takes 4d10 force damage. The default state of
      the sphere is stationary, but should a creature be in the way of a moving
      sphere it makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or takes 4d10 force
      damage.</p><p>While within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere of
      annihilation, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana)
      check and take control of it. On a success, the sphere moves in the
      direction of your choice a number of feet equal to 5x your Intelligence
      modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward
      you instead.</p><p>If a sphere is controlled by another creature, you may
      wrest away control by using an action and making an Intelligence (Arcana)
      check opposed by the controlling creature. On a success, you take control
      of the sphere and can utilize it as normal.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p>A unique effect happens when a sphere comes into contact with
      a planar portal or extradimensional space (such as a portable
      hole).</p><p>In the case of such an event, the Narrator rolls d100 to
      determine what happens next:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1–50</strong> the
      sphere is destroyed</p></li><li><p><strong>51–85</strong> the sphere
      simply moves through the portal or into the
      space</p></li><li><p><strong>86–100</strong> a rift forms that pulls in
      all creatures and objects within 180 feet. Each object and creature,
      including the sphere, reappears in a random plane of
      existence.</p></li></ul>
