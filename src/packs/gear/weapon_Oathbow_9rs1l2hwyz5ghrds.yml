      <p>This bow whispers its urgent desire for the quick defeat of your
      enemies in Elvish when you nock an arrow. When you use this bow to make a
      ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can swear an oath against the
      target of your attack and make it your sworn enemy until its death or dawn
      seven days later. You may choose a new sworn enemy following the next dawn
      after your current sworn enemy dies.</p><p>Your ranged weapon attacks
      using this bow have advantage against your sworn enemy, and your sworn
      enemy cannot gain benefit from cover other than total cover. You do not
      have disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks with the bow that are at long
      range as long as your sworn enemy is your target, and on a hit your sworn
      enemy takes an extra [[/r 3d6 #piercing]] piercing damage.</p><p>You have
      disadvantage on attacks made with weapons other than this bow while your
      sworn enemy lives.</p>
