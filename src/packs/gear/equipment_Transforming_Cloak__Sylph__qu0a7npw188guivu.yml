      <p>While you are attuned to and wearing a transforming cloak, you gain
      resistance to a type of damage and you can use an action to activate an
      elemental form that lasts for 1 hour, until you fall unconscious, or you
      use a bonus action to end it.</p><p>Once you have used the cloak to take
      on an elemental form, you cannot use that property again until you have
      finished a long rest.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p><em>This cloak
      looks like iridescent dragonfly wings that appear to flutter when seen out
      of the corner of the eye.</em></p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While
      your air form is active you gain:</p><ul><li><p>a fly speed of 30 feet
      (hover)</p><p></p></li><li><p>you do not need to
      breathe</p><p></p></li><li><p>you do not provoke opportunity
      attacks</p><p></p></li><li><p>you can pass through spaces at least half an
      inch wide without squeezing.</p></li></ul>
