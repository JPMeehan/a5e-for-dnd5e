      u-my-md"><p>This military-styled tin contains a Tiny ethereal mottled
      green goblinoid dressed in soldierâ€™s armor and when opened it salutes with
      earnest eagerness.</p><p>You can instruct this gremlin to patrol an area,
      such as the perimeter of a room, campsite, or structure, while keeping
      watch for a creature type you instruct it to watch for.</p><p>It
      completely ignores any creatures that are not of the chosen creature type.
      If it spots a creature of the chosen type, it immediately begins shouting
      loud enough to be heard within 30 feet as it runs back into its tin to
      hide.</p>
