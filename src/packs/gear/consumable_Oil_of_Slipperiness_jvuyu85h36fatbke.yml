      <p>You can spend 10 minutes applying this thick black oil to a Medium or
      smaller creature, as well as its gear. One additional vial is required for
      each size category above Medium. A creature covered in the oil gains the
      effect of a <em>Freedom of Movement</em> spell for 2 hours. Alternatively,
      you can use an action to pour the oil on the ground next to you, making a
      10-foot square slippery, as the <em>Grease</em> spell, for 8 hours.</p>
