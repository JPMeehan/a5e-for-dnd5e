    value: >-
      <p><em>Heavy, Parrying, Two-Handed</em></p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to
      attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword, and it ignores
      resistance to slashing damage.</p><p>When you attack a creature with this
      blade and it has at least one head, rolling a natural 20 on the attack
      roll causes the sword to make a snicker-snack sound as it efficiently
      chops off one of the target's heads. If the creature can't survive without
      its head removed, it dies. This effect does not apply if the target is too
      big for its head to be removed by the sword (determined at the discretion
      of the Narrator, it doesn't need a head or have one, has immunity to
      slashing damage, or has legendary actions. In cases where a creature
      cannot lose a head, it takes an additional 6d8 slashing damage (unless it
      is immune to slashing damage; this extra damage does not
      double).</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon and
      you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
