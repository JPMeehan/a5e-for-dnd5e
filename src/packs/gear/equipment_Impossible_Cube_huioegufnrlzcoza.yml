    value: >-
      <p>At a glance this hand-sized item appears to be a metal framework in the
      simple shape of a cube, but when looked at more closely it becomes clear
      that the geometry of the framework is impossible with absurd angles,
      preposterous twists, and endpoints. Any attempt to follow the various
      lines and compositions to their conclusion is frustrating at best and
      truly maddening at worst. </p><p>When a creature with an Intelligence
      score of 6 or higher sees the cube for the first time it makes a DC 10
      Wisdom saving throw or becomes compelled to study the cube further. When a
      creature first studies the cube, it makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
      suffers from the Terrorized short-term mental stress effect (page 362) and
      a compulsion to study the cube even further. A creature that fails this
      saving throw by 5 or more instead suffers from the Distorted Perceptions
      long-term mental stress effect. Any further inspection of the cube has no
      additional effect.</p>
