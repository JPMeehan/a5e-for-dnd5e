      <p><strong>Vicious Weapon:&nbsp;</strong>When you roll a natural 20 on an
      attack roll using this weapon it deals an extra 2d6 damage of the
      weapon&rsquo;s type (this extra damage does not
      double).</p><hr><p><b>Hand-Mounted:</b> This weapon is affixed to your
      hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while
      wielding this weapon, and you have advantage on saving throws made to
      resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is wielding a
      hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket, using
      thieves’ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen
      components.</p><p><b>Vicious:</b> A vicious weapon scores a critical hit
      on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases the
      range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1
      (maximum 17–20).</p>
