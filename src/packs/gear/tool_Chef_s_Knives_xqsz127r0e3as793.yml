      dir="ltr">This set of knives is kept in a supple leather knife roll that
      is soft and well-loved. Contained within are all of the basic knives a
      chef would need to cook: a chef&rsquo;s knife, a filet knife, a paring
      knife, and a cleaver. These knives never rust or go dull, even with
      regular use.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Whenever you would make a check to complete the cooking
      journey activity and you roll a failure, treat it as a success
      instead.</p>
