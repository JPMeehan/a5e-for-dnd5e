      <p>This terra cotta pottery bowl has a glossy black band around the rim
      and is sized to be used as a nightstand washbowl. Most of it is covered in
      geometric shapes unique to each other. When you are attuned to the bowl
      and fill it with holy water, the reflection on its surface portrays your
      most recent dream, or the dream of a sleeping creature within your reach.
      If the water is disturbed the shown dream disappears and will not return.
      </p><p>Alternatively, you can shatter the bowl and choose one sleeping
      creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the sleeping creature awakens
      naturally, its dream and sleep cannot be interrupted or effected by any
      other magic.</p>
