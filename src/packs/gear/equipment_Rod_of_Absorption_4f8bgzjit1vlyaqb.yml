      archmage.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While holding this rod, when
      you are the only target of a spell you can use your reaction to absorb it
      as it is being cast. An absorbed spell has no effect and its energy is
      stored within the rod. The spell’s energy equals the spell levels used to
      cast it. The rod can store up to 50 spell levels worth of energy over the
      course of its existence. The rod cannot hold more than 50 spell levels
      worth of energy. If the rod does not have the space to store a spell and
      you try to absorb it, the rod has no effect.</p><p>After attuning to the
      rod you know how much energy it currently contains and how much it has
      held over the course of its existence. A spellcaster can expend the energy
      in the rod and convert it to spell slots —for example, you can expend 3
      spell levels of energy from the rod to cast a 3rd-level spell, even if you
      no longer have the spell slots to cast it. The spell must be a spell you
      know or have prepared, at a level you can cast it, and no higher than
      5th-level. </p><p>When found the rod contains [[/r 1d10 #spell levels]]
      spell levels. A rod that can no longer store energy and no longer has any
      energy remaining within it loses its magical properties.</p>
