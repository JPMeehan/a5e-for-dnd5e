      <p>Found in desecrated holy texts, an unliving rune is a Tiny construct of
      negative energy resembling a splotch of darkly glowing ink.</p><p>The rune
      can be applied to your skin much like a temporary tattoo, and while
      attached you can channel negative energy into an attack. On a successful
      hit with a melee weapon attack you can use your reaction to activate the
      rune, dealing an additional 1d4 necrotic damage and preventing the target
      from regaining hit points until the start of your next turn. You canâ€™t do
      so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>The rune feeds on
      your vitality while attached to your skin. You gain a slightly sickly
      appearance, and the rune consumes one use of your Hit Dice each dawn.
      During a short rest, you can peel the rune off your skin, taking 1d6
      necrotic damage. The rune can be stored in a book instead of your skin but
      offers no benefit unless attached to you. When exposed to direct sunlight
      for a minute or more, the rune is destroyed.</p><p>As an action you can
      place the rune on a humanoid corpse that has died within the last 8 hours.
      The rune is destroyed as its magic is absorbed by the corpse, animating it
      as a zombie. When placing the rune, you can feed it a portion of your life
      force by spending hit points. The zombie obeys your spoken commands and is
      friendly to you and your companions for 1 round per hit point you spent
      when placing the rune. At the end of this duration it becomes hostile to
      all living creatures.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><blockquote><p><strong>Curse</strong>. The unliving rune is
      cursed and while it is attached to you any senses or divinations that can
      detect undead incorrectly detect you as undead. If you die while the rune
      is attached to you, you are reanimated as a zombie after 1d4
      rounds.</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">
