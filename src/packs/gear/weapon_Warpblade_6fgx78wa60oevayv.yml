      <p>This dagger cuts through space as easily as flesh. You gain a +3 bonus
      to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>

      <p>Weapon attacks using warpblade deal an extra [[/r 2d6 #force damage]]
      force damage. While you are attuned to the dagger and take the Attack
      action, you can choose an object or surface within 60 feet, making one of
      your attacks against it (AC 10). On a successful hit, warpblade is
      embedded into the target. While <em>warpblade</em> is embedded, you can
      use a reaction to instantly teleport yourself to an unoccupied space
      adjacent to it and remove it from the target. In addition, on your turn
      you can instantly return warpblade to your hand (no action required).</p>

      <p>Warpblade has 5 charges and regains [[/r 1d4+1 #charges]] charges each
      dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast the
      following
      spells:<br>@UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.ijh0tu0wgpsp7v6n]{Misty
      Step} (1 charge),
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.c9j5g49kht85ek3u]{Dimension Door} (2
      charges), @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.5ijl5b1goq9774l3]{Teleport} (3
      charges).</p>
