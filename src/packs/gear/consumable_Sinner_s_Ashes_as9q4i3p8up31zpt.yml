      <p>This small stark urn contains the ashen remains of an unholy
      humanoid.</p><p>As an action, you can throw the urn up to 30 feet away
      where it shatters and produces a 20-foot radius black cloud of ash. This
      area is heavily obscured and any creature that ends its turn within the
      area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 necrotic
      damage. This ash cloud remains for 1 minute, until a moderate wind (at
      least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, or until a
      strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1
      round.</p><p>Alternatively, the ashes can be used as an ingestible poison.
      The urn contains enough ashes for a single dose, and any celestial that
      consumes them must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8
      necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</p>
