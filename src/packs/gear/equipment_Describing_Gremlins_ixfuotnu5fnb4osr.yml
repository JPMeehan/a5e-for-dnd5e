      <p>This little porcelain chair has a Tiny ethereal purple goblinoid
      sitting on it, and in the creature’s hands sits another even smaller
      purple goblinoid, and in their hands sits an even smaller goblinoid, and
      the motif seems to go on forever smaller. </p><p>This item includes 10
      gremlins of decreasing scale from the largest at 4 inches tall, to the
      smallest that’s roughly the size of an amoeba. </p><p>If you place a
      single drop of a substance in front of the series of gremlins, the largest
      of them leans towards it and allows the smaller gremlins a minute to
      observe the drop’s contents at a cellular level. The smallest gremlin
      explains to the next size up, and so on, with the largest gremlin
      communicating back to you the description of the contents at a cellular
      level. </p><p>The gremlins are not particularly intelligent so most of
      their descriptions are similar to “<em>some sorta green globs</em>”  or
      “<em>a buncha squidgy spiny things what tried to eat
      me</em>”.</p><p>Although this information is not scientifically or
      medically helpful, it can easily be used to identify if a substance is the
      same as another previously observed substance as the gremlins are
      consistent in their descriptions.</p>
