      <p><em>Breaker (Wood), Defensive (Light), Dual-Wielding, Simple, Thrown
      (20/60)</em></p>

      <p><strong>Vicious Weapon:&nbsp;</strong>When you roll a natural 20 on an
      attack roll using this weapon it deals an extra 2d6 damage of the
      weapon&rsquo;s type (this extra damage does not
      double).</p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b> This weapon deals double damage to
      unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies
      to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis
      after this property.</p><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be
      used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or
      heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield
      designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with
      your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p><p><b>Vicious:</b> A vicious weapon scores a critical hit on a
      roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases the range
      of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum
      17â€“20).</p>
