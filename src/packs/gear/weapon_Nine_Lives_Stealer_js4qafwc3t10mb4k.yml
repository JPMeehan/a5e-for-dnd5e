      <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      sword.</p><p>The sword has [[/r 1d8+1 #charges]] charges. When you use the
      sword to score a critical hit against a creature that is not a construct
      or undead, if it has less than 100 hit points it makes a DC 15
      Constitution saving throw or it instantly dies as the sword rips the life
      force out of it. Each time a creature is killed in this manner the sword
      expends a charge. When all its charges are gone, the sword loses this
      property. </p><p>This item variant can be created as:</p><p>Nine Lives
