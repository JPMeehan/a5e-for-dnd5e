    value: >-
      <p>Made from the rare blueheart flower found only on the coastal cliffs
      near the Festung, this cyan potion uses the rare plant to counteract the
      fiendish influences of hellspore blight. When properly prepared the plant
      (said to have been wrought by unusual magic exposed to the sea) rapidly
      consumes hellspores in a creature&rsquo;s body and grants a refreshing
      boost of energy.</p><p>When you drink this potion, you are automatically
      cured of hellspore blight and recover from one level of fatigue.</p>
