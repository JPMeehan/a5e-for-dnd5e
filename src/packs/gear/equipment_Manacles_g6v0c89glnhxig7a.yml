      <p>These metal restraints (AC 16, 20 hit points) can restrain a Small or
      Medium creature. You can restrain an unwilling creature which requires an
      action, and for the creature to be either restrained, or both grappled and
      prone. Escaping the manacles requires a DC 20 Dexterity check, and
      breaking them requires a DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes
      with one key. Without the key, a DC 15 thievesâ€™ tools check can pick this
      lock.</p>
