      <p>This pewter talisman hangs from a simple silk cord. While you are
      attuned to and wearing this amulet, you gain the following immunities.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Divination spells cast by creatures other than the amulet&rsquo;s
      creator.</li>

      <li>The charmed, frightened, and rattled conditions.</li>

      <li>Any effect that would read your emotions or thoughts (as the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.wad0cgw4tcdbuvbr]{Mind Blank}
      spell).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In addition, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 100 feet to
      an unoccupied space you can see (minimum 10 feet). Once you have used this
      property to teleport a total of 400 feet, you cannot use it again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>When the amulet&rsquo;s creator dies it becomes an amulet of
      protection.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Cursed.</strong></em> You cannot remove this amulet until
      you are targeted by
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.l16wg9h1z9s16exb]{Remove Curse} or
      similar magic. When you do so, the amulet teleports back to its creator
      and you make a DC 20 Constitutionsaving throw or suffer 1d4+1 levels of
      strife.</p>

      <p>In addition, when you attune to this amulet the creator may command
      that you keep their secrets. While you are on the same plane of existence
      as the amulet&rsquo;s creator, they can telepathically communicate with
      you, give you commands (as the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.a64cea2ij2t33xva]{Geas} spell), and
      you are unable to share information about them through pantomime, speech,
      writing, or any other means unless they allow you to do so. When you are
      reduced to 0 hit points while wearing the amulet, you and all of your
      belongings are teleported back to the amulet&rsquo;s creator.</p>
