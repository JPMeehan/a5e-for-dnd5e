    value: >-
      <p>This dessicated head of a fiend mumbles occasionally&nbsp;as if trying
      to speak but cannot, its eyes and&nbsp;mouth sewn shut with a rough black
      cord. The&nbsp;head longs to escape this prison and return to
      Hell,&nbsp;shaking violently and cursing whenever it is within&nbsp;60
      feet of an active portal.</p><p>Alternatively, as an action you can direct
      the head at a visible creature within 60 feet and cut the cord tying the
      imp&rsquo;s lips, causing it to burst into flames and making the spirit
      inside lash out. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,
      taking 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.</p>
