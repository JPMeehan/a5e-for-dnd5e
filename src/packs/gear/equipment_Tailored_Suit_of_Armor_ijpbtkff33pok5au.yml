      <p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">For the debonair gentleman or
      sophisticated lady who wishes to attend the ball in something respectable
      but still retain the safety of mind that armor provides, this set of
      padded leather armor is glamoured with an illusion that makes it look like
      a finely-tailored suit or dress.</span></p>

      <p>This illusion does not hold up to physical scrutiny and any creature
      who physically interacts with the armor sees through the figment with a
      successful DC 10 Investigation check.</p>
