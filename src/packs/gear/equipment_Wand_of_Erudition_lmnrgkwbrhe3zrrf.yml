      head of a scholar at least a century old</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and
      target one willing humanoid you can see within 30 feet. For the next hour,
      the<br>target gains one of the following benefits:</p>

      <p>&bull; The ability to read, speak, and understand one language you are
      proficient with.</p>

      <p>&bull; Proficiency with one skill or tool with which you are
      proficient.</p>

      <p>&bull; Knowledge of some piece of information you know that you could
      communicate in less than 1 minute, such as the contents of a book you have
      read or directions to a location familiar to you. The target gains this
      knowledge even if you do not share a language. When the effect ends, the
      target forgets the information you imparted.</p>

      <p>This wand has 5 charges and regains [[/r 1d4+1 #charges]] expended
      charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]].
      On a 1, the wand fades from existence and you forget you ever owned it.
