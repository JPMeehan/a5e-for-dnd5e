      <p>This paper packet bearing a winking wizardâ€™s face contains a dozen
      brightly colored sugary pebbles that fizz when eaten.</p><p>When you
      consume a piece of this candy, you can use a bonus action to throw your
      voice to any point you can see within 60 feet, and your voice emanates
      directly from that point until the start of your next turn. This effect
      lasts for 1 hour.</p><p>Alternatively, you can consume all 12 fizzy rocks
      to cast <em>thunderwave </em>as a 2nd-level spell (dealing 2d8 thunder
      damage; save DC 14). <em>You are made an additional target of the spell
      when casting it in this way.</em></p>
