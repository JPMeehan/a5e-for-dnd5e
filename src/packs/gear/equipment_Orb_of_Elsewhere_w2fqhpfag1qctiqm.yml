      <p>This crystalline orb is filled with dense smoke that constantly changes
      color. While holding the orb, you can use an action and speak its command
      word to open a portal to a random location on a plane from the Orb of
      Elsewhere table. The portal remains open either until the next dawn on
      your original Material Plane, or until you use an action to speak the
      command word to close it. </p><p>Once the portal is closed, the orb
      remains at the entry point to that plane. If at the end of the duration
      the orb has not been used to create a portal of return, it teleports to a
      random point on its plane of origin (leaving any creatures that traveled
      through the portal stranded).</p><p>The orbâ€™s destination changes at dawn
      on your Material Plane each day, and its portal never goes to the same
      location twice in a row.</p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>TABLE:
