      <p>This crumpled vellum scroll is scrawled with an Infernal statement
      outlining the beliefs of a specific yet unnamed fiend. Whether or not you
      can read the language, while studying the statement you gain an expertise
      die on a Religion check made to recall or learn information about fiends.
      You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>By repeatedly
      reciting the creed aloud as an action each round for 1 minute, you can
      cast find familiar, except your familiar takes the form of either an imp
      or a quasit. The creed is irrevocably absorbed into the familiar’s body
      and is completely destroyed when the familiar drops to 0 hit
      points.</p><p><strong>Curse.</strong> The familiar summoned by the creed
      is cursed. The fiend who wrote the creed can observe you through the
      summoned familiar, and can command the familiar to take actions while you
      are asleep or unconscious.</p>
