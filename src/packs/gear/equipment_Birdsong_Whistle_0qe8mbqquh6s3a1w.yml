      <p>This carving of reddish soapstone resembles a miniature cardinal. When
      air is blown through the lower back high-pitched sounds are emitted
      through the birdâ€™s open beak. When the whistle is blown the sounds of
      songbirds are heard by all creatures in a 100-foot radius. These calls are
      indistinguishable from actual birds singing.</p><p>Alternatively, you can
      use an action to break the whistle to summon a large flock of birds that
      appear at the start of your next turn and surround you in a 10-foot
      radius. The flock moves with you and makes you heavily obscured from
      creatures more than 10 feet away for 1 minute, or until the flock takes 10
      or more damage from area effects.</p>
