      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Once per turn, when you use this sword to
      hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, in addition to dealing the
      attack damage you may inflict it with a wound.</p><p>A wounded creature
      takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for each wound
      you have inflicted this way. Whenever the creature is damaged by its
      wound, it can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending all wound
      effects it is suffering from on a success.</p><p>Alternatively, the wounds
      can be healed if the wounded creature (or a creature within 5 feet of it)
      uses an action to make a DC 15 Medicine check, ending all wound effects it
      is suffering from on a success.</p><p>Damage dealt by this sword can only
      be regained by taking a short or long restâ€” no other method, magical or
      otherwise, will restore the hit points.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This
      weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or
      lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this
      weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action
      to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by
      1 until the start of your next turn.</p>
