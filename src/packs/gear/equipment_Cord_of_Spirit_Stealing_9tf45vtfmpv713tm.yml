    value: >-
      <p>This leather cord is the color of stained blood and feels slightly
      moist. When wrapped around the handle of a melee weapon, the cord captures
      some of the energy of any sapient creature the weapon is used to kill.
      When you reduce a hostile sapient creature to 0 hit points, the cord gains
      1 charge (to a maximum of 5). You can use a bonus action to spend 1 charge
      from the cord to cast false life, or expend more additional charges to
      increase the spellâ€™s level to the number of charges expended.</p>
