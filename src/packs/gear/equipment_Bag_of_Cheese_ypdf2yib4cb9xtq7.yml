      <p>This item is often bought from apprentice wizards with an adventurer’s
      first reward from questing. It is a yellow bag with the word “cheese”
      embroidered on it (in Common). Any food you put in this bag becomes
      cheese, but retains its original taste and condition—a moldy and dirty
      loaf of bread becomes a moldy and dirty piece of cheese. Any non-food
      items develop a distinctly cheesy aroma.</p><p>Alternatively, you can turn
      the bag inside out, transforming it into 1 Supply worth of any type of
      mundane cheese.</p>
