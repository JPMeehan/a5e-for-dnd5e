      <p>This bag’s interior space is significantly larger than its apparent
      size of roughly 2 feet at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up
      to 500 pounds and has an internal volume of 64 cubic feet. Regardless of
      its contents, it weighs 15 pounds. Retrieving an item from the bag
      requires an action. If you have never interacted with a specific bag of
      holding before, the first time you use it, it requires 1d4 rounds to take
      stock of its contents before anything can be retrieved from the
      bag.</p><p>Food or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently
      lose all nourishing qualities — after being in the bag, water no longer
      slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar
      fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored
      to life by revivify, raise dead, or other similar magic. Breathing
      creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the
      number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to
      suffocate.</p><p>The bag cannot hold any item that would not fit in a
      normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky
      quality.</p><p>If the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally
      damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered
      throughout the Astral Plane. Placing a bag of holding inside another
      extradimensional storage device such as a portable hole or handy haversack
      results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything
      within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and
      disappears.</p>
