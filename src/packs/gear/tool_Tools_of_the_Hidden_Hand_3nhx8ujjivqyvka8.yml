      <p>Carrying thieves’ tools is frequently illegal without a license or
      certification for locksmithing and even then can be an unfortunate piece
      of circumstantial evidence in the courts.</p><p>As an action, you can
      alter the shape of these thieves’ tools to resemble any one set of
      artisan’s tools.</p><p>If used for any task related to their new
      appearance, the illusion fades. The illusion can also be detected by a
      creature that spends an action inspecting them and succeeds on a DC 13
      Investigation check.</p><p>Alternatively, while you are touching these
      thieves’ tools you can command them to truly become whatever type of
      artisan’s tools they are disguised as. You add your proficiency bonus to
      the first ability check you make with that set of artisan’s
      tools.</p><p>Afterward the artisan’s tools remain in their new form as all
      magic fades from them and they become a mundane item.</p>
