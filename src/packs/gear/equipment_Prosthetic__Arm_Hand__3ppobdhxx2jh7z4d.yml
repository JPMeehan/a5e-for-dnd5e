      <p>Prosthetics are usually metal and custom made to replace whatever
      portion of a limb has been lost.</p><p>Arm or Hand: You cannot gain
      advantage or expertise dice on Sleight of Hand checks made with this
      prosthetic. However, prosthetics can provide an unexpected block, and when
      you use it defensively you gain a +1 bonus to your AC as if you were
      wielding a hands-free light shield with the prosthetic. Prosthetics used
      defensively in this way cannot wield weapons.</p>
