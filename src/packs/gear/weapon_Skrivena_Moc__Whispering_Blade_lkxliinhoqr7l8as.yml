      <p>A huge red ruby is set into the pommel of this&nbsp;intricately
      filigreed golden longsword. The jewel&nbsp;shimmers and shines as the
      blade speaks in a voice&nbsp;that resonates with a deep and distant
      baritone.&nbsp;Without this illusion, a twisted demonic form
      is&nbsp;revealed: the blade is composed of a single sharpened&nbsp;tooth,
      what appears to be the hilt is instead a&nbsp;grotesque sucker-like mouth,
      and the ruby pommel&nbsp;is a figment covering a single great crimson
      eye&nbsp;that stares with fiendish intelligence.</p>

      <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      longsword. An intense burning heat radiates from the blade and it deals an
      extra 3d6 fire damage on a successful hit.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Attached Properties.</strong></em> While attached
      to&nbsp;Skrivena Moc, you gain resistance to fire, proficiency&nbsp;with
      longswords, and after taking the&nbsp;Attack action on your turn you can
      use your&nbsp;reaction to make a melee weapon attack using&nbsp;it.
      However, the weapon forms a permanent&nbsp;bond with its wielder and
      cannot be put down&nbsp;or removed once wielded.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Corruption.</strong></em> At the end of each week
      that&nbsp;Skrivena Moc is attached to you, your Charisma&nbsp;score is
      decreased by 1d4. When you have lost 6&nbsp;or more Charisma in this way,
      raised black veins&nbsp;radiate out from the point of Skrivena
      Moc&rsquo;s&nbsp;attachment. This Charisma loss cannot be
      healed&nbsp;until Skrivena Moc is no longer attached to you,&nbsp;at which
      point you recover 1 Charisma at the&nbsp;end of each long rest.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Fiend Transformed.</strong></em> This elegantly crafted
      longsword of filigreed gold whispers promises of greater treasures to
      come&mdash;yet those who wield it are doomed. In truth it is an imprisoned
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-monsters.Actor.f153j1z5tupupxpg]{Balor} reduced
      in power by potent enchantments, the elegant blade only an illusion. Any
      that dare grasp the infernal hilt know not their peril, unaware they are
      actually plunging their hand into a fiendish maw.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> Skrivena Moc is a sentient
      construct&nbsp;with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 16, and Charisma&nbsp;22. It
      has hearing and truesight to a range of 120&nbsp;feet. The longsword
      communicates with you telepathically&nbsp;and can speak and understand
      Abyssal,&nbsp;Common, and up to 3 other languages of
      the&nbsp;Narrator&rsquo;s choice.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> Skrivena Moc needs a wielder
      to&nbsp;accomplish much of anything and it is a peerless&nbsp;manipulator.
      Wrathful and vindictive, the fiend&nbsp;blade sees those who carry it as
      insignificant and&nbsp;a means to an end. However it has been stuck
      in&nbsp;this form for centuries and has learned to maintain&nbsp;a helpful
      and subservient fa&ccedil;ade to better&nbsp;facilitate the careful
      orchestration of events whenever&nbsp;possible, only revealing its true
      intentions as&nbsp;a last resort. Once wielded, the fiend blade
      grabs&nbsp;hold and cannot be dropped. The demon makes&nbsp;hasty
      apologies for its &ldquo;curse&rdquo;, manipulating its&nbsp;wielder into
      serving its will&mdash;it acts as a powerful&nbsp;weapon but slowly drains
      away their vital essences&nbsp;until they die, all the while using them to
      track&nbsp;down potential cures for its
      transformation.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed to be
      used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or
      heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield
      designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with
      your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
