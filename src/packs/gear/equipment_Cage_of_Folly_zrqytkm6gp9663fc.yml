      <p>This small silver or gold birdcage traps your bad ideas and puts them
      on display. When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, a
      little piece of a mechanical bird materializes inside the cage: first the
      feet, then legs, body, wings, and head. You can immediately reconsider and
      reroll the ability check. The <em>cage of folly</em> can be used once
      every 24 hours, and recharges at the end of each week.</p><p>Once you have
      used the birdcage 5 times, the bird sings a mocking song for 1 hour when
      you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check. If you open the
      birdcage and let the bird go free, it gives you one piece of good advice
      about a current problem or question that you face. At the Narratorâ€™s
      discretion, the advice may give you advantage on one ability check made in
      the next week. Afterward it flies away as the birdcage loses its magic and
      becomes a mundane item (though some who have released their birds claim to
      have encountered them again in the wilds later.)</p>
