      <p>This waxed leather mask covers an entire humanoid&nbsp;face and
      resembles the beak of a bird. A pair of&nbsp;glass lenses allow you to see
      through it and the bill&nbsp;provides a constant smell of lavender. While
      attuned&nbsp;to the plague doctor&rsquo;s mask, you gain an
      expertise&nbsp;die on Constitution saving throws against diseases.</p>

      <p>When you spend your action to concentrate and inhale the fragrance
      inside the mask, you recall memories from the brilliant surgeon who
      created the item. This strips the mask of its magic but allows you to
      recall the details of a particularly dangerous case. You have advantage on
      Medicine checks made to treat any single nonmagical disease of your choice
      until the end of your next long rest, at which point the memories
      vanish.</p>
