      <p>At every level of society—but especially when you’re on the bottom —
      going unnoticed can be a great benefit. Invisibility is one thing but
      effectively hiding your home and your possessions can be harder. As an
      action, you can expend 1 charge to draw a large X on one object up to the
      size of a normal door. This has no effect on creatures, or objects worn by
      creatures. Creatures other than you that see the marked object roll a DC
      10 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, they do not notice the
      marked object as anything out of the ordinary from its surroundings (such
      as a blasphemous icon in a church, a barrel of gunpowder in a kitchen, or
      an unsheathed weapon resting against the wall of a bedroom going
      unnoticed). On a success, they can interact with the object normally. A
      creature that remains in the area and is consciously searching for the
      kind of object that you have marked receives a new saving throw at the end
      of each minute. A creature interacting with a marked object automatically
      reveals it to all creatures who observe the interaction. A charcoal mark
      lasts for 24 hours or until it is wiped away as an
      action.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 2 charges to increase the DC
      to notice the object to 15. The charcoal has 2 charges and regains 1
      charge each dusk.</p><p>If you expend the last charge, the charcoal is
      consumed.</p>
