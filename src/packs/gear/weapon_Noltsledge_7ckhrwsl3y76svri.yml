      <p><em>Breaker, Heavy, Two-Handed</em></p>

      <p>Large by even a giant&rsquo;s standards, this enormous hammer&rsquo;s
      handle is as long as a quarterstaff and its head is a simple log sharpened
      to a sturdy point. You gain a +2 magical bonus to attack and damage rolls
      made with this maul.</p>

      <p>In addition, while attuned this weapon has the following
      properties.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Perceive Undead.</strong></em> You gain advantage on
      Perception checks made against undead and you are able to see undead that
      are invisible.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Powerful Attacks.</strong></em> You gain the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-feats.Item.e6506kodovstp5yw]{Powerful Attacker}
      feat, and while using the feat you gain advantage on attack rolls made
      against undead. If you already have the Powerful Attacker feat, instead
      your Strength score increases by 2.</p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b> This weapon
      deals double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If
      this property only applies to a specific type of material, such as wood,
