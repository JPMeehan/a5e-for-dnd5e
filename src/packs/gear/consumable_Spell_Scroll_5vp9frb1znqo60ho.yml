      <p>A spell scroll bears a sealed spell within.</p><p>If the spell is on
      your class’ spell list, you can use the scroll to cast the spell (taking
      the spell’s normal casting time) without the need for material components.
      Otherwise the spell scroll is unreadable to you.</p><p>If you are
      interrupted while using the scroll, you may attempt to use it
      again.</p><p>Once the spell within a scroll has been cast, the scroll
      crumbles away.</p><p>To use a spell scroll of a higher spell level than
      you are able to cast, you must succeed on spellcasting ability check (DC
      10 + the spell’s level). On a failure, the magical energy within is
      expended with no effect, leaving behind a blank piece of
      parchment.</p><p>A wizard may use a spell scroll to copy the spell stored
      within to their spellbook by making an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10
      + the spell’s level). Whether the check succeeds or not, the attempt
      destroys the spell scroll.</p>
