      <p>This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and
      4d10 opals. Gems removed from the helm crumble to dust. The helm loses its
      magic when all the gems are removed. </p><p>While wearing this helm, you
      gain the following benefits: </p><p>• You can use an action to cast one of
      the following spells (save DC 18) with the listed gem as its component:
      daylight (opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray (diamond), or wall
      of fire (ruby). The gem is then destroyed. </p><p>• If at least one
      diamond remains, the helm casts dim light in a 30-foot radius if at least
      one undead is within 30 feet. Any undead that starts its turn in the light
      takes 1d6 radiant damage. </p><p>• If at least one ruby remains, you have
      resistance to fire damage. </p><p>• If at least one fire opal remains, you
      can use an action to speak a command word and cause a weapon you are
      holding to erupt in flames, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on
      a hit. The flames cast bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for
      an additional 10 feet. The flames last until you use a bonus action to
      speak the command word or you release the weapon. </p><p>• Whenever you
      fail a saving throw against a spell and take fire damage as a result, roll
      a d20. On a 1, light blazes from the remaining gems. Each creature within
      60 feet other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or
      take radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and
      the remaining gems are then destroyed.</p>
