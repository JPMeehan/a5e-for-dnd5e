      After you attune to this 1-foot square 6-inch thick book it hides its true
      nature to anybody else, appearing to be a mundane diary. When you open it
      however, the book reveals a Tiny storage compartment. The storage space is
      the same size as the book, and because this item doesnâ€™t function as a
      pocket dimension it can be safely used to store such items (such as a
      portable hole).
