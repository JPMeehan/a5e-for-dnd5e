      <p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> A stack of at least 10 used magic
      scrolls</p>

      <p>This unassuming book is often mistaken for a wizard&rsquo;s spellbook,
      but it has a different, if similar, purpose. Each of these books has a
      command word. When a magic scroll that has not been used is placed inside
      the pages and the command word is spoken, the scroll is resized and bound
      into the book as a page, protecting it (the book is waterproof and
      fireproof) and making it easy to access. The scroll may otherwise be used
      as normal, and crumbles away as normal. The book can hold up to 50 scrolls
      in this manner and can flip to any individual scroll as a bonus action
      when its spell name is spoken aloud. An individual scroll can be removed
      from the book by touching the page and speaking the book&rsquo;s command
      word again, which returns the scroll to its original form.</p>
