      <p>Has 10 charges (weighs 3 lbs. and costs 25 gp to fully restock, which
      can be done wherever you can purchase a component pouch or otherwise
      gather spell components), which you can use to fake the casting of up to
      5th-level evocation spells with instantaneous effects and conjuration
      spells where you can provide what is being summoned (e.g. faking
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find
      Familiar} to pull a rabbit out of a hat). To fake the casting of a spell
      you can use an action to make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC equal to
      20 + twice the spell level and expend a number of charges from your
      magician&rsquo;s kit equal to the spell level (cantrips use no charges).
      People who disbelieve you can make an Arcana or Religion check opposed by
      your original roll. The faked spell has no effect beyond looking and
      sounding like the real spell. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you can
      attempt higher level spells or spells from other schools of magic, but
      they require additional preparation and cost to pull off.</p>
