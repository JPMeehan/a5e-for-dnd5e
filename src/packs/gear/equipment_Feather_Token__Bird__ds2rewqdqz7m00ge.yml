      <p>This small silver charm resembles a feather. Many types of feather
      tokens exist with different effects.</p><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p>You can use an action to toss the token nearby where it
      transforms into a roc.</p><p>The bird obeys simple commands, though it
      will not attack, and can fly 16 miles an hour for up to 6 hours while
      carrying up to 500 pounds, or at half that speed while carrying up to
      1,000 pounds.</p><p>The roc disappears after flying its maximum distance
      or when reduced to 0 hit points. You may spend an action to dismiss the
      roc.</p>
