      <p>People seeking a permanent change to their body tend to avoid
      shapechanging magic — it’s costly and scarce, and the thought of a wayward
      dispel reverting you to your old form and triggering a wave of dysphoria
      is horrifying. Instead most seek out magics that gradually encourage the
      systems of their body to adopt a new form. These magics take many shapes:
      potions from an alchemist, a blessed amulet, a pouch of ritual ingredients
      from a wizard. </p><p>Using the magic requires a 5 minute ritual at the
      end of each long rest. At the end of the first month, your outward
      appearance begins to take on the shape and characteristics of a form more
      comfortable to you. By the end of six months of use, your body fully
      shifts to your desired comfortable form. To maintain the new form you must
      continue to perform the ritual—ceasing it reverts these changes at the
      same pace. Any new form must be of the same heritage as your previous
      form. </p><p>Most practitioners provide 3 months’ supply at a time to
      encourage you to regularly seek assessment from a transmutation expert and
      catch dangerous changes before they cause you trouble. Unsurprisingly,
      many transmutation wizards, alchemists, and priests of elven deities
      across the land chose their career so they could pursue this path without
      any gatekeepers.</p>
