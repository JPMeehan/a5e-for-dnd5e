      <p>Attacks made using this grim-looking weapon do both physical and
      supernatural harm. You can use a bonus action to let the weapon feed off
      your life force. While activated, whenever you successfully hit with the
      warhammer you deal an  additional [[/r 1d6 #necrotic]] necrotic damage,
      but also take [[/r 1d4 #cold]] cold damage. This effect lasts until
      deactivated by using another bonus action or letting go of the
      weapon.</p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b> This weapon deals double damage to
      unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies
      to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis
      after this property.</p>
