      <p>This magical book outlines a vigorous exercise regimen. Spending 48
      hours over 6 days (or fewer) reading and following the bookâ€™s regimen
      increases your Strength score and your maximum Strength score by 2. The
      manual then becomes a mundane item for a century before it regains its
      magic.</p>
