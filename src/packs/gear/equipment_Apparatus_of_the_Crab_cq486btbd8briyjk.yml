      <p>This ingeniously crafted item (known by some as the crabaratus) is a
      tightly shut 500 pound iron barrel. Making a DC 20 Investigation check
      reveals a hidden catch which unlocks one end of the barrelâ€”a hatch. Two
      Medium or smaller creatures can crawl inside where there are 10 levers in
      a row at the far end. Each lever is in a neutral position but can move up
      or down. Use of these levers makes the barrel reconfigure to resemble a
      giant metal crab.</p><p>This item is a Large object with the following
      statistics:</p><p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 20</p><p><strong>Hit
      Points:</strong> 200</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft.
      (both are 0 ft. without legs and tail extended)</p><p><strong>Damage
      Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p><p>The item requires a pilot to be
      used as a vehicle. The hatch must be closed for it to be airtight and
      watertight. The apparatus holds 10 hours worth of air for breathing,
      dividing by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p><p>The apparatus
      floats on water and may dive underwater down to 900 feet, taking 2d6
      bludgeoning damage at the end of each minute spent at a lower
      depth.</p><p>Any creature inside the apparatus can use an action to
      position up to two of the levers either up or down, with the lever
      returning to its neutral position upon use. From left to right, the
      Apparatus of the Crab table shows how each lever
      functions.</p><p><br><strong>Table: Apparatus of the
