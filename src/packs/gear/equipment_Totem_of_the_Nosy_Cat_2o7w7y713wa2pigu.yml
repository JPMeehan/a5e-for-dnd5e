      dir="ltr">This small, wooden totem is carved in the shape of a house cat.
      When you speak the command word, the totem turns into a Tiny calico cat
      who looks up at you expectantly. The cat is friendly to you and your
      allies and will purr loudly if acknowledged. If you ask the cat its name,
      it simply replies, &ldquo;Mew?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">As a bonus action,
      you may command the cat to investigate the area ahead. So long as the cat
      remains within 100 feet of you, you may use an action to see through the
      cat&rsquo;s eyes and listen through its ears. The nosy cat has all of the
      statistics of the cat stat block, though any Perception checks made
      through its eyes use your modifier (if it is higher). After 10 minutes, or
      if the cat is reduced to 0 hit points, it reverts back to its totem form
      and immediately teleports back into your hand. The cat cannot be summoned
      again in this way until the next day.</p>
