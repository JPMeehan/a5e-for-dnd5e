      <p>This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name
      “<em>Holtrathamogg</em>” surrounded by eldritch symbols that defy all
      translation.</p><p>While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action
      to invoke the name on this parchment to summon a vision of a dark and
      tentacled elder evil beside you for 1 minute. <em>Holtrathamogg </em>is
      utterly alien and is disquietingly silent unless spoken to.</p><p>Once a
      vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next
      24 hours.</p><p>You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do
      any of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Instantly snuff out a bonfire, candle,
      or similar light source within 15 feet.</p></li><li><p>Translate up to 25
      words of spoken or written Deep Speech into Common.</p></li><li><p>Whisper
      madness into the ears of a target creature within 5 feet. A creature
      whispered to in this way makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or becomes
      frightened until the end of its next turn.</p></li></ul><p>Alternatively,
      as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your
      claim on That Which Spies From Infinity in exchange for its direct
      assistance. When you do so the parchment melts away into nothing and for
      the next minute the vision transforms into an eldritch ethereal tentacle
      within 30 feet.</p><p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to
      verbally instruct the tentacle to make a melee spell attack (+6 bonus to
      hit) against a target within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8
      cold damage and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your
      next turn.</p><p>Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can
      never invoke That Which Spies From Infinity’s true name again.</p>
