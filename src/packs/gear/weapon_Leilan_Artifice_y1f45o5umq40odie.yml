    value: >-
      <p>This silver contraption bears a slight resemblance to a crossbow but is
      stockier&mdash;it has a handle and trigger, then instead of a sliding
      stock there&rsquo;s a slot two inches across and one wide. A fat barrel
      covered in countless divine symbols protrudes parallel from the top of the
      handle, with a hollow opening at the far end from the stock.</p>

      <p>This weapon is known by a few other names&mdash; sunbuster, dayslinger,
      sungun&mdash;and is thought to be the only one of its kind. When filled
      with a crystal of distilled sunlight (page 234) and fired, the shining
      ammunition is transformed into sound. If you are proficient with any type
      of crossbow you are proficient with this weapon.</p>

      <p>The Leilan Artifice has a range of 50/150 feet, the loading property
      (each crystal of distilled sunlight is enough for 4 shots), and on a hit
      it deals thunder damage equal to 1d8 + your Dexterity modifier. On a
      successful ranged weapon attack against an undead, this weapon deals an
      extra 1d6 radiant damage.</p>

      <p>While you are attuned to this weapon, on your turn you can use an
      action to hold the trigger for a burst shot.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><em><strong>Burst Shot.</strong></em> Choose a creature or object
      within 100 feet and make a ranged weapon attack against it. On a hit, you
      deal thunder damage equal to 4d12 + your Dexterity modifier. Each creature
      in front of or behind your target and within 100 feet of you makes a
      Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to the result of your attack
      roll, taking 2d8 thunder damage on a failure. A burst shot consumes half a
      crystal of distilled sunlight.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Evil and undead creatures take 2d6 radiant damage when touching this
      weapon and cannot wield it.</p>
