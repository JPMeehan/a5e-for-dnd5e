      <p>This small clay pot contains about a pint of a single color of paint,
      enough to cover 50 square feet. Alternatively, as an action, you can
      splash the contents of this pot up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact.
      Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within 20 feet, treating
      the paint pot as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in
      bright paint. The paint can only be removed with at least 1 minute of
      vigorous scrubbing. While covered in paint, a creature has disadvantage on
      Stealth checks.</p>
