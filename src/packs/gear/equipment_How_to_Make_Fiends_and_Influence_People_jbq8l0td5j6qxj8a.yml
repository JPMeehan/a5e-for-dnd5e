      <p>The cracks in the deep green leather binding of this ancient book
      reveal an unwavering orange glow. After studying this book for 1 hour each
      day over the course of a year and a day, you gain permanent influence over
      one randomly determined humanoid on your plane, even if it is immune to
      being charmed. This otherwise functions as the <em>suggestion</em> spell
      (no saving throw). The target uses the statistics of a cambion (page 42 in
      the <em>Monstrous Menagerie</em>), but maintains its prior physical
      appearance. A <em>wish</em> spell, or the destruction of the book via
      <em>disintegrate</em> or similar magic, frees the creature from this
      effect.</p>
