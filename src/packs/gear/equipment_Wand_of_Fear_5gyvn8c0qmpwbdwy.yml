      of an infamous tyrant</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and
      command another creature to flee or grovel (as the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.bs1zn1s8ewwa4tfx]{Command} spell,
      save DC 15).</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the
      wand to emit a 60-foot cone of light. Each creature in the area makes a DC
      15 Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. A
      creature frightened in this way must spend its turns trying to move as far
      away from you as possible, and it can&rsquo;t willingly move to a space
      within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t take reactions. On its turn,
      the frightened creature can use only the Dash action or try to escape from
      an effect that prevents it from moving, or if it has nowhere to move then
      the Dodge action. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the
      end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

      <p>This wand has 7 charges and regains [[/r 1d6+1 #charges]] expended
      charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]].
      On a 1, the wand releases a chilling wail and crumbles into nothing. </p>
