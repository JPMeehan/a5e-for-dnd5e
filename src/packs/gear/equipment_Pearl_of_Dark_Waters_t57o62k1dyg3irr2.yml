      <p>This night-black pearl of surpassing quality is the size of an adult
      human&rsquo;s fist. Just under the surface, dark waters roil and churn.
      Once a golden pearl with the ability to purify waters and heal the most
      grievous of wounds, it was taken by the aboleth necromancer Tolamir and
      twisted to darker purposes.</p><p>The Pearl of Dark Waters is different
      from most magic items in that it is so closely-tied to its mistress. Any
      creature that is not Tolamir that touches the Pearl of Dark Waters takes
      49 (14d6) necrotic damage and suffers a level of strife, or half if they
      are Evil or undead. This damage is halved if the Pearl of Dark Waters is
      still sundered. Additionally, as long as both Tolamir and this artifact
      are on the same plane, she can remain attuned to it no matter the distance
      or duration of separation.</p><p>The Pearl of Dark Waters cannot be taken
      far from the open sea. If it is taken more than 50 miles inland from the
      coast (including on river ways) it evaporates, immediately reforming on
      the nearest beach.</p>
