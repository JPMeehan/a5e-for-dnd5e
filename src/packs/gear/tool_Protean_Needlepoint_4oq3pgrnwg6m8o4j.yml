      <p>Always pristine, easy to thread&mdash;and most importantly&mdash; able
      to change its size to suit any purpose, this miraculous sewing needle
      promises to always be the right tool for the job. The needle&rsquo;s exact
      size randomly changes every hour, but you can also choose the form it
      takes by spending 1 minute threading it with the proper filament.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong><em>Cotton (Sharp Needle).</em></strong> Perfect for delicate
      stitching, beading, and general use.</li>

      <li><em><strong>Silk (Embroidery Needle).</strong></em> Ideal for more
      decorative needlework.</li>

      <li><em><strong>Wool (Canvas Needle).</strong></em> Large and blunt, for
      bulkier, loosely woven material.</li>

      <li><strong><em>Leather (Glover Needle).</em></strong> Big, sharp, made
      for punching through thick hide.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The protean needlepoint can be used as an improvised weapon when it is
      sized as a canvas needle for wool (1 magical piercing damage) or a glover
      needle for leather (1d4 magical piercing damage). When you score a
      critical hit with it, the tip of the needle snaps off and it becomes a
      mundane item.</p>
