      <p><strong>Crafting Components</strong>: Empty vessel that once held a
      bound djinni</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While you are wearing this
      ring, you can use an action to speak its command word and choose an
      unoccupied space within 120 feet. You summon a djinni from the Elemental
      Plane of Air in that space. It is friendly to you and your companions, and
      obeys any command you give it, no matter what language you use. If you do
      not command it, the djinni takes no other actions but to defend itself.
      </p><p>The djinni remains for up to 1 hour as long as you concentrate (as
      if concentrating on a spell), or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. It
      then returns to its home plane. After the djinni departs, it cannot be
      summoned again for 24 hours. The ring  becomes nonmagical if the djinni
      dies.</p>
