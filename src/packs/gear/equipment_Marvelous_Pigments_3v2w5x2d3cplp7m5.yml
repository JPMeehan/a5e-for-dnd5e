      <p>This boxed set of iridescent paints can be used to create inanimate
      objects, terrain features, doors, and even rooms with nothing but the
      stroke of a brush. When you touch the brush to a surface and concentrate
      on the image of the item you want to create, the paint flows from the
      brush, creating a painting. When complete, the object depicted becomes a
      real, three-dimensional object.</p><ul><li><p>Small, simple objects take a
      single round. Larger objects, like doors or rooms, take more time. It
      takes 1 minute of concentration to cover 10 square feet of a surface, and
      10 minutes to cover 100 square feet of a surface. </p></li><li><p>Objects
      created by the pigment are real and nonmagicalâ€”a door painted on a wall
      can whatever lies beyond. A pit becomes a real pit (be sure and note the
      depth for your total area). A tree will bloom and
      grow.</p></li><li><p>Objects created by the pigments are worth a maximum
      of 25 gold. Gemstones or fine clothing created by these pigments might
      look authentic, but close inspection reveals they are facsimiles made from
      cheaper materials.</p></li><li><p>When found the box contains [[/r 1d4
      #pots]] pots of pigment.</p></li><li><p>A pot of pigment can cover 1,000
      square feet of a surface, creating a total area of 10,000 cubic feet of
      objects.</p></li><li><p>Energy created by the paints, such as a burst of
      radiant light or a wildfire, dissipates harmlessly and does not deal any
      damage.</p></li></ul>
