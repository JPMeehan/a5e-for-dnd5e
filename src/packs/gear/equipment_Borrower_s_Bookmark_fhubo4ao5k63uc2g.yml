      <p>A neat strap of embossed leather, the borrower’s bookmark can be placed
      in a book, allowing it to be stored in an extradimensional space. As an
      action you can send the book into a pocket dimension. While it is in the
      pocket dimension, you can use an action to summon it to your hand or an
      unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you unattune from the bookmark
      while its book is within the pocket dimension, the bookmark reappears on
      your person, but the book is lost. The bookmark’s magic can’t be used to
      store anything other than a book.</p><p><strong>Curse. </strong>The
      borrower’s bookmark is cursed. Books dismissed to the pocket dimension are
      sent to a powerful entity’s lair. The entity learns all the knowledge
      contained therein, as well as your identity and location.</p>
