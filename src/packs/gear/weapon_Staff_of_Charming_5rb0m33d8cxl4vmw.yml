      <blockquote><p>(Requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
      Warlock, or Wizard)</p></blockquote><p>While holding this magical
      quarterstaff you can use an action and expend charges to cast one of the
      following spells, using your spell save DC:</p><ul><li><p><em>Charm
      Person</em> (1 charge)</p></li><li><p><em>Command </em>(1
      charge)</p></li><li><p><em>Comprehend Languages</em> (1
      charge).</p></li></ul><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Once per dawn, when
      you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment
      spell, you can instead choose to succeed. When you succeed on a saving
      throw against an enchantment spell (with or without the staffâ€™s
      intervention) you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff
      and turn the spell back on its caster (targeting only them), as if you had
      cast the spell.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>The staff has 10
      charges and regains 1d8+2 expended charges each dawn.</p><p>When the last
      charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, it loses its magical
      properties.</p><hr><p><b>Parrying:</b> When you are wielding this weapon
      and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an
      expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by
      a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated ,
      paralyzed , rattled , restrained , or stunned.</p>
