      <p>This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. You can use an
      action to throw this flask up to 20 feet where it shatters on impact. Make
      a ranged weapon attack against a creature or object, treating the
      alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d6
      ongoing fire damage. This damage persists for 1 minute. A creature can end
      all ongoing damage being dealt by alchemist’s fires by using its action to
      either make a DC 14 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames or by dousing
      the target with at least 1 gallon of water.</p>
