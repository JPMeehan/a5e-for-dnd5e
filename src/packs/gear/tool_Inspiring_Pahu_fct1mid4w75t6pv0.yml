      <p>This large bass drum is made from hearty kamani (a wood light in color
      and native to far away islands) covered in cured sharkskin. Carvings all
      around the instrument depict warriors engaged in song and dance around a
      giant funeral pyre, and a leather strap hangs from its side to secure the
      drum at the waist. When struck the drum creates a deep resonant sound that
      sets the tempo for a song, an excellent tool for motivating warriors
      before battle. </p><p>This drum has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each
      dawn. You can use a bonus action to play it and expend 1 charge, focusing
      its energies on a living creature that has 0 hit points and that you can
      see within 20 feet. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has
      advantage on death saving throws. </p><p>Alternatively, you can use an
      action to play it and expend 2 charges. Each creature within 30 feet of
      you that hears you play makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a
      success, a creature gains inspiration. </p><p>If you expend the last
      charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the sharkskin membrane
      covering the drum breaks and it becomes a mundane item</p>
