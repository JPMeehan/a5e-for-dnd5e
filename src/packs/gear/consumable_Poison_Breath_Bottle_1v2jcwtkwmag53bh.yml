      <p>You can use an action to throw this green vial at a point within 20
      feet. The vial shatters on impact and creates a 5-foot-radius cloud of
      poison gas. A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a
      DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and become
      poisoned until the end of its next turn. The area inside the cloud is
      lightly obscured. The cloud remains for 1 minute or until a strong wind
      disperses it.</p>
