      u-my-md"><p>You gain an expertise die on Performance checks made to dance
      while you wear these finely-crafted boots.</p><p>As an action, you can
      transform your legs and feet into the furry haunches and cloven hooves of
      a goat. The transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you use another
      action to return to your normal form. While transformed, your Speed
      becomes 40 feet, you gain an expertise die on Acrobatics checks, and you
      ignore nonmagical difficult terrain. When the effect ends, the boots fall
      apart and become useless until a properly trained satyr cobbler repairs
      them for you.</p>
