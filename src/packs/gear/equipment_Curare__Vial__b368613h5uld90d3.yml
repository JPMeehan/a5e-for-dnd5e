    value: >-
      <p>You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing
      weapon, or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its
      potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When
      a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it makes a
      DC 13 Constitution saving throw or is stunned until the end of its next
      turn.</p><p>Applying a poison takes an action. A creature immune to the
      poisoned condition is immune to any effects from poisons.</p>
