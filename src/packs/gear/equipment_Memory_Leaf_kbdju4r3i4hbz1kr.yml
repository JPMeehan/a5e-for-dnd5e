      <p>Precious beyond reckoning, this silver leaf has fallen&nbsp;from a
      Memory Tree and contains a psychic imprint&nbsp;of the living creature it
      was once connected to. It&nbsp;can only be attuned when pressed against
      the forehead&nbsp;and is often set into a woven headband.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Legends and Lore</h2>

      <p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals&nbsp;the following:</p>

      <p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the Memory Leaf, which fell from a
      Memory Tree in ages past.</p>

      <p><strong>DC 18</strong> Sometimes those who wear the leaf sense those
      who have worn it before.</p>

      <p><strong>DC 21</strong> The leaf can grant knowledge about the ancient
      world.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Artifact Properties</h2>

      <p>The Memory Leaf has one lesser artifact benefit.&nbsp;There is a 50%
      chance when you attune to the leaf&nbsp;that you discover a lesser
      artifact detriment.</p>

      <p>In some cases the benefit and detriment are reflections of the former
      personality, and you may acquire those traits while attuned to it.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Magic</h2>

      <p>While this leaf is pressed against your forehead,&nbsp;you can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.24rmiwo0w5pd746x]{Legend Lore}
      to ask the psychic imprint within the leaf one question about the ancient
      world.&nbsp;Once you have used this property 3 times, it cannot&nbsp;be
      used again until next dawn.</p>
