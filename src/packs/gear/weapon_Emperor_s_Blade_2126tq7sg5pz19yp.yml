      <blockquote><p>Defensive (Medium)</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule
      u-my-md"><p>Spiked metal barbs line this +1 longsword, resembling the many
      rows of a sharkâ€™s teeth.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to speak a
      command word that activates or deactivates the barbs.</p><p>While
      activated, the barbs rapidly saw back and forth to tear into your foes,
      making your weapon attacks with the sword deal an extra 1d8 slashing
      damage.</p><p>When you score a critical hit while the barbs are active,
      the sawing barbs leave a terrible wound that deals 1d8 ongoing damage. At
      the start of each of its turns, a wounded creature makes a Constitution
      saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to
      end the ongoing damage.</p><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is
      designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light,
      medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using
      a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an
      attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start
      of your next turn.</p>
