      <p>This golden candlestick is sentient but will only light&nbsp;when held
      by someone it is friendly with&mdash;perhaps&nbsp;that someone is you.
      Whether or not the candlestick&nbsp;will accept you as an ally is at the
      Narrator&rsquo;s&nbsp;discretion, though it is highly recommended
      to&nbsp;keep it well-polished and speak to it once per day
      to&nbsp;encourage a long-lasting friendship. Once you have&nbsp;befriended
      the candlestick you are able to attune to it.</p><p>While you are attuned
      to the candlestick, you can use a bonus action to politely ask it to light
      itself or extinguish its flame. If another force extinguishes its flame,
      the candlestick relights itself at the start of your next turn unless told
      otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Hydrophobic.</strong></em> The candlestick
      does not like&nbsp;exposure to water or having its candle
      replaced,&nbsp;and when either occurs it stops functioning for&nbsp;you
      until you make a DC 14 Persuasion check&nbsp;to earn its
      forgiveness.</p><p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The candlestick is
      a sentient&nbsp;construct with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 10,
      and&nbsp;Charisma 18. It has hearing and darkvision to&nbsp;a range of 120
      feet. The candlestick communicates&nbsp;with you telepathically and can
      speak and&nbsp;understand Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and&nbsp;Halfling. It
      cannot read (or perhaps it is simply&nbsp;disinterested in doing
      so).</p><p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The candlestick&rsquo;s
      purpose is to&nbsp;provide ample lighting for its wielder and
      snuff&nbsp;itself out should the cover of darkness be required.&nbsp;It is
      sympathetic to those in need of assistance but&nbsp;demands to be treated
      with a certain amount of&nbsp;respect and appreciation for its
      service.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Candlestick.</strong></em> When
      reduced to 0 hit points, the candlestick pours its remaining heart and
      soul into creating one last burst of flames before becoming a mundane
      item. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the candlestick
      must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
