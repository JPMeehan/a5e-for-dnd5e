      <p>At a glance this item seems to be perfectly typical, but it conceals a
      spring-loaded blade deployed by pressing a switch when it is used to make
      an attack.</p><p>A creature observing it only realizes that the item is a
      weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the
      weapon is being worn at the time and not deployed).</p><p>Once deployed, a
      bonus action is required to re-sheathe the blade. You gain an expertise
      die on your attack roll when you deploy this weapon as part of an attack
      against a target that is unaware you have it.</p><p></p><p>When you roll a
      natural 20 on an attack roll using this weapon it deals an extra 2d6
      damage of the weapon's type (this extra damage does not
      double).</p><hr><p><b>Stealthy:</b> This armor or weapon has been
      disguised to look like a piece of clothing or other normal item. A
      creature observing the item only realizes that it is armor or a weapon
      with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the armor is
      being worn at the time or the weapon is sheathed).</p>
