      <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      maul. This weapon can only be attuned to when you are wearing a belt of
      giant strength and gauntlets of ogre power. The attunement ends if you
      remove or change attunement away from either of those items.</p>

      <p>While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Your Strength score increases by 4 (and can exceed 20, but not
      30).</li>

      <li>When you make an attack roll with this weapon against a giant and roll
      a natural 20, the giant makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or
      dies.</li>

      <li>You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the maul
      with a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet. On a hit,
      the maul unleashes a thunderclap heard from up to 300 feet away. The
      target and every creature within 30 feet of it make a DC 17 Constitution
      saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The maul has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each
      dawn.</p><hr><p><b>Breaker:</b> This weapon deals double damage to
      unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies
      to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis
      after this property.</p>
