    value: >-
      <p>This crossbow has a large winding wheel affixed to its drawstring which
      feeds into extra machinery along the stock that catches and pulls the
      string back again after it is fired. </p><p>Winding a ratcheting crossbow
      for a single bolt requires a bonus action or action, and it can be wound
      to prepare two bolts. Masterwork ratcheting crossbows can be prepared to
      fire up to four bolts, or be constructed smaller (with statistics like a
      hand crossbow).</p>
