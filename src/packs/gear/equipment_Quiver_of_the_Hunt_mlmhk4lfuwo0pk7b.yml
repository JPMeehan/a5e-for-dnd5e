      <p>While attuned to and wearing this ornate quiver, you can draw arrows,
      bolts, or sling stones as part of taking the Attack action with a bow,
      crossbow, or sling, producing an endless supply of missiles. The
      ammunition disappears upon impact, hit or miss, and disappears if passed
      to another creature to fire.</p>
