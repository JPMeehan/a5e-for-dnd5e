      <p>These precision instruments allow you to relate your position to the
      position of the stars. So long as you are on the Material Plane and can
      freely observe the stars, once per night you can make a navigator’s tools
      check. On a result of 15–19 you learn one of the following pieces of
      information, or two pieces of information on a result of 20 or
      higher:</p><ul><li><p>The approximate time of year</p></li><li><p>Your
      approximate distance from the equator (assuming the world has a known
      axis).</p></li><li><p>Your approximate distance from the place you last
      made this check.</p></li><li><p>Your current distance from a major
      landmark and the approximate amount of time it will take to reach
      it.</p></li></ul>
