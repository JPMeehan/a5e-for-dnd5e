      <p>Some say these enchanted gems take their name from a deity of
      knowledge, others that they are named for the sound they make as they
      gently orbit their bearer’s head. Whatever the case, there are many types
      of ioun stones, each imbued with powerful beneficial magic.</p><p>The
      specifics of these stones vary but they all work in essentially the same
      way: once you have attuned to it you can use an action to set a stone in a
      gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature
      may use an action to try and take an orbiting stone, but must make a melee
      attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. An ioun
      stone’s AC is 24, it has 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage.
      While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an
      action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive
      state.</p><p>This radiant indigo prism encases a pearl and can store
      spells for later use. The stone can hold up to 3 spell levels and is
      typically found with 1d4 – 1 levels of stored spells.</p><p>To store a
      spell in the stone, a creature must cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell
      while holding it. The spell is drawn into the stone with no other effect.
      If there aren’t enough available levels to hold a spell, it cannot be
      stored.</p><p>While the stone is orbiting you, you can cast any spell
      stored in it using the appropriate action. The spell uses the spell level,
      spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the creature that
      stored the spell, but you are considered to be the caster. Once a spell is
      cast, it is no longer stored.</p>
