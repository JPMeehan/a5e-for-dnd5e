      <p>Created by a dwarven prospector who made it his lifeâ€™s goal to map out
      as many of the deepest dungeons and tunnels as he possibly could, this
      tattered piece of parchment has a display of words and diagrams on it that
      is in constant flux.</p><p>When you attune to the map, the words change to
      the language of your choosing.</p><p>Whenever you examine the map, you can
      immediately find north no matter where you are, so long as you are on a
      plane of existence that has traditional cardinal directions</p><p> When
      you speak a command word etched on the back corner of the map while you
      are underground, you recall the memory of the dwarven prospector embarking
      on what he feared to be his last expedition, delving so deep that he
      thought he might never return. When this happens, the map shows you the
      direction to the largest cache of treasure (measured in number of coins
      and jewels) within 1 mile.</p><p>The map shows you passageways relevant to
      your destination and gives you advantage on ability checks to find secret
      doors, but does not note the location of monsters or traps.</p><p>The
      information on the map disappears after your next long rest, at which
      point all writing vanishes from the parchment and it becomes a mundane
      item.</p>
