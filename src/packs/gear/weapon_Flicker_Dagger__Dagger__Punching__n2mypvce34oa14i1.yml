      <p>While you are attuned to and wielding this dagger, you can use a bonus
      action to summon a flickering illusion for 1 minute.</p><p>Your flickering
      illusion shares your space, moves with you, and is treated as another
      enemy of the target for the purposes of the Sneak Attack feature, but it
      cannot be targeted with attacks and provides no penalties to creatures
      attacking you.</p><p>Once you have used this property, you cannot do so
      again until you finish a long rest.</p><hr><p><b>Hand-Mounted:</b> This
      weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as
      climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage on
      saving throws made to resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is
      wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket,
      using thievesâ€™ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen
      components.</p>
