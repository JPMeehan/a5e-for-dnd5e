      <p>You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and blow it,
      emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet
      away. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
      On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for
      1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t
      deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage
      on the saving throw and take double damage. </p><p>Each use of the horn’s
      magic has a 20% chance of making it explode, dealing 10d6 fire damage to
      you and destroying it.</p>
