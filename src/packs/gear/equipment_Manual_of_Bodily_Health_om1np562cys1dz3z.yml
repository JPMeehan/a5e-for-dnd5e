      <p>This magical book contains surprisingly accurate advice on building
      endurance. Spending 48 hours over 6 days (or fewer) reading and following
      the book’s advice increases your Constitution score and your maximum
      Constitution score by 2. The manual then becomes a mundane item for a
      century before it regains its magic.</p>
