      <p>Every trip to sea can become boring and one of the best ways to whittle
      away at the time — besides drinking rum—is to engage in a game of bones.
      Not every sailor on the high seas is honest and these dice were crafted
      with the devious amongst them in mind.</p><p>Each four-sided die is made
      from bleached white whale bone and inlaid with jet-black markings. No
      matter how many times they are thrown or the number of ship hulls they
      strike, the dice never nick or scuff, and their markings do not
      fade.</p><p>The dice have 2 charges and regain 1 charge each
      dawn.</p><p>When you speak the command word as a bonus action as the dice
      are being rolled, their results come up as double ones (or
      snake-eyes).</p><p>If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result
      of 5 or less, the dice will roll up as double ones but both dice then
      crack in half rendering them useless.</p>
