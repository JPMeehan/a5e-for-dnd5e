      a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block it and sacrifice your
      shield, turning the critical hit into a regular hit. Afterwards your
      shield is broken, or if your shield is magical it instead becomes mundane
      for 1 hour.</p><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>While this heavy metal
      shield is equipped you have advantage on saving throws made against spells
      and magical effects, and spell attacks against you have disadvantage.</p>
