      <p>This legendary weapon is said to grant powerful magic to its wielder
      and that only the rightful ruler of the land is suitable to carry it into
      battle.</p><p>While you are attuned to it, Excalibur grants you the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>If you are the rightful wielder of
      Excalibur, it instantly attunes to you and does not take up an attunement
      slot.</p></li><li><p>You gain a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
      with this weapon.</p></li><li><p>When you attack an object with this magic
      sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the
      target.</p></li><li><p>When you attack a creature with this weapon and
      roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing
      damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the
      target’s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the Narrator.
      If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body
      instead.</p></li><li><p>You can speak the sword’s command word to cause
      the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an
      additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword
      puts out the light.</p></li><li><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points
      but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t
      use this property again until you finish a long rest.</p></li><li><p>You
      have advantage on Insight and Persuasion checks made against anyone but
      creatures you consider to be your close allies and
      companions.</p></li></ul><hr><p><b>Defensive:</b> This weapon is designed
      to be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium,
      or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield
      designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with
      your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
