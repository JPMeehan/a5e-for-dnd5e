      <p>Shadows writhe underneath this cloak. While attuned to and wearing this
      incredibly dark cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks
      made to hide in dim light or darkness. </p><p>In addition, you can use an
      action to animate your shadow for up to 1 hour. While animated, you can
      see and hear through your shadowâ€™s senses and control it telepathically.
      If your shadow is slain while animated, your shadow disappears until the
      new moon, during which time the cloak becomes nonmagical. Once you have
      used this property, you cannot do so again until the next dawn. </p>
