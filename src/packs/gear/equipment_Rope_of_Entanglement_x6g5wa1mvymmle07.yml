      <p>You can use an action to speak a command word while holding one end of
      this rope, making the other end attempt to entangle a creature you can see
      within 20 feet of you. The creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
      or is restrained on a failure. You can use a bonus action to speak another
      command word and release any creatures entangled by the rope. </p><p>An
      entangled creature can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity
      check (the creatureâ€™s choice), escaping the rope on a success. </p><p>The
      rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. It has AC 20 and 20 hit points,
      recovering 1 hit point every 5 minutes when damaged. The rope is destroyed
      when reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
