      <p>This salty chewing gum is made from the sap of a deep sea plant and is
      normally stored inside of a clamshell. In order to activate it, you must
      chew the gum as an action, during which its properties are released into
      your bloodstream. The center of your forehead forms a slight bump and
      begins to glow. Any darkness within a range of 120 feet becomes dim light,
      and any dim light within the same range becomes bright light. The gum has
      no effect on bright light.</p><p>The effect lasts for 1 hour, after which
      the gum loses its magical properties. The gum itself is a bit of an
      acquired taste and when you chew it for the first time you must make a DC
      10 Constitution check or gain the stunned condition for a round as you
      vomit. Vomited gum can be retrieved and used again, but its remaining
      duration is halved every time it is reused.</p><p>Luminescent gum is
      generally found in bunches of 6 or 12 clamshells.</p>
