      <p>This map was used by the dwarves of Deephall Point to flee
      Cirothe&rsquo;s assault on their homeland but it is not simply a drawing
      of a secret route (though it is that, too), it is a powerful artifact that
      helps any fleeing danger to find their refuge.</p>

      <p>While holding the map, you can gaze into it and envision a place you
      want to go. The map then depicts a path to that destination that is as
      free of danger as possible. The terrain, features, and route all appear as
      if some unseen hand is drawing it in front of your eyes making it
      impossible for you to become lost. In addition, once per day the map shows
      where you are likely to have a random encounter (allowing you to avoid the
      area altogether).</p>

      <p>DESTRUCTION</p>

      <p>If you are in possession of the map and take fire damage from the
      breath weapon of a red dragon, you automatically fail your Dexterity
      saving throw and the map is destroyed. Otherwise the relic cannot be
      damaged.</p>
