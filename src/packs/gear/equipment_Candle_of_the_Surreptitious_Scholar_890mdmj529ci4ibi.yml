      <p>Initially crafted by wizard apprentices trying not to irritate their
      roommates, these candles became extremely popular with the thieves and
      other ne’erdo-wells that can afford them (helping some less scrupulous
      novice mages to afford tuition). The candle has 3 charges and regains 1d3
      charges each dawn.</p><p>When you speak the command word and use an action
      to expend 1 charge, the candle’s flame to spring to life. Its bluish flame
      provides clear illumination within 5 feet and dim light for another 5
      feet. The enchantment of the candle is such that the light that it sheds
      is visible only to you, allowing you to read, write, or engage in other
      tasks with no penalties from darkness. Each charge is good for 1 hour of
      illumination, after which the candle winks out.</p><p>By expending all 3
      charges at once, you can create an effect identical to <em>light</em>
      except that only you are able to see the light it sheds.</p><p>If you
      expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the candle
      loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
