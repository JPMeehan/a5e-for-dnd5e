      <p>Once you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel
      ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the
      center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such
      as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the
      plate makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or it takes 2d4 piercing damage
      and stops moving. On a failed save, until the creature breaks free of the
      trap its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet
      long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check,
      freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each
      failed check deals 1d4 piercing damage to the trapped creature. Hunting
      traps of higher quality are more complex and effective, increasing the DC
      of each saving throw and ability check (by 2 for fine hunting traps, or by
      4 for masterwork hunting traps).</p>
