      <p>This ornately-carved book stand&rsquo;s supports are carved like a pair
      of feathered wings. When a command is spoken, the book stand&rsquo;s
      wing-like supports become a pair of feathery wings and it takes flight
      along with any book it currently holds. It will follow you, keeping the
      book at a convenient height for reading. The book stand has a maximum
      flight speed of 100 feet. If you are moving faster than the book stand can
      follow, it will follow as closely as it is able and attempt to catch up as
      rapidly as it can when you slow or cease your movement. The book stand can
      support a book weighing up to 10 pounds and still fly.</p>
