      <blockquote><p>This crystal phial appears empty unless it is agitated,
      which reveals that it is filled to the brim with a clear liqueur. Close
      examination reveals bubbles within the liquid that seem to be shaped like
      tiny skulls.</p></blockquote><hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md"><p>Pouring the
      phialâ€™s contents into the mouth of a dead creature animates it as if it
      were the target of a <em>speak with dead</em> spell.</p>
