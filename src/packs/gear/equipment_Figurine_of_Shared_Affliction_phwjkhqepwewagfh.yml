      <p>This small wooden figurine was crafted as a special totem used by a
      healer whose magic allowed him to absorb other people’s afflictions into
      his own body.</p><p>The item changes shape, taking on your rough
      appearance when you attune to it.</p><p>While carrying the figurine on
      your person, you have advantage on the first Medicine check you make to
      treat a disease or poison. Only one creature per day can use the figurine
      in this manner.</p><p>When you successfully treat an affliction, the
      figurine takes on a sickly visage as it absorbs the disease or poison. The
      figurine of shared affliction grants no benefits until it returns to its
      normal appearance at the end of your next long rest.</p><p>When you would
      be reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to relive the last
      memory of the healer who created the totem, in which they gave their life
      to absorb a deadly illness that infected their kin. When this happens, for
      the next minute you have advantage on death saves.</p><p>The figurine
      shows the effects of the attacks you’ve suffered in gruesome detail before
      reverting to a featureless wooden carving and forever losing its
      magic.</p>
