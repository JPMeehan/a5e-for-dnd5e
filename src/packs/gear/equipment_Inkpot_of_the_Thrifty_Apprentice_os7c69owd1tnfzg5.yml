      <p>This appears to be nothing more than a mundane pot of ink. When you
      speak the command word and use a bonus action to expend 1 charge, it fills
      with enough high quality and particularly durable ink of the color of your
      choice to fill 50 pages of parchment. This ink is extremely hard to remove
      from any surface, including cloth or flesh, and often takes many days and
      washings to clean away. The ink cannot be used to inscribe spells, and
      when removed from the pot with anything but a quill the ink instantly
      dries. </p><p>When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges
      as an action, a 15-foot cone of ink erupts from the inkpot, coating
      anything and everything that it hits. Creatures in the area make a DC 10
      Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature is blinded until it
      spends an action cleaning the ink away from its eyes. </p><p>The inkpot
      has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last
      charge, roll a d20. On a 5 or less, the inkpot loses its magic and becomes
      a mundane item</p>
