    value: >-
      <p>These matched glass rings shimmer from a stitch of eldritch energy that
      runs through their center. They contain some residual memories of the
      cleric and herald who originally wore the bands, relying on the enchanted
      jewelry as much as each other through many adventures together. When you
      and another creature attune to the rings, you each gain the ability to
      sense your approximate distance from one another. You also receive a
      slight jolt when the other ring wearer drops to 0 hit points.</p><p>When
      the other ring wearer takes damage, you can use your reaction to
      concentrate and rotate the ring. When you do so, both you and the other
      ring wearer receive an image of an elderly herald giving up her life to
      shield her cleric companion from enemy arrows. The effect, spell, or
      weaponâ€™s damage dice are rolled twice and use the lower result. After
      being used in this way, the energy in each ring disappears and they both
      become mundane items.</p>
