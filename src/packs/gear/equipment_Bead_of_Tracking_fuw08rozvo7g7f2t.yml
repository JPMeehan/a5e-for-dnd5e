      <p>This miniature bead is covered with hundreds of small hooks. When you
      use an action to place it on a creature’s clothing or hide, the bead hangs
      there imperceptibly and creates a bond between you and the creature. You
      gain an expertise die on checks made to track the creature while the bead
      remains on it.</p><p>To place the bead during combat without being
      noticed, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against
      the creature’s maneuver DC (or when outside of combat, the creature’s
      passive Perception).</p>
