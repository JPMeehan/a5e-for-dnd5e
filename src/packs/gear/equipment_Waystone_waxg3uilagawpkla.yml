      <p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Stone kept in a traveler&rsquo;s
      pocket for a journey of at least 100 miles</p>

      <hr class="a5e-rule u-my-md">

      <p>This rounded oval stone has a metallic gray luster. When one or more
      <em>waystones </em>are kept in contact for an hour or longer, they become
      paired and magnetically attracted to each other for 1 week per hour spent
      in contact. Paired <em>waystones </em>are ideal for use as trail markers,
      for tracking purposes, or to prevent yourself from becoming lost. You can
      use an action to speak its command word, making the waystone sense and be
      drawn toward the nearest waystone within 5 miles, or if it is paired to
      another waystone within range, the paired <em>waystone</em>. Paired
      <em>waystones</em> are only able to sense each other.</p>

      <p>A <em>waystone </em>has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You
      may expend 1 charge when speaking its command word to increase the
      <em>waystone&rsquo;s </em>range to 25 miles, or if the <em>waystone
      </em>is paired, to sense the nearest unpaired <em>waystone </em>within 5
      miles. When used in either manner, the <em>waystone&rsquo;s
      </em>attraction lasts until the next dawn. If you expend the last charge,
      the <em>waystone </em>becomes a mundane item. </p>
