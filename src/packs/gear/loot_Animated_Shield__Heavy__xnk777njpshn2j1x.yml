      As a bonus action, you can verbally command the shield to animate and
      float in your space, or for it to stop doing so. The shield continues to
      act as if you were wielding it, but with your hands free. The shield
      remains animated for 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated or die. It
      then returns to your free hand, if you have one, or else it falls to the
      ground. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
