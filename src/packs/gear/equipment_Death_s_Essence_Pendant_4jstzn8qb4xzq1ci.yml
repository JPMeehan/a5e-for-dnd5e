      <p>You can use an action to activate this small black pendant, making any
      undead of CR 1 or lower indifferent to you and creatures you choose within
      30 feet of you. The undead remain indifferent until you threaten or harm
      them. </p><p>The pendant has 5 charges and regains 1d4 charges each day at
      dawn. Three times each day you can use a bonus action and expend a charge
      to summon a skeleton (page 334 or zombie (page 335). Your summoned
      creature follows you and is hostile to creatures that are hostile to you.
      You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its
      next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area.
      If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead
      continues to follow a command until its task is complete.</p>
