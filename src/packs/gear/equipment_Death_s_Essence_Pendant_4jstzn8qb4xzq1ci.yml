      regains 1d4 charges each day at dawn.</p>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap;
      transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.9s;
      transition-delay: 0.352326s;">You can use an action and expend a charge to
      make undead of CR 1 or lower indifferent to you and creatures you choose
      within 30 feet of you. Undead remain indifferent until you for up to 1
      hour, or until you threaten or harm them.</p>

      <p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap;
      transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.9s;
      transition-delay: 0.35407s;">Three times each day you can use a bonus
      action and expend a charge to summon a skeleton or zombie. Your summoned
      creature follows you and is hostile to creatures that are hostile to you.
      You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its
      next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area.
      If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead
      continues to follow a command until its task is complete. Undead created
      by the pendant turn into dust at dawn.</p>
