      <p>This set of novelty glasses has a comically-oversized false nose along
      with a thick fake mustache and bushy eyebrows. These glasses have 3
      charges and regain 1 charge each dawn. While wearing the glasses you can
      expend 1 charge to cast the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.vemj08hawvmf44ya]{Disguise
      Self} (save DC 14).</p><p>However, you cannot mask the glasses themselves
      using disguise self in this way&mdash;no matter how your disguise looks,
      it includes the novelty glasses.</p><p>If you expend the last charge, roll
      a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the perfect disguise is glued to your
      face (as
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.fhi2dhlr4jugr1qj]{Sovereign
      Glue}) and it becomes a mundane item.</p>
