      <p>This sword&rsquo;s blade is plated with alchemical silver, its hilt
      stylized to resemble an open book from which the blade emerges. Despite
      its masterfully-crafted appearance, however, a cipher sword is
      uncomfortable to hold and strangely unwieldy. It has the two-handed and
      heavy properties and deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, but you feel this
      is only a fraction of its potential.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse.</strong> There are other cipher swords owned by a
      variety of creatures across the planes. Most wielders consider themselves
      part of an exclusive group and expect the loyalty and cooperation of those
      with less mastery, regardless of other alliances. Attaining even a novice
      level of mastery attracts the attention of other wielders, who may have
      expectations of you.</p>

      <p>The cipher sword also has the following properties:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You are not considered proficient with this weapon.</li>

      <li>While wielding this weapon, you don&rsquo;t benefit from any feature
      that would grant you additional attacks.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><em><strong>Escalation.</strong></em> This weapon is immensely powerful
      for those willing to solve the riddle of its use. Once per week, if
      you&rsquo;ve successfully reduced a dangerous enemy (as determined by the
      Narrator) to 0 hit points with it since the last time you finished a long
      rest, make a DC 14 Intelligence check to meditate on the sword&rsquo;s
      secrets. On a failure, you gain +1 to future attempts at this check. On a
      success, your level of mastery increases, you lose any bonus gained from
      failed attempts, the DC to advance again increases by 4, and the time
      between attempts increases by 1 week. If you ever willingly end your
      attunement to this weapon, you take 8 (4d4) psychic damage that cannot be
      negated or reduced and lose all mastery you&rsquo;ve gained.</p>

      <p>The levels of mastery are as follows:</p>

      <p><em>Novice:</em> You now are proficient with this weapon, and it gains
      the finesse property. However, wielding anything else begins to feel wrong
      to you, and you suffer disadvantage on all melee weapon attacks made with
      a different weapon.</p>

      <p><em>Apprentice:</em> You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls with this
      weapon. You can also now attack twice, instead of once, when you take the
      Attack action with this weapon on your turn. Additionally, you now suffer
      disadvantage on all weapon attacks with other weapons.</p>

      <p><em>Expert:</em> Your bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon
      increases to +2 and it gains the Vicious property. When you make a weapon
      attack with a different weapon, you now also take 4 (2d4) psychic damage.
      This damage cannot be negated or reduced by any means.</p>

      <p><em>Master:</em> Your bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon
      increases to +3, and you can summon it to your hand as a bonus action so
      long as you are on the same plane as it. Additionally, once per short
      rest, when you successfully attack a creature with it, you immediately
      learn about any special defenses or weaknesses that creature possesses as
      the blade imparts the wisdom of previous wielders. Additionally, the
      psychic damage you take from making a weapon attack with a different
      weapon increases to 8 (4d4).</p>
