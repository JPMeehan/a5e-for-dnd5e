      <p>Your prolonged captivity has granted you insight into the culture that
      kept you. You understand their customs, traditions, religion, political
      ties, and to some extent how they think. You are regarded as an expert in
      this culture and can usually recall some useful detail when you and your
      companions face a challenge involving this culture.</p>
