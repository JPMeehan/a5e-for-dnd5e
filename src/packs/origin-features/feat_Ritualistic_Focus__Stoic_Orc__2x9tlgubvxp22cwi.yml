      <p>Many of the stoic rituals you learned have broader arcane applications.
      You know two 1st-level spells of your choice. These spells must have the
      ritual tag and you may only cast them as rituals. Wisdom is your
      spellcasting ability for these spells. In addition, you may cast other
      spells you learn as rituals if those spells have the ritual tag.&nbsp;</p>
