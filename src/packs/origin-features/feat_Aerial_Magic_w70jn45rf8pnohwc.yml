      <p>You know the mage hand cantrip, and when you cast it the hand is
      invisible, replaced by a faintly glowing wind. You can use this trait once
      between long rests to cast one spell, chosen from air wave, feather fall,
      or floating disk. Once you reach 3rd level, you can do so twice between
      long rests. Your spellcasting ability for these is your choice of
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>
