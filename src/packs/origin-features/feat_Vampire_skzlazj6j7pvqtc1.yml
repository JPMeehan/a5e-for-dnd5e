      <p>You&rsquo;ve drank from the cup of the blood lords, but your powers are
      only just awakening. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Fanged Bite.</strong>&nbsp;The bite is a natural weapon, which
      you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal equal to 1d4 piercing
      damage. Attack and damage rolls with your bite use your choice of
      Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution modifiers.</p>

      <p>While you or your target are bloodied, you gain an expertise die on
      these attack rolls.</p>

      <p><strong>Blood Feasting.</strong> As part of a short rest, you can sink
      your teeth into the corpse of a Humanoid which has died within the past
      hour and drain it of blood. At the end of that rest, you regain a number
      of hit dice equal to your proficiency modifier (never exceeding your hit
      dice maximum). A corpse can be used for this trait no more than once. Once
      you have used this trait to regain a number of hit dice equal to your
      character level, you can&rsquo;t gain any more until you complete a long
      rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Wall Creeper.</strong> You have a climbing speed equal to your
      walking speed. At 3rd level, you are under a constant
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.kz3xe6ems34f2ubo]{Spider Climb}
      effect, which cannot be detected or dispelled by means short of a wish
      spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Special.</strong> This heritage gift counts as meeting the
      prerequisites for the Newblood synergy feat. Both of your bite attacks'
      damage increases per the benefits of the feat and those in its sequence,
      and they both use the best of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
      modifiers for attack and damage rolls.</p>
