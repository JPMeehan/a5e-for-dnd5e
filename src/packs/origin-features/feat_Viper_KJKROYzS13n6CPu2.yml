      <p>Some sinuous have dagger-like fangs and venom sacs. These sinuous are
      likely to have viper-like physical traits such as a cobra&rsquo;s hood or
      a rattle on the end of their tail. You have the following traits:</p>

      <p><em><strong>Venomous Bite.</strong></em> You have a venomous bite. As
      an action, you can attack with your bite (which is considered a finesse
      weapon) dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + ability modifier and poison
      damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Rapid Bite.</strong></em> You can also bite much faster,
      forgoing the opportunity to inject venom. You may make a bite attack as a
      bonus action, dealing 1d4 points of piercing damage + your ability
      modifier (but no poison).</p>

      <p><em><strong>Poison Resistance.</strong></em> You are resistant to
      poison damage and have advantage on saves to avoid the poisoned
      condition.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Menacing Viper.</strong></em> You gain proficiency with the
      Intimidation skill.</p>
