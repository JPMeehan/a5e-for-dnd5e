      <p>You can create a ramshackle version of a cart or wagon with 30 minutes
      of work if you have access to raw or reclaimed materials. Ramshackle
      vehicles created in this way function identically to their normal
      counterparts, except their gold piece value is always 0, they have half as
      many hit points as their normal counterparts, and they break and become
      useless if they are hit by any attack roll with a result of natural
      20.</p>
