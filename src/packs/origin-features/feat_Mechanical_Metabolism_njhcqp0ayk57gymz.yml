      <p>Certain types of healing are less effective or even wholly ineffective.
      Sources of nonmagical healing&nbsp;other than taking a rest have no
      effect.&nbsp;Magical healing only restores half as&nbsp;many hit points as
      normal unless you are&nbsp;also repaired in the same round (with
      an&nbsp;Engineering check, the mending cantrip,&nbsp;or similar).</p>

      <p>In addition, you don&rsquo;t require Supply&nbsp;in the typical sense;
      instead of eating&nbsp;food, you rely on a specific substance
      to&nbsp;refuel. Every 24 hours without the&nbsp;substance you suffer a
      level of fatigue and&nbsp;strife as your inner machinations begin
      to&nbsp;decay.</p>

      <p>Select one of the following.&nbsp;</p>

      <ul>

      <li><em>Combustibles:</em> 1 pound of coal or&nbsp;hemp, or 2 pounds of
      wood.</li>

      <li><em>Darkness:</em> 2 hours of complete darkness.</li>

      <li><em>Liquid: </em>1 flask of lamp oil, grease, or an alchemical liquid
      of your choice.</li>

      <li><em>Metal: </em>1 pound of copper or roughly 50 copper pieces. The
      Narrator may also allow you to consume silver, gold, or other precious
      metal in an amount of equivalent worth instead.</li>

      <li><em>Sunlight: </em>3 hours of full sunlight or 6 hours of partial
      (shaded or cloudy) sunlight.</li>

      </ul>
