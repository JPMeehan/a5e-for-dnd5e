      <p>Drawing upon great reservoirs of draconic power, you can unleash
      magical destruction upon your foes. You can use your dragon breath as an
      action.</p><p>Choose the type of damage dealt by your breath weapon from
      the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison,
      psychic, radiant, or thunder.</p><p>Additionally, choose between a 30-foot
      line that is 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone for the area that your breath
      weapon affects. Each creature in the breath&rsquo;s area makes a Dexterity
      saving throw . If your breath weapon deals psychic damage, a Wisdom saving
      throw is made instead of Dexterity; if cold, necrotic, poison, radiant, or
      thunder, a Constitution saving throw . The DC for this saving throw equals
      8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><p>A creature
      takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw, and half damage on a success.
      The damage increases to 3d6 at 4th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at 14th
      level, and 6d6 at 19th level.</p><p>After you use your dragon breath, you
      can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest</p>
