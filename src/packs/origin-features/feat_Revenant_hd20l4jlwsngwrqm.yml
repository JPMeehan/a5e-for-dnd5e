      <p>You are a restless corpse driven by revenge&mdash;or some other matter
      for which you would give up eternity. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Death Offers No Rest.&nbsp;</strong>A year and one day after
      obtaining this gift, or once you complete your Destiny, you are doomed.
      Until then you gain the following benefits:&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn,
      you regain 1 hit point. However, when you spend hit dice during a short
      rest, you only recover half as many hit points as normal.</p>

      <p>If you die, you return to "life" 24 hours after death. If your body is
      destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot
      determined by the Narrator, possibly by requisitioning an unused corpse.
      If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain
      it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Relentless Pursuit.</strong> Work with your Narrator to select
      one creature involved in your Destiny (your object of revenge, subject of
      devotion, etc.). You can spend 1 minute focusing on that creature. If the
      creature is dead or on another plane of existence, you learn that.
      Otherwise, after focusing, you know the distance and direction to that
      creature.</p>
