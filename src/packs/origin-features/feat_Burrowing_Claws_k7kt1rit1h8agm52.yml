      <p>You have the following traits:</p>

      <p><strong>Burrow. </strong>You have a burrowing speed of 10 feet. You can
      use your burrowing speed to move through nonmagical sand, loose earth,
      loamy soil, mud, or snow, but not solid rock. You do not naturally leave
      any sort of tunnel behind but you can attempt to create a 5-foot by 5-foot
      wide tunnel in earth, soil, or snow by spending extra time and effort
      shoring it up and adding support. This reduces your burrowing speed to 5
      feet every 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Claws. </strong>Your nails grow into strong&nbsp;shovel-like
      claws. The claws are natural&nbsp;weapons, which you can use to
      make&nbsp;unarmed strikes that deal slashing&nbsp;damage equal to 1d4 +
      your Strength&nbsp;modifier.</p>
