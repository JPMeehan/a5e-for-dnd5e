      <p>Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining
      conscious (the Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While
      meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental
      exercises that became reflexive through years of practice.</p><p>When you
      take a long rest, you spend 4 hours in your trance state (instead of
      sleeping for 6 hours). During the trance you suffer no penalty to passive
      Perception. A long rest remains 8 hours for you as normal, and the
      remainder of the time must be filled only with light activity.</p>
