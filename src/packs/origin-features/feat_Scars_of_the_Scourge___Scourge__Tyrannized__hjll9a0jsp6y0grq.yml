      <p>As a bonus action, you can enhance the next attack you make this turn.
      If that attack hits, it deals extra damage of the chosen type equal to
      your proficiency bonus. However, the sting of the scourge lessens after
      the initial strike, so after you deal this extra damage to a creature,
      this trait cannot deal extra damage to it during the same combat.</p>
