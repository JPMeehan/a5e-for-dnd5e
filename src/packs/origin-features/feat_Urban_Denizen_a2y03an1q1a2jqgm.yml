      <p>You know your way around big cities, and know how to find people in
      urban locations. You can make an Investigation check to learn the location
      of (or at the Narratorâ€™s discretion gain a helpful clue to the trail of) a
      person by discreetly asking around in the right places. The difficulty of
      the check is DC 15 if the individual is not hiding, or DC 20 if they are
      trying to conceal their location.</p>
