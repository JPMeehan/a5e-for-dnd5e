      <p>As a fellow or friend of several universities you have visiting access
      to the great libraries, most of which are off-limits to the general
      public. With enough time spent in a library, you can uncover most of the
      answers you seek (any question answerable with a DC 20 Arcana, Culture,
      Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p>
