  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As part of a long rest, you can designate one willing mount to be
      bonded with your spirit, which lasts until you or that creature dies, or
      until you designate a different one. While riding on your bonded mount, if
      it is untrained you can still control it as if it were trained. If this
      creature is a horse, it gains spell resistance (advantage on saving throws
      against spells).</p>
