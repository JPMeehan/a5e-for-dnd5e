      <p>Your lower body has the shape of a massive, powerful snake. This grants
      you the following advantages:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You are immune to the Prone condition while in contact with the
      ground. If you are knocked prone while flying, you fall as normal.</li>

      <li>You can scale a tree, pillar, or other vertical structure of roughly
      cylindrical shape as long as it is no more than 5 feet in diameter or less
      than 1 by coiling around it and slithering your way up. You have a climb
      speed equal to half your walking speed while doing this, and your hands
      remain free while you do so.</li>

      </ul>
