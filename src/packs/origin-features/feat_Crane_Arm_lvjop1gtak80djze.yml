      <p>You only have a single arm designed for a specialized use, including
      one extension. For holding, grasping, and using objects, you can use a
      bonus action to swap your extension out for an articulated hand. While not
      wielding a shield, you can use your arm to wield a weapon with properties
      that would normally require two hands (loading,&nbsp;two-handed) or if
      wielding a versatile&nbsp;weapon to be treated as wielding it
      two&nbsp;handed. Choose one of the following.</p>

      <p><em>Arc Welder Extension: </em>This extension functions as the shocking
      grasp cantrip (using your highest ability score as its
      spellcasting&nbsp;ability) but its effects are&nbsp;nonmagical.</p>

      <p><em>Flamethrower Extension: </em>This extension functions as the
      produce flame cantrip (using your highest ability score as its
      spellcasting&nbsp;ability) but its effects are&nbsp;nonmagical.</p>

      <p><em>Multi-Tool Extension: </em>You are proficient with and can deploy
      built-in navigator&rsquo;s tools, thieves&rsquo; tools, and tinker&rsquo;s
      tools with this&nbsp;extension.</p>
