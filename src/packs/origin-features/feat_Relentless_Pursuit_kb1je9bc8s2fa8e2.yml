      <p><strong><em>Relentless Pursuit</em></strong>. Work with your Narrator
      to select one creature involved in your Destiny (your object of revenge,
      subject of devotion, etc.). You can spend 1 minute focusing on that
      creature. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, you
      learn that. Otherwise, after focusing, you know the distance and direction
      to that creature.</p>
