      <p>You have the following traits:</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You
      have darkvision to 60 feet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Telepathy. </strong>You
      can speak telepathically to a creature within 30 feet of you that you can
      see. Though this grants the creature no ability to respond telepathically,
      they can understand you if you share a language. You can speak in this way
      to one creature at a time.</p>
