      <p><strong>Feast and Famine.</strong> You can go a&nbsp;number of days
      equal to your Constitution&nbsp;modifier without suffering any fatigue

      for as many days&nbsp;as you went without.</p>

      <p><strong>Radical Perseverance. </strong>You only die&nbsp;after failing
      4 death saving throws instead&nbsp;of 3.</p>
