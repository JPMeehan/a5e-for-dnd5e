      <p>You have developed a great deal of personal magnetism in the pursuit of
      your vision. If you or a friendly creature you can hear fails a Persuasion
      check, you can spend your inspiration to succeed instead. Note that this
      does not necessarily get you everything you wanted out of the conversation
      or negotiation, but does mean that the other creature is inclined to view
      you and your goals favorably.</p>
