      <p>Drawing upon great reservoirs of draconic power, you can unleash
      magical destruction upon your foes. You can use your dragon breath as an
      action.</p>

      <p>Choose the type of damage dealt by your breath weapon from the
      following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison,
      psychic, radiant, or thunder.</p>

      <p>Additionally, choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide or a
      15-foot cone for the area that your breath weapon affects. Each creature
      in the breath&rsquo;s area makes a Dexterity saving throw . If your breath
      weapon deals psychic damage, a Wisdom saving throw is made instead of
      Dexterity; if cold, necrotic, poison, radiant, or thunder, a Constitution
      saving throw . The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution
      modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>

      <p>A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw, and half damage
      on a success. The damage increases to 3d6 at 4th level, 4d6 at 9th level,
      5d6 at 14th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.</p>

      <p>After you use your dragon breath, you can&rsquo;t use it again until
      you finish a short or long rest</p>
