      <p>You know the shillelagh cantrip. You can stick your fist into the soil
      as an action, causing you to cast entangle without spending a spell slot
      and reducing your speed to 0 until the spell ends. You can do so once
      between long rests. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your
      choice of Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>
