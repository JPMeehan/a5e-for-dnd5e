      <p>You have the following traits:</p>

      <p><strong>Inexorable Concentration. </strong>When you fail a Constitution
      saving throw to maintain concentration, you can&nbsp;immediately reroll
      it, taking the new result.&nbsp;You may use this trait a number of
      times&nbsp;equal to your Intelligence modifier&nbsp;(minimum 1), and
      regain all expended&nbsp;uses after a long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Resident Expert.</strong> Choose two tools with which you are
      proficient, or a skill with which you are proficient from Animal Handling,
      Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. When
      you make a check with that tool or skill and the d20 shows a natural
      result of less than 10, you can count the d20 result<br>as being 10.</p>
