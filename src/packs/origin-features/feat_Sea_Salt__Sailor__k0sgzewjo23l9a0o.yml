      <p>Your nautical jargon and rolling gait mark you unmistakably as a
      mariner. You can easily enter into shop talk with any sailors that are not
      hostile to you, learning nautical gossip and shipsâ€™ comings and goings.
      You also recognize most large ships by sight and by name, and can make a
      History or Culture check to recall their most recent captain and
      allegiance.</p>
