      <p>Soldiers recognize their own. Off duty soldiers are usually willing to
      trade tales and gossip with you. On duty soldiers, while not obeying your
      orders, are likely to answer your questions and treat you respectfully on
      the off chance that youâ€™re an unfamiliar officer who can get them in
      trouble</p>
