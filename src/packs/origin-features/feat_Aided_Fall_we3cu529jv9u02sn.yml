      <p>Your wings also slow your fall. When you fall, unless you choose not
      to, your wings slow your fall to a speed of 150 feet per round; at this
      speed, you have resistance to damage from falling. You can slow your fall
      speed even further as a reaction, to a fall rate of 60 feet per round; at
      this speed, you take no damage from falling.</p>
