      <p>You have a bundle of forged papers of all kinds—property deeds,
      identification papers, love letters, arrest warrants, and letters of
      recommendation—all needing only a few signatures and flourishes to meet
      the current need. When you encounter a new document or letter, you can add
      a forged and modified copy to your bundle. If your bundle is lost, you can
      recreate it with a forgery kit and a day’s work.</p>
