      <p>Even when you cannot use your wings to fly, you can use them to aid you
      in your jumps. As long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, and
      are not encumbered (if using variant encumbrance), you may determine your
      jump distance with your Dexterity, your jumps count as having made a
      running start, and your jump distance is doubled.</p>
