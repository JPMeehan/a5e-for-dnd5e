      <p>&nbsp;Whenever you struggle to maintain the masquerade that you are who
      you say, a surprising number of people are willing to help you through
      your &ldquo;lapses of memory.&rdquo; They might be deluding themselves, or
      perhaps they know your secret but provide you cover for reasons of their
      own. So long as you don&rsquo;t act completely out of character or get
      caught in an outrageous lie, you can usually find someone willing to cover
      for you. This cover most commonly takes the form of excuses for your
      strange behavior.</p>
