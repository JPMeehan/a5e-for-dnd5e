      <p>You have journeyed beyond the veil of death and saw some unusual sights
      on your journey. Creatures of death or the afterlife such as Celestials,
      Fiends, and Undead can recognize this about you at a glance and will often
      be more forthcoming and candid with you than other mortals. If one would
      normally be hostile to you, there is also a 50% chance they will be
      indifferent instead. You do not gain this benefit with creatures you or
      your allies engage in combat.</p>
