      <p>Your care of sparse resources kicks in when plans go awry. When you are
      subject to Supply loss, you can declare any of the lost Supply as being
      your protected provisions, conserving it. Each week, you can declare a
      maximum number of protected provisions equal to your proficiency bonus +
      your choice of Intelligence or Wisdom modifier.</p>
