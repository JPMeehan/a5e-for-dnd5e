      <p>Stone speaks to you in a way that&rsquo;s hard to describe. You can
      repair stone weapons and armor by making a DC 15 mason&rsquo;s tools
      check. In addition, if you have an&nbsp;expertise die</span>&nbsp;on
      an&nbsp;<span>attack roll made using a stone weapon, you increase that die
      one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, and so on).</p>
