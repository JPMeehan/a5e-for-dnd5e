      <p>The whims of chaos flow through you and everything you do. Whenever you
      roll one or more dice to determine the damage of an attack or spell or the
      random effects of a spell or feature, you may choose to reroll those dice;
      if you do you must use the new rolls.</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain the Chaotic alignment and emit a strong chaotic
      aura for the purposes of any feature, spell, or trait that detects or
      affects Chaotic creatures.</p>
