      <p>Common amongst the chromatic dragons, this umbra burns with draconic
      power. Once on each of your turns while this umbra is active, you can deal
      extra damage of the type dealt by your Dragon Breath to one target when
      you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals
      half your level (minimum 1). If you are not dragonborn, you may choose the
      damage type dealt by your umbra from those available in the Dragon Breath
      trait.</p>
