      <p>Someone created you to be a zombie or flesh guardian&hellip; but you
      became something else entirely. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Size.</strong> Your height increases to 7 or 8 feet tall, and
      you weigh no less than 300 pounds. Your size is Medium, if it wasn&rsquo;t
      already.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Heavy Lifter.</strong> When determining your carrying capacity
      and the weight that you can push, drag, or lift, your size is considered
      to be Large.</p>

      <p><strong>Rotting Burst.</strong> You are rotten beneath the surface,
      with noxious puss aching to burst forth. You can use this trait when you
      take damage, requiring no action or reaction. Creatures within 5 feet take
      an amount of acid, necrotic, or poison damage (your choice) equal to your
      proficiency bonus. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again
      until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
