      <p>When you are in a settlement where you haven't made yourself unpopular,
      you can ply your trade at a local tavern or inn. As compensation you earn
      room and board (modest lifestyle) for yourself plus a number of creatures
      equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher, minimum of
      1). While plying your trade in this way, you can Gather Information
      simultaneously with no penalty.</p>
