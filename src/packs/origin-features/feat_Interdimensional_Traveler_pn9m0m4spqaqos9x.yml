      seas, contemplated cosmic mysteries, or fallen victim to alien corruption.
      You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Interdimensional Psionics. </strong>You know the mage
      handcantrip, and when you cast it the hand is invisible. Once you reach
      3rd level, once per long rest you can cast either jump or shield. At 5th
      level, once per long rest you can cast either detect thoughts or misty
      step. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your choice of
