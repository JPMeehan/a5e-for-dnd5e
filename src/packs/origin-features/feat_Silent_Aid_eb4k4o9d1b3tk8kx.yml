      <p>Being in tune with your spirit allows them to point out something you
      might have missed, if only for their own purposes. You gain a +2 to your
      choice of your passive Perception, Investigation, or Insight score,
      depending on your spirit&rsquo;s skills.</p><p>If you banish, free, or
      otherwise lose your spirit, consult with the Narrator to choose an
      appropriate feature from another background. Alternatively, the Narrator
      may rule that you&rsquo;ve become a beacon for the supernatural and
      another spirit has taken up haunting you.</p>
