      <p>You know the mage hand cantrip, and when you cast it the hand is
      invisible, replaced by a faint blue aura. You can use this trait once
      between long rests to cast one spell, chosen from charm person, mage
      armor, or arcane riposte dealing psychic damage. Your spellcasting ability
      for these is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>
