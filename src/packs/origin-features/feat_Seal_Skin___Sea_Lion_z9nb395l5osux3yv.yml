    value: >-
      <p>You were born with a magical seal skin that grows with you and which
      may be worn alongside other clothes and armor. As a bonus action while
      wearing the skin, you may shapeshift into either a seal or sea lion,
      chosen at character creation. You cannot later change your choice. In
      either case, your alternate form is referred to as your &ldquo;seal
      form.&rdquo; Your skin is specific to you and cannot be used by any other
      creature, even another selkie.</p>

      <p>While in seal form, you retain your hit points, as well as the
      Sea-Longings and Insulated features from the selkie base heritage.
      Likewise, you may still choose to use features that grant you an alternate
      AC (such as the berserker&rsquo;s
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.j2n9an7ozhbs1hlp]{Rugged
      Defense} feature) if they do not require armor. Any equipment you are
      wearing or wielding merges into your new form and has no effect until you
      leave the form.</p>

      <p>You may remain in your seal form indefinitely, including while
      unconscious. However, your transformation ends if you are reduced to 0 hit
      points or choose to end it as a bonus action. If you gain the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape}
      feature, this feature does not gain any of its benefits. If you lose your
      skin, you can create new skin for yourself using the
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.acw9pizt7nhzdwdl]{Regenerate}
      spell or by using magic of similar or greater power, subject to Narrator
      discretion.</p>
