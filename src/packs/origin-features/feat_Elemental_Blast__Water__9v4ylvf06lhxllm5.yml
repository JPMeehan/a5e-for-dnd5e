      <p>The most basic use of your elemental power is showcased&nbsp;by your
      ability to lash out with attacks of raw elemental&nbsp;energy. To use your
      elemental blast, as an action, make a&nbsp;ranged spell attack with a
      range of 60 feet. Your elemental&nbsp;blast deals damage equal to 1d6 +
      your spellcasting&nbsp;modifier, and the damage dealt is determined by the
      blast&nbsp;you used.</p><p>The elemental energy fades after the attack,
      but its effects&nbsp;are left behind (for instance, a fire blast could
      ignite&nbsp;flammable materials, and an earth blast or a water
      blast&nbsp;could smother or quench a fire, but an earth blast or
      water&nbsp;blast will not leave earth or water behind). Each
      elemental&nbsp;blast power has its own damage type, as seen below in
      table&nbsp;&ldquo;Basic Elemental Blasts&rdquo; and
      properties.&nbsp;</p><p>As you gain levels, the number of damage dice
      your&nbsp;Elemental Blast deals increases, as shown in the Blast
      Dice&nbsp;column on the Elementalist table. If you later gain a
      new&nbsp;Elemental Affinity, you gain access to that element&rsquo;s
      blast&nbsp;as well.</p>
