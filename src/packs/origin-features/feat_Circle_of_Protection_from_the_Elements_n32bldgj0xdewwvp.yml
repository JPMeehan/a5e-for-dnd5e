      <p>You are trained on magical protection from the elements, which you
      reinforce or alter through a simple ritual. When you complete a long rest,
      choose one damage type from the following: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
      thunder. You have resistance against that damage type until you use this
      trait to change damage types.</p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you can convey this damage
      resistance to a willing creature you touch. The damage resistance
      disappears from you, and lasts on the target creature for 1 hour. You
      regain the damage resistance at the end of your long
      rest.</span>&nbsp;</p>
