      <p>As a bonus action, or as a reaction immediately after taking damage,
      you can turn invisible. The invisibility lasts until the end of your next
      turn, and it ends early if you attack, deal damage, cast a spell, or force
      a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you must
      finish a short or long rest before doing so again.</p>
