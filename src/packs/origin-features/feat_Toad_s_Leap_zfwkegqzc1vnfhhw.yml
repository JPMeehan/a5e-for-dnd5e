      <p>When performing a Long Jump you can cover a number of feet equal to 3
      times your Strength score (although it is still limited by your movement
      speed). When performing a High Jump you can leap into the air a number of
      feet equal to 10 plus your Strength modifier. You are always considered to
      have made a running start, even when stationary.</p>
