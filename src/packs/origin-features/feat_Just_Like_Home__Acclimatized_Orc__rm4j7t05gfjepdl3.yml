      <p>Choose one type of terrain, reflecting the area from which your family
      hails: arctic, desert, mountain, or swamp. You ignore all naturally
      created difficult terrain of that type. Additionally, you gain an
      expertise die on Survival checks made within this terrain type, and gain a
      type of damage resistance related to your chosen terrain: arctic—cold,
      desert—fire, mountain—lightning, swamp—poison.</p>
