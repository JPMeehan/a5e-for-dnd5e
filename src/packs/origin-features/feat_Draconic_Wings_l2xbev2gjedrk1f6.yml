      <p>Some dragonborn are born with draconic wings.</p><p><strong>Flight.
      </strong>You have a fly speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you
      can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Whenever you spend 3 full
      consecutive rounds airborne without landing, you gain a level of fatigue.
      Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing a rest.</p>
