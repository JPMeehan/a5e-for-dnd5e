      <p>Any words you can understand, written or spoken, you can recall with
      precision. You automatically succeed on checks made to recall such
      information, unless magic interferes with you. You gain an expertise die
      on saves made against effects that harm your memory, as well as on checks
      made to reproduce written or spoken information you know (such as with
      transcription or forgery).</p>
