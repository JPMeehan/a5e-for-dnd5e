      <p>You occasionally hear a voice—perhaps your conscience, perhaps a higher
      power—which you have come to trust. It told you to go into seclusion, and
      then it advised you when to rejoin the world. You think it is leading you
      to your destiny (consult with your Narrator about this feature.)</p>
