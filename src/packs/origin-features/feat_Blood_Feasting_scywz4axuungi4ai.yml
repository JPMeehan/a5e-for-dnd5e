      <p>You’ve drank from the cup of the blood lords, but your powers are only
      just awakening. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong><em>Blood
      Feasting</em></strong>. As part of a short rest, you can sink your teeth
      into the corpse of a Humanoid which has died within the past hour and
      drain it of blood. At the end of that rest, you regain a number of hit
      dice equal to your proficiency modifier (never exceeding your hit dice
      maximum). A corpse can be used for this trait no more than once. Once you
      have used this trait to regain a number of hit dice equal to your
      character level, you can’t gain any more until you complete a long
      rest.</p>
