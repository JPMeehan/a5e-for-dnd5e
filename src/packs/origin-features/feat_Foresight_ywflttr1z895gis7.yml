      <p>You know in your very being that all things follow naturally from one
      another in a deterministic pattern, and that by planning in the present
      you secure the future.</p>

      <p><em>Make a plan that snatches victory from the jaws of defeat, make a
      fool of a foe by remaining one step ahead of them, supply your allies with
      vital information, sow false or deceptive information among your foes, lay
      the groundwork for something that won&rsquo;t pay off until potentially
      well after the end of your life.</em></p>
