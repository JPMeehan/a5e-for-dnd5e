      <p>When you fail a saving throw to resist fatigue you can use this trait
      to immediately reroll that save with advantage, possibly turning that
      failure into a success. Once you do so, you can&rsquo;t do so again until
      you complete a long rest.</p><p>Also, whenever you complete a long rest
      and recover from a level of fatigue, you can instead recover from two
      levels of fatigue.</p>
