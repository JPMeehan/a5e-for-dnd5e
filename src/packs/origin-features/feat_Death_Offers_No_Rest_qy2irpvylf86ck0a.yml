      <p>You are a restless corpse driven by revengeâ€”or some other matter for
      which you would give up eternity. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong><em>Death Offers No Rest</em></strong>. A year and
      one day after obtaining this gift, or once you complete your Destiny, you
      are doomed. Until then you gain the following
      benefits:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If you are below half your hit point maximum
      at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point. However, when you spend
      hit dice during a short rest, you only recover half as many hit points as
      normal.</p></li><li><p>If you die, you return to "life" 24 hours after
      death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of
      your death at a spot determined by the Narrator, possibly by
      requisitioning an unused corpse. If your equipment was also destroyed, you
      do not regain it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul>
