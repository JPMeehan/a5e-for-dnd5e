      intuitively identify the weight-bearing wall or pillars of a structure,
      dealing double damage against it with your next weapon attack.

      next action you or an ally take to repair it.</p><p>You always choose
      which ability score to use for rolls (Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma).</p>
