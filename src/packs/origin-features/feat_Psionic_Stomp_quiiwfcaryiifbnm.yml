      <p>Some half-giants have psionic gifts thanks to the undue influence of
      aberrations and maniacal mages. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Resist Psionics.</strong> You have resistance to psychic and
      force damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Shockwave. </strong>You can cast thunderwave once per long
      rest, dealing force damage instead of thunder damage. Your spellcasting
      ability for these spells is your choice of Constitution, Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>
