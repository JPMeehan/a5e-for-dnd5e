      <p>You have a burrowing speed of 10 feet. You can use your burrowing speed
      to move through nonmagical sand, loose earth, loamy soil, mud, or snow,
      but not solid rock. You do not naturally leave any sort of tunnel behind
      but you can attempt to create a 5-foot by 5-foot wide tunnel in earth,
      soil, or snow by spending extra time and effort shoring it up and adding
      support. This reduces your burrowing speed to 5 feet every 15 minutes.</p>
