      <p>Airborne fishers like pteranodon and quezaquatalus. You have an aura
      that allows you to glide. When you fall, if you arenâ€™t incapacitated, you
      can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend. You are
      immune to falling damage as long as you aren't incapacitated.</p>
