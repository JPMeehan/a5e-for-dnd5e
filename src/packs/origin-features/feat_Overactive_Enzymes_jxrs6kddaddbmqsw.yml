      <p class="Indent1">You can release a splash of digestive enzymes to harm
      your foes. You gain the<em>&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">acid
      splash</span>&nbsp;</em>cantrip, which you can cast without requiring
      components. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip is your choice of
      Charisma, Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom.</p>

      <p class="Indent1">You can also use your digestive enzymes to dig. You
      have a burrowing speed of 10 feet and can move through nonmagical earth
      and stone, but not solid rock. You don&rsquo;t leave a tunnel behind
      unless you spend time and effort to shore up the tunnel, reducing your
      burrow speed to 5 feet every 15 minutes.</p>
