      <p>You can release a splash of digestive enzymes to harm your foes. You
      gain the<em>
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.spells.Item.z3y2a7pwy9gzcv45]{Acid Splash}
      </em>cantrip, which you can cast without requiring components. Your
      spellcasting ability for this cantrip is your choice of Charisma,
      Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom.</p>

      <p>You can also use your digestive enzymes to dig. You have a burrowing
      speed of 10 feet and can move through nonmagical earth and stone, but not
      solid rock. You don&rsquo;t leave a tunnel behind unless you spend time
      and effort to shore up the tunnel, reducing your burrow speed to 5 feet
      every 15 minutes.</p>
