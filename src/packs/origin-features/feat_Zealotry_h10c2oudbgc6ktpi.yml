      <p>You are careful to conspicuously demonstrate absolute dedication to
      your ideology. If you fail an ability check or saving throw, you can
      choose to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can
      see within 30 feet of you (maximum +3), possibly changing a failure into a
      success. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish
      a short or long rest.</p>
