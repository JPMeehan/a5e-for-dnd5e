      <p>While in a settlement in which you can establish a connection with the
      government, you can ply your trade as a civil servant (such as
      campaigning, performing inspections, meetings with important people, or
      doing office work) to earn yourself an income granting you a rich
      lifestyle. While plying your trade in this way, you can Gather Information
      simultaneously at no penalty.</p><p>Alternatively, when you Gather
      Information while not plying your trade in this way, you gain advantage on
      Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation checks to draw closer to a
      political faction or movement.</p>
