    value: >-
      <p>Choose either&nbsp;scars or scourge, and then choose one of&nbsp;the
      following damage types: acid, cold,&nbsp;fire, force, lightning, necrotic,
      poison,&nbsp;psychic, radiant, or thunder.</p>

      <p><em>Scars: </em>You have resistance to the&nbsp;chosen damage type.</p>

      <p><em>Scourge: </em>As a bonus action, you can&nbsp;enhance the next
      attack you make this&nbsp;turn. If that attack hits, it deals
      extra&nbsp;damage of the chosen type equal to&nbsp;your proficiency bonus.
      However, the&nbsp;sting of the scourge lessens after the&nbsp;initial
      strike, so after you deal this extra&nbsp;damage to a creature, this trait
      cannot&nbsp;deal extra damage to it during the same&nbsp;combat</p>
