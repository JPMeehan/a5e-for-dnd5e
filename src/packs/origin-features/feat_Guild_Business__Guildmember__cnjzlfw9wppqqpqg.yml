      <p>While in a city or town, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle by
      plying your trade. Furthermore, the guild occasionally informs you of jobs
      that need doing. Completing such a job might require performing a downtime
      activity, or it might require a full adventure. The guild provides a
      modest reward if youâ€™re successful.</p>
