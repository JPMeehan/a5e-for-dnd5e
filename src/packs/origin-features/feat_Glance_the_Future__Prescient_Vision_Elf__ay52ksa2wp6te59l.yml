      <p>Your eyes can see a few moments into the future, and your mind
      apprehends the divergent possibilities. Once between rests you can use a
      bonus action to roll a d20 and record the result. Before the end of your
      next short or long rest , when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes
      an ability check , attack roll, or saving throw , you can use your
      reaction to replace their roll with your recorded result. When the
      creature is also rolling an expertise die , only the d20 roll is replaced.
      When the creature is rolling more than one d20, such as when it has
      advantage or when a halfling is using their Lucky trait, the replacement
      applies to the creatureâ€™s final roll.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you
      cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
