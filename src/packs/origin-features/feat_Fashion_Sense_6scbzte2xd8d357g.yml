      <p>You know how to read people through their clothes and bearing. After
      you spend at least 1 minute observing a creature within 60 feet, you can
      use an action to make either an Insight or History check against a DC
      equal to the creature’s passive Deception check score. On a success, you
      learn the following information about that creature:</p><ul><li><p>Whether
      the creature has a lower Charisma score than yourself. </p></li><li><p>The
      creature’s culture and national origin (if any). </p></li><li><p>The
      creature’s social standing in the local majority culture.</p></li></ul>
