      <p>You have done so much in the service of preservation that you yourself
      are preserved, becoming ageless. Your effective physical age becomes early
      middle age (the equivalent of 35 for a human) or if you are already older
      when you achieve this feature you slowly de-age to that level of physical
      ability. You may still retain some gray hair or wrinkles (player&rsquo;s
      discretion) to mark your wisdom and experience. You no longer age (and
      cannot die of old age or have your effective age altered by magic), are
      resistant to poison and necrotic damage, have advantage on saves against
      poison, and are immune to disease. In addition, if you were already
      resistant to poison or necrotic damage, you become immune to that type of
      damage instead.</p>
