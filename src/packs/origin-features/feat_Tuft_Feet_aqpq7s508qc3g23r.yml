      <p>You have the following traits:</p><p><strong>Big Feet. </strong>You
      gain an expertise die on&nbsp;checks and saving throws made to
      resist&nbsp;being knocked prone.</p><p><strong>Thick Soles. </strong>You
      are immune to&nbsp;damage from sharp terrain hazards (such&nbsp;as
      caltrops, broken glass, or the spike&nbsp;growth spell) and ignore
      difficult terrain&nbsp;caused by them. Additionally, other kinds&nbsp;of
      difficult terrain reduce your movement&nbsp;speed by 5 feet instead of
      halving it.</p>
