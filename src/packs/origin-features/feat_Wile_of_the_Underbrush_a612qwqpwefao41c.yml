      <p>You are a new growth or a shrub, blessed with the agility and
      craftiness of a wild child. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Forest's Boon.</strong> You know the druidcraft cantrip. Your
      spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>

      <p><strong>Bouyancy.</strong> If you are not encumbered, you do not sink
      in water&mdash;you float. You can also walk across water for a limited
      distance, falling into the water after a number of feet equal to your
      Dexterity score.</p>

      <p><strong>Sapling Lash.</strong> As part of an attack when you are
      unarmed, you can turn one or both of your hands into a whip or a loaded
      sling. You can turn them back instantly at any time.</p>
