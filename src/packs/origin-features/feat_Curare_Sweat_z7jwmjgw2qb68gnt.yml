      <p>Your body is covered in a toxic film called curare sweat, which is a
      contact poison functioning much like ordinary curare poison. You can use
      it in one of several ways, and once you do you cannot use your curare
      sweat again until you complete a short or long rest. You can use your
      curare sweat to do one of the following:</p><ul><li><p>As a bonus action,
      you can coat one weapon or piece of ammunition with your curare sweat. The
      first creature struck by the coated weapon is subject to your curare
      sweat.</p></li><li><p>When a creature touches you against your will, and
      the member touching you is not protected by clothing or armor, you can use
      your reaction to subject the creature to your curare
      sweat.</p></li><li><p>At the start of your turn, if you are grappling or
      are grappled by a creature and you are physically touching<strong>
      </strong>them, you can subject them to your curare
      sweat.</p></li></ul><p>A creature subject to your curare sweat makes a
      Constitution saving throw against your curare sweat save DC or else it
      becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. The save DC for your
      curare sweat is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier,
      or 13, whichever is higher.</p><p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>Use Coat
      Weapon or Ammunition when the Curare Sweat is applied to the weapon or
      ammunition and then Attack with Coated Weapon when you make an attack with
      the previously Coated weapon or ammunition. Make sure to turn off the
      Weapon Coated effect after the first successful attack.</p>
