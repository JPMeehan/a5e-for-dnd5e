      <p>You gain a grade 5&nbsp;stronghold&nbsp;(at no cost, but which you are
      unable to sell) connected to the lasting change you want to make in the
      world, such as a castle, guildhouse, laboratory, or workshop. Work with
      the narrator to establish the location and particulars of this stronghold.
      Your passion has also inspired others. You gain one additional
      free&nbsp;follower&nbsp;(see Stronghold Types in Chapter 4: Equipment of
      Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide) for every 5 class levels you have. These
      followers are dedicated to your cause, and if they leave your service or
      die, you can replace them for no cost upon returning to your stronghold.
      You cannot act with impunity, however, and treating these followers poorly
      will have an impact on your cause and reputation.</p>
