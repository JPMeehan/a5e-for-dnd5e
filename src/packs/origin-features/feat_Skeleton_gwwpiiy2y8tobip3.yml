      <p>Your flesh is long passed into dust, and your joints creak with the
      grinding of dry bones. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Fleshless. </strong>You have resistance to nonmagical piercing
      damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Void of Entrails.</strong> You do not need to eat, drink, or
      breathe.</p>

      <p><strong>Unresting Sentinel.</strong> Instead of sleeping, during a long
      rest you sit or stand motionless. You remain conscious during this
      time.</p>
