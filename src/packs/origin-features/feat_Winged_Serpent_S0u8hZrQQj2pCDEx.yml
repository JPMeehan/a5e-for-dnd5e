      <p>Some sinuous take strongly after their couatl progenitors and grow
      feathered wings. These sinuous are more likely than most to have colorful
      scales and feathers on other parts of their bodies such as a feathered
      crest on their heads or shoulders. You have the following trait:</p>

      <p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> You have a fly speed of 30 feet. To
      use this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Whenever
      you spend 3 full consecutive rounds airborne without landing, you gain a
      level of fatigue. Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing
      a short or long rest.</p>
