      <p>Life along the crossroads rarely offers an opportunity for proper
      schooling, but the roads carry with them legends and stories from far and
      wide. You may always choose to use Wisdom when making History, Nature, or
      Religion checks. However, the Narrator may decide that the results of a
      check made in this way are distorted or exaggerated forms of the
      truth.</p>
