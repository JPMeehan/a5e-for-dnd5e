      <p>You are careful not to show weakness in front of others for fear of
      losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check,
      you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see
      within 30 feet of you (maximum +3), possibly changing a failure into a
      success. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish
      a short or long rest.</p>
