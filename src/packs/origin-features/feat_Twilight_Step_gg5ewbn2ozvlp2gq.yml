    value: >-
      <p>You have learned how to skip out of the Material Plane, fly through the
      Plane of Faerie, and land back in your native realm. You can forego your
      movement on your turn to teleport 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can
      see. Once you have used this trait, you cannot do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.&nbsp;</p>
