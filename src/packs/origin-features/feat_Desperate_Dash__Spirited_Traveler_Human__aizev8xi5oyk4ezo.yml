      <p>When you take the Dash action, your movement this turn does not provoke
      opportunity attacks. During this movement, you gain an expertise die on
      Athletics checks made to jump, and Dexterity saving throws. Once you use
      this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest.</p>
