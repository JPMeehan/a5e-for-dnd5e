      <p>You&rsquo;ve spent so much time underground that you have a natural
      feel for it. You always have a sense of how deep you are and which
      direction is north, provided that you&rsquo;ve traveled in these regions
      before. You are also generally aware of the physical and political
      geography of the region (e.g., &ldquo;the old dwarf colony is this way and
      those tunnels are part of the wererat pack&rsquo;s hunting
      grounds&rdquo;). You know where relatively safe places to camp are located
      and you can usually find fresh sources of water.</p>
