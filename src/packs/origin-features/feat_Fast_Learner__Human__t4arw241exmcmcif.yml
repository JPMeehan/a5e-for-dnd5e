      <p>With their shorter life spans, humans can acquire knowledge at a higher
      rate than more long-lived heritages (although not all acquire the wisdom
      to use it). You gain proficiency in one additional skill of your choice.
      In addition, you require half as much time as normal to train yourself in
      the use of a suit of armor, tool, or weapon during downtime.</p>
