      <p>Your magic is that of people who prefer to remain unseen&mdash;perhaps
      a gift passed to you by a gnomish ancestor. You gain the following
      benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Into Mist. </strong>As a bonus action, or as a reaction
      immediately after taking damage, you can turn invisible. The invisibility
      lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you attack,
      deal damage, cast a spell, or force a creature to make a saving throw.
      Once you use this trait, you must finish a short or long rest before doing
      so again.</p>
