    value: >-
      <p>Your time spent in the war horde trained you in the ways of warfare,
      particularly when youâ€™re ill-equipped. You are proficient with two martial
      weapons of your choice and with light armor. You are also able to cobble
      together functional if somewhat ramshackle weapons from whatever you have
      on hand. You can create a ramshackle version of any simple weapon (except
      crossbows) with 10 minutes of work if you have access to simple materials
      such as common household items, the rusted scraps found among
      battlefields, or the bounty of the forest. Ramshackle weapons created in
      this way function identically to their normal counterparts, except their
      gold value is always 0 and they break and become useless on a critical
      fumble.</p>
