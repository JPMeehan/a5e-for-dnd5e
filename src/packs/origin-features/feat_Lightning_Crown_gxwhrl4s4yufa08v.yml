      <p>In your flesh is whispered the secrets of fulgurian sovereignty. You
      gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Resist Electricity. </strong>You have resistance to
      lightning&nbsp;damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Lightning Reflection. </strong>If you would be dealt lightning
      damage, you can use your reaction to deflect it to a creature you can see
      within 30 feet (Dexterity save halves). The DC for this trait is 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + your choice of Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma modifier. If the target is the one who dealt you lightning
      damage, they automatically fail their saving throw.</p>

      <p>Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      complete a short or long rest.</p>
