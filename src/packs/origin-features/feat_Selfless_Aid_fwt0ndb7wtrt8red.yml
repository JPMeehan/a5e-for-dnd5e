    value: >-
      <p>Your aid is a lifeline and a steadying source of
      resolve.</p><p>Whenever you take the Help action to aid an ally attacking
      a creature, you may spend your inspiration. If you do, in addition to the
      normal benefits of the Help action, that creature has disadvantage on
      attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
