      <p>It has become apparent that wronging you is decidedly unwise and those
      without a death wish instinctively fear you. While you are not
      incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to direct a threatening stare at
      any hostile creature within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a
      Wisdom&nbsp;saving throw</span> with a DC equal to your passive
      Intimidation score. On a failure, the creature is
      <span>frightened&nbsp;until the end of its next turn. A creature that
      succeeds on its saving throw is immune to your Retaliatory Reputation for
      the next 24 hours.</p>
