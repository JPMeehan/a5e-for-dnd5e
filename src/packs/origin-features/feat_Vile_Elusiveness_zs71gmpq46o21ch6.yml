      <p>The extraplanar forces of darkness recognize you as one of their own
      and will aid you in your misdeeds. You may spend inspiration to gain
      advantage on all checks made to evade the consequences of your actions for
      an hour. For example, you may gain advantage on an Acrobatics or Athletics
      check to evade pursuing authorities, a Deception check to convince someone
      that you were not involved (or pin your misdeeds on someone else), an
      Investigation check to clean up evidence, and so on.</p>
