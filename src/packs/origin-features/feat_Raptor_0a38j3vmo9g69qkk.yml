      <p>Swooping is bad; for your victims. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Divebomb.</strong> You can use this trait while flying to use
      the Charge combat maneuver, without expending exertion. After you make
      your attack, you can continue flying whatever distance remains from the
      maneuver distance and your flight speed. This movement does not provoke
      opportunity attacks from the creature you divebomb. Once you use this
      trait, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long
      rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Eye in the Sky.</strong> You are proficient with Perception,
      and you gain the farsight specialty.</p>
