      <p>You can use an action to emit a captivating song. Enemy creatures who
      can hear you within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + either your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      modifier) or become charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or an ally
      deal damage to it. Creatures charmed in this way spend their movement to
      draw closer to you. Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected
      again by it for 24 hours. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it
      again until you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Foundry Note: Will
      automatically use the highest ability score modifier possible for the Save
      DC, change if desired.</strong></p>
