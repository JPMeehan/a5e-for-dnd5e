      <p>You are trained to detect even the most subtle indications of a
      personâ€™s religious perspective. After you speak with a person for at least
      1 minute, you can use an action to make either an Insight or Religion
      check opposed by their Deception check. On a success, you learn the
      following information about them:</p><ul><li><p>Whether they have a lower
      Wisdom score than yourself.</p></li><li><p>Whether they are religious; if
      so, you also learn their faith.</p></li><li><p>Whether they have class
      levels in the cleric or herald class.</p></li></ul>
