      <p>You are so hot-blooded, weapons literally catch fire in your&nbsp;
      hands. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Resist Fire. </strong>You have resistance to fire
      damage.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Scorching Attack. </strong>As a bonus action, you can boost
      your damage this turn with the power of fire. Creatures you deal damage to
      this turn take additional fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
      However, the sting of your temper lessens after the first blow, so after
      you deal this extra damage to a creature, this trait cannot deal extra
      damage to it during the same combat</p>
