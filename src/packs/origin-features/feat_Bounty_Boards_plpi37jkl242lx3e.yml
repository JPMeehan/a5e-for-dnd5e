      <p>You know the common procedures for finding information on wanted
      people. When you are in a community such as a settlement or a district of
      a large city, you can spend 1 hour gathering leads on bounties. You learn
      about one of the following: a villainous threat to this community, a
      wanted small-time criminal, the identity of a local crime group, a noble
      looking for “a trustworthy employee,” or a commoner wronged by any of
      these. You can express which you prefer, but the information you find is
      determined by the Narrator. Whatever person or group you learn about, you
      get a lead on their location and some assurance of payment for your
      work.</p>
