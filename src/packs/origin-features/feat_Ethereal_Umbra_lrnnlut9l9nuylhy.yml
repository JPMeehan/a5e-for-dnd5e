      <p>Common amongst the essence dragons, this umbra shimmers with draconic
      will. While this umbra is active you can move through nonmagical solid
      objects and occupied spaces as if they were difficult terrain. Opportunity
      attacks made against you while this umbra is active have disadvantage. You
      cannot move further than 5 feet into walls or other solid objects in this
      way. If you would end your turn in an occupied space, you are shunted into
      the nearest unoccupied space and take [[/r 1d6 #force damage]] force
      damage.&nbsp;</p>
