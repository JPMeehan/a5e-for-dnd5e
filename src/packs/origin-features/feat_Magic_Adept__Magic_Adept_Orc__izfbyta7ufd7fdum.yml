      <p>You are born with magic coursing through your veins, and are able to
      utilize it in a number of ways. You learn one cantrip of your choice from
      the wizard spell list. At 3rd level, choose one 1st- or 2nd-level spell
      from the wizard spell list. You can cast the chosen spell without any
      material components once per long rest. A 1st-level spell chosen this way
      can be cast at 2nd-level using this trait, if the spell allows. Your
      spellcasting ability for this trait is the same as the ability score used
      in the spellcasting class in which you have the highest level, or Charisma
      if you have no levels in a spellcasting class.</p>
