      <p>Elves with the gift of Prescient Vision have&nbsp;the following
      trait:&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Glance the Future.</strong> Your eyes can see a few moments
      into the future, and your mind apprehends the divergent possibilities.
      Once between rests you can use a bonus action to roll a d20 and record the
      result. Before the end of your next rest, when a creature you can see
      within 60 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you
      can use your reaction to replace their roll with your recorded result.
      When the creature is also&nbsp;rolling an expertise die, only the d20 roll
      is&nbsp;replaced. When the creature is rolling&nbsp;more than one d20,
      such as when it has&nbsp;advantage or when a halfling is using&nbsp;their
      Halfling&rsquo;s Luck trait, the replacement&nbsp;applies to the
      creature&rsquo;s final roll.</p>
