      <p>Certain types of healing are less effective or even wholly ineffective.
      Sources of nonmagical healing&nbsp;other than taking a rest have no
      effect.&nbsp;Magical healing only restores half as&nbsp;many hit points as
      normal unless you are&nbsp;also repaired in the same round (with
      an&nbsp;Engineering check, the mending cantrip,&nbsp;or similar).</p><p>In
      addition, you don&rsquo;t require Supply&nbsp;in the typical sense;
      instead of eating&nbsp;food, you rely on a specific substance
      to&nbsp;refuel. Every 24 hours without the&nbsp;substance you suffer a
      level of fatigue and&nbsp;strife as your inner machinations begin
      to&nbsp;decay.</p><p>Select one of the
      following.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><em>Sunlight: </em>3 hours of full sunlight or
      6 hours of partial (shaded or cloudy) sunlight.</li></ul>
