      <p>Your vigilance and commitment to preservation can make a huge
      difference in moments when it counts, albeit at the cost of your own
      safety. When a friendly creature or precious object within 15 feet of you
      would be harmed by an attack or some detrimental effect, you can spend
      your inspiration (no action required) to cause that attack or effect to
      target you instead.</p>
