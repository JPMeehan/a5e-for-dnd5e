      <p>As a bonus action, you can boost your damage this turn with the power
      of fire. Creatures you deal damage to this turn take additional fire
      damage equal to your proficiency bonus. However, the sting of your temper
      lessens after the first blow, so after you deal this extra damage to a
      creature, this trait cannot deal extra damage to it during the same
      combat.</p>
