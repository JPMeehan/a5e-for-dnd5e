      <p>Undaunted by momentary setbacks, you twist conversations in any
      direction with an inspired turn of phrase and confusing doubletalk that
      plays off bold lies and impertinent proposals as jokes, obfuscates or
      redirects accidentally slipped information, or quells outrage with
      diffusing flattery.</p><p>Whenever you or a friendly creature you can hear
      fails a Deception or a Persuasion check, you can use your reaction to
      spend your inspiration and undo any consequences of that failed check.</p>
