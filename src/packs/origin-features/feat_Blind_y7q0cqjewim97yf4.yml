      <p>You are permanently&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">blind</span>
      and can&rsquo;t see beyond the range of your blindsight. You can&rsquo;t
      benefit from any ability or magical effect that would grant you visual
      sight or darkvision. Your inability to see, however, is not without its
      advantages. You are immune to any illusion spell that relies on vision,
      such as blur<em>&nbsp;</em>, darkness, or invisibility<em>&nbsp;</em>, and
      you are also immune to attacks and effects that require meeting a
      creature&rsquo;s eyes, such as a&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">medusa&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;petrifying gaze.
      Additionally, you gain an&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">expertise
      die</span> on Perception checks that don&rsquo;t rely on sight.</p>
