      <p>As an action, you can push your allies to get that extra edge you need
      to survive. You and friendly creatures who can see and hear you within 30
      feet may spend hit dice, rolling them and gaining temporary hit points
      instead of healing. A creature can spend a number of their hit dice in
      this way up to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t
      use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
