      <p>The depths always call to you, no matter where you go. You always know
      the distance and direction of the nearest sea, and you can never become
      lost by non-magical means while at sea. At the Narrator&rsquo;s
      discretion, this feature may also apply to similar bodies of water, such
      as large lakes or underground oceans.</p>
