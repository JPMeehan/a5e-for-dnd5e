      <p>Whenever you fail at a Deception or Persuasion check, your curse
      manifests in a manner that you work out with your Narrator ahead of time.
      The failed check is ignored, and you immediately roll an Intimidation
      check with which you have expertise, taking the new roll. However, even a
      successful Intimidation check does not necessarily produce the result you
      originally intended, as the creatures around you may recoil in fear and
      distrust. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may keep the expertise
      die to Intimidation until the end of the scene.</p>
