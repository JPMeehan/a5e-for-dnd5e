      <p><strong>Battle Readiness. </strong>Your Speed&nbsp;increases to 30 feet
      and you are proficient&nbsp;with clubs, spears, and light
      crossbows.&nbsp;In addition, you have a melee weapon&nbsp;built into one
      of your arms that is&nbsp;immediately swapped out for a hand
      when&nbsp;sheathed. Choose one melee weapon that&nbsp;does not have the
      heavy, two-handed, or&nbsp;versatile property. When attached in
      this&nbsp;way, you are proficient with the weapon, it&nbsp;cannot be
      thrown, and you cannot be&nbsp;disarmed of it. The weapon can
      be&nbsp;replaced with another weapon with 10&nbsp;minutes of work and a DC
      13 Engineering&nbsp;or tinker&rsquo;s tools check.</p>
