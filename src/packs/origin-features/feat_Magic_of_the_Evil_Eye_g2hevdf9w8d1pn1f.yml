      <p>You know the chill touch cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can
      cast bane once per long rest. At 5th level, you can cast mental grip once
      per long rest. You donâ€™t need material components for these spells, and
      your spellcasting ability for them is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      (whichever is highest).</p>
