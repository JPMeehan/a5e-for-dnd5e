      <p>You can create whatever gear you might need to survive in the wilds.
      You can create a ramshackle version of any survival gear (except for maps
      and rations) with 10 minutes of work if you have access to simple
      materials such as common household items, battlefield scraps, or the
      bounty of the forest. Ramshackle survival gear created in this way
      functions identically to their normal counterparts, except their gold
      value is always 0 and they break and become useless after 12 hours.</p>
