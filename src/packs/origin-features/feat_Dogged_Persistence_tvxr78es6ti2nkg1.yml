      <p>Those who give up rarely change the world. You may spend inspiration to
      do one of the following (no action required):</p><ul><li><p>Minimize the
      damage you take from a single attack or other source (such as a fall,
      spell, or environmental effect) this turn.</p></li><li><p>Treat a long
      rest you take outside of a haven as if it had been taken inside a haven.
      </p></li><li><p>Reroll an unsuccessful ability check, taking the new roll
      if it is better.</p></li><li><p>Restore a spent hit die.</p></li></ul>
