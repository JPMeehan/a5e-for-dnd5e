    value: >-
      <p>Thanks to your experience supervising children, you have a knack for
      keeping track of your companions. As long as an ally is within 60 feet of
      you, you always know their general location even if you cannot see or
      otherwise sense them. This effect is blocked by 1 foot of lead or iron and
      magical effects like the nondetection spell.</p>
