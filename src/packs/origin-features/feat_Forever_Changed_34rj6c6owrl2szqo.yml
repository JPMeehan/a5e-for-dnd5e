      <p>You have finally reached the apex and have become something greater
      than your previous self could imagine. When you gain this feature, consult
      with the Narrator about the exact nature of your metamorphosis and if your
      adventurer would still choose to remain adventuring after
      transformation.</p>

      <p>If your character would remain an adventurer, you may choose and become
      an appropriate creature with a CR equal to or lower than your class level
      &ndash;2 (as per the spell <em>true polymorph</em>, except that this
      transformation is permanent and cannot be dispelled.)</p>

      <p>If your character would not remain an adventurer, you may use a portion
      of your new power however you see fit (as the <em>wish&nbsp;</em>spell)
      before ascending.</p>
