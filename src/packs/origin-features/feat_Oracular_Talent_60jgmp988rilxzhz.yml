      <p>You know one divination cantrip or 1st-level divination spell of your
      choice. If you choose a 1st-level spell, you can cast it once without
      spending a spell slot or providing material components, and must finish a
      long rest before you can do so again. Your spellcasting ability for this
      spell is Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is highest).</p>
