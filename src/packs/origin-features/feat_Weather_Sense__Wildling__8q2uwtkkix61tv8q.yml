      <p>Pick a terrain type. After observing the area for 1 minute, you can
      predict the weather in this terrain within the next 24 hours. You cannot
      foresee magical changes, but you can use an action to make an Insight or
      Perception check to notice them. When you have successfully predicted the
      weather, you gain an expertise die on saving throws made against its
      effects.</p>
