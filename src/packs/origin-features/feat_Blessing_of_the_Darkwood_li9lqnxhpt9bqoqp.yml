    value: >-
      <p>You are an elder tree, an old-growth from the densest quadrant of the
      woods. Faeries whisper their secrets to you, indeed you may have been
      there when the fairy tales first occurred. You gain the following
      benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to the darkest regions of the
      forest realms, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
      can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
      in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in
      darkness, only shades of gray.</p>

      <p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You gain an expertise die on saving
      throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p>

      <p><strong>Druidic Elder.</strong> As one of the oldest trees in the wood,
      you are well acquainted with the druidic ways. You know the Druidic
      language and the grapevine cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for this
      spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>
