      <p>Citizens at the heart of a nation often see more healers and clerics in
      a year than a remote villager sees in a lifetime, and your medical upkeep
      has made you resilient. Whenever your hit point maximum or one of your
      ability scores would be reduced, it is reduced by half as much instead
      (minimum 1).&nbsp;</p>
