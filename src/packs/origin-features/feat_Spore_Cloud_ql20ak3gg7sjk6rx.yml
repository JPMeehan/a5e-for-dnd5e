      <p class="Indent1">Mycelials naturally produce poisonous spores, which
      they can use to attack or defend themselves.</p>

      <p class="Indent1">You can use a bonus action to release a puff of
      poisonous spores in a 5-foot-radius area centered on you. The spores
      lightly obscure the area and linger in air or water for 1 minute or until
      dispersed by a strong wind or current. Non-plant creatures that enter the
      area for the first time on a turn or start their turn there must make a
      Constitution&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">saving
      throw</span>&nbsp;. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 poison damage and
      is&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">poisoned</span>&nbsp;until the end
      of its next turn. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Constitution modifier. The poison damage increases to 2d6 at
      4th level, 3d6 at 9th level, 4d6 at 14th level, and 5d6 at 19th level.</p>

      <p class="Indent1">Once a creature has been affected by the spores, it is
      immune to this effect for 24 hours. You can use this trait a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain any expended uses when
      you finish a&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">long rest</span> .</p>
