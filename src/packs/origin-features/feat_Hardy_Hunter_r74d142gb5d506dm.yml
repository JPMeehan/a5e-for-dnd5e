      <p>You have sharp teeth and tough scales&hellip; Even if it doesn&rsquo;t
      quite look that way. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Scales.</strong> You have tough interlocked fishy scales. While
      you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity
      modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>

      <p><strong>Shark Teeth.</strong> Your bite is a natural weapon, which you
      can use to make unarmed strikes that deal equal to 1d6 piercing damage.
      Attack and damage rolls with your bite use your choice of Strength or
      Constitution modifiers.</p>

      <p><strong>Feeding Frenzy.</strong> You can use this trait as a bonus
      action to make a bite attack. If you hit, you regain hit points equal to
      your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). Once you use this trait, you
      can&rsquo;t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
