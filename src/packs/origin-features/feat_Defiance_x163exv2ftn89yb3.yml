      <p>You draw inspiration from striking out against oppression, defying long
      odds, and placing hope in the impossible. You gain inspiration whenever
      you score a critical hit against a creature larger than you are, roll a
      natural 20 on a death saving throw, openly defy a powerful being, or
      succeed after taking a risk with long odds.</p><p>Loudly refuse the orders
      of a tyrant, follow through with a convoluted or risky plan, succeed at
      something you were extremely likely to fail.</p>
