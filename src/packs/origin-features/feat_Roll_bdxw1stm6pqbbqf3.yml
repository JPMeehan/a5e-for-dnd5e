      <p>You can use a bonus action to curl into a boulder, or an action to
      uncurl. While in boulder form your Speed is reduced to 0, and you cannot
      use a shield, make attacks, use your arms, or cast spells with seen
      components.</p><p>While in boulder form you can use an action to roll
      yourself in a straight line up to 30 feet, or 60 feet down a decline.
      While rolling you can attempt to enter the spaces of creatures up to one
      size larger than you, forcing each to make a Dexterity&nbsp;saving throw
      against your maneuver DC. On a failure, a creature or object takes
      bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. If a creature
      succeeds on its saving throw, you do not enter its space and your movement
      stops.</p>
