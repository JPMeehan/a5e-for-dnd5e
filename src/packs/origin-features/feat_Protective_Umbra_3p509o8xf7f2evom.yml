      <p>Common amongst the metallic dragons, this umbra sparks with draconic
      ingenuity. While this umbra is active you gain&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">resistance</span>&nbsp;to the damage type dealt
      by your Dragon Breath (if you already had resistance to that damage type,
      you gain&nbsp;<span
      class="freelinking-link">immunity</span>&nbsp;instead), and you gain
      an&nbsp;<span class="freelinking-link">expertise die</span>&nbsp;on Wisdom
      or Intelligence checks. If you are not dragonborn, you may choose the
      damage type for your umbra from those available in the Dragon Breath
      trait.</p>
