      <p>Universal forces are often inclined to restore those who die heroically
      for noble causes, blessing their sacrifice by making them better than they
      were before. As long as you have not died of old age, 24 hours after you
      die (or in 24 hours, if your death triggered gaining this feature) you
      miraculously revive intact with full hit points. You appear after
      &ldquo;narrowly surviving&rdquo; the circumstances that killed
      you&mdash;climbing out of the chasm you fell down, crawling from the
      rubble of the structure that collapsed over you, waking up from impossibly
      lethal wounds that prove superficial, or magically transporting from the
      plane of existence you were caught in.&nbsp;In addition, the first time
      you are revived in this way, you gain a +1 bonus on all future attack
      rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
