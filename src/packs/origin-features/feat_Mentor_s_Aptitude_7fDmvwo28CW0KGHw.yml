      <p>You gain an expertise die with one of the skills or tools you gained
      from this background. When a friendly creature within 60 feet of you fails
      a check using the chosen skill or tool while making a check that requires
      more than an action to complete, you can use a reaction to grant that
      creature a reroll. The creature must use the new roll, even if it is
      worse.</p>
