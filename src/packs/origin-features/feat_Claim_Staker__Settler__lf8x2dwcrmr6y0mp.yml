    value: >-
      <p>A tall fence and the grit to defend it is often all it takes to stake a
      claim out on the frontier. Whenever you begin a long rest, you can choose
      to spend the first hour of that rest making the area into a fortified
      position for the duration. While resting in a fortified position, the
      ground in a 60-foot radius area around you is considered difficult terrain
      for any creatures other than those you consider allies. In addition, the
      first time a hidden creature enters the fortified area, it must make a
      Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency
      bonus). On a failed save, the creature inadvertently makes loud noises and
      is no longer hidden.</p>
