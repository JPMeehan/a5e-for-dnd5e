      <p>Your heinous misdeeds sow terror and corruption wherever you go. You
      may, once per hour and with a touch, do any of the
      following:</p><ul><li>Poison a well, wither 10,000 square feet of crops,
      or spoil all of the stored food and drink in a 1000-cubic foot space.
      Creatures consuming the poisoned fare receive no benefit from it and take
      1d6 poison damage per portion they consume. Creatures who eat the food
      also suffer the poisoned condition for 8 hours.</li><li>Permanently
      afflict a creature with a CR equal to or less than 1/10th of your
      character level with a debilitating condition such as chronic pain or
      cancer. You can choose whether the condition will kill the creature over
      the course of 1-2 years or consign it to a lifetime of
      suffering.</li><li>Permanently erase a random pleasant memory from a
      creature&rsquo;s mind. The creature is aware of the loss.</li><li>Cause a
      creature&rsquo;s loved ones to stop trusting it for a week.</li><li>Learn
      the worst thing a creature with a CR up to 1/5th of your level has ever
      done.</li></ul><p>You may delay the onset of any of the above effects for
      up to a week in order to conceal your role.</p><p>In addition, you gain
      the Evil alignment trait, and you emit a strong evil aura for the purposes
      of any feature, spell, or trait that detects or affects Evil
      creatures.</p>
