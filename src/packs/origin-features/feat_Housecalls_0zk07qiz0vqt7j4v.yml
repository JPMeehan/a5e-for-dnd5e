      <p>When you wear the uniform of your office (such as a doctor’s jacket,
      medic insignia, or a witch’s hat), people familiar with your medical
      tradition recognize you as a member on sight, oftentimes making requests
      for your healing expertise. Strangers who trust your medical tradition and
      receive your care will support you with a modest lifestyle.</p>
