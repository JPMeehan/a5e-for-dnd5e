      <p>You know the Charge maneuver. Once between short or long rests, you can
      use this trait to Charge without spending exertion. Whenever you use
      Charge, you can opt to jump the distance you would travel instead of
      walking, even if it is longer than your maximum long-jump distance.</p>
