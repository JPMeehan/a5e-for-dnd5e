      <p>All frogfolk communicate through use of croaks and gurgles from their
      throat pouch, but your croaks boom like thunder and resonate deep within
      the body of your foes, causing them to shudder with nearly supernatural
      fear. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Terrifying Croak. </strong>You can use an action to emit a loud
      and horrifying croak. Enemy creatures within 30 feet who can hear you must
      make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + either your
      Constitution or Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you for 1
      minute. Creatures with a CR at least 3 higher than your level have
      advantage on this saving throw, and creatures with a CR at least 3 lower
      than your level have disadvantage. Creatures that succeed at this save
      cannot be affected again by it for 24 hours. Once you use this trait, you
      can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p id="foundryNote"><strong>Foundry Note:</strong> Ability defaults to
      highest ability score for DC calculation, if you want to change it make
      sure to do so!</p>
