    value: >-
      <p>You can use an action to emit a loud and horrifying croak. Enemy
      creatures within 30 feet who can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw
      (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + either your Constitution or Charisma
      modifier) or become frightened of you for 1 minute. Creatures with a CR at
      least 3 higher than your level have advantage on this saving throw, and
      creatures with a CR at least 3 lower than your level have disadvantage.
      Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by it for 24
      hours. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Foundry Note: </em></strong><em>Ability defaults to highest
      ability score for DC calculation, if you want to change it make sure to do
      so!</em></p>
