      <p>Your internal fires grant you superior vision in dark and dim
      conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
      bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t
      discern color in darkness, all things are tinged shades of red.</p>
