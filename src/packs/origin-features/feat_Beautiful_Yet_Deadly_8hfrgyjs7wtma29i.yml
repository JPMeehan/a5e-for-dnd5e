      <p>Your body is adorned with beautiful colors, an indication of the toxin
      you emit. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Poison Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to poison
      damage and advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition.</p>

      <p><strong>Curare Sweat.</strong> Your body is covered in a toxic film
      called curare sweat, which is a contact poison functioning much like
      ordinary curare poison. You can use it in one of several ways, and once
      you do you cannot use your curare sweat again until you complete a short
      or long rest. You can use your curare sweat to do one of the
      following:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>As a bonus action, you can coat one weapon or piece of ammunition with
      your curare sweat. The first creature struck by the coated weapon is
      subject to your curare sweat.</li>

      <li>When a creature touches you against your will, and the member touching
      you is not protected by clothing or armor, you can use your reaction to
      subject the creature to your curare sweat.</li>

      <li>At the start of your turn, if you are grappling or are grappled by a
      creature and you are physically touching them, you can subject them to
      your curare sweat.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A creature subject to your curare sweat makes a Constitution saving
      throw against your curare sweat save DC or else it becomes stunned until
      the end of its next turn. The save DC for your curare sweat is 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier, or 13, whichever is
      higher.</p>
