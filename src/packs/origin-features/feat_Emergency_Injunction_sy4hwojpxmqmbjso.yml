      <p>While in a settlement in which you can communicate with officers of the
      law, you can spend 1 hour to file an emergency injunction. This injunction
      compels a specific person to complete or cease a certain action in
      consistency with the law—such as “stay away from my horse” or “get your
      horses out of my stable.” The injunction is a legal order which will be
      enforced by the town guard, and it is considered law for one week after
      which time the emergency injunction wares out and it must be restored
      through the normal bureaucratic means.</p><p>Alternatively, you might
      instead file paperwork formally accusing a person of a crime or granting
      someone you know bail without payment. You can file no more than 1
      emergency injunction per week.</p>
