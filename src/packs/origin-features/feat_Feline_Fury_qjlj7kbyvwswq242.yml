      <p>Whether backed into a corner or toying with a wounded foe, never forget
      that cats aren&rsquo;t truly tame. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Feline Fury.</strong> When you or your intended target are
      bloodied, your melee weapon attacks deal bonus damage equal to your
      proficiency bonus. However, the sting of your fury lessens after the first
      blow, so after you deal this extra damage to a creature, this trait cannot
      deal extra damage to it during the same combat.</p>
