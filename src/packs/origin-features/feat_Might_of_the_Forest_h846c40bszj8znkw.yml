      <p>You are as mighty as the locust and the redwood, able to wallop your
      foes with your branches and capture them with your roots. You gain the
      following benefits:+</p>

      <p><strong>Fists of the Forest. </strong>As part of an attack when you are
      unarmed, you can turn one or both of your hands into a club, greatclub, or
      quarterstaff. You can turn them back instantly at any time.</p>

      <p><strong>Entangling Grasp. </strong>You know the shillelagh cantrip. You
      can stick your fist into the soil as an action, causing you to cast
      entangle without spending a spell slot and reducing your speed to 0 until
      the spell ends. You can do so once between long rests. Your spellcasting
      ability for these spells is your choice of Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
      or Charisma.</p>
