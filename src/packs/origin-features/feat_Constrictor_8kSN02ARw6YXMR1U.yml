      <p>Some sinuous have exceptionally muscular tails and heavy, armored
      scales. They tend to also have muscular torsos and scales on their upper
      bodies. You have the following traits:</p>

      <p><em><strong>Scales.</strong></em> You have tough, plate-like scales.
      While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity
      modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Constrict.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on
      checks to initiate or maintain a grapple on creatures of Medium size or
      smaller, which can be coiled around as part of the grapple. Once per turn
      as a bonus action, you can squeeze a grappled creature in your coils,
      dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 2d4 + your Strength modifier. In
      addition, your hands remain free when you are grappling another creature.
      You cannot use your climb speed from Sinuous Physiology while using this
      trait. You cannot coil around creatures of Large or larger size.</p>
