      <p>If you listen closely enough, you&rsquo;ll get eaten. You gain the
      following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Birdsong.</strong> You gain proficiency with Performance.</p>

      <p><strong>Captivating Song.</strong> You can use an action to emit a
      captivating song. Enemy creatures who can hear you within 30 feet must
      make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + either your
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier) or become charmed by you for 1
      minute, or until you or an ally deal damage to it. Creatures charmed in
      this way spend their movement to draw closer to you. Creatures that
      succeed at this save cannot be affected again by it for 24 hours. Once you
      use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
