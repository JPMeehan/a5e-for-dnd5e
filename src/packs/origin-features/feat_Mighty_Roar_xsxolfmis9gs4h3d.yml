      <p>Channeling your strength and pride, you can drive away enemies with a
      mighty roar. You gain the following benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Mighty Roar.</strong> You can unleash your mighty roar as a
      bonus action. Enemy creatures who can hear you within 10 feet must make a
      Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + either your
      Constitution or Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you for 1
      minute. Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by it
      for 24 hours. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until
      you finish a short or long rest.</p>
