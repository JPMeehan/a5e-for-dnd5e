      <p>Strong leadership has been an important survival tactic among your
      people for generations. Some say the gift of leadership is self-taught;
      others say it is a gift from the gods. You gain the following
      benefits:</p>

      <p><strong>Fight for Your Lives! </strong>As an action, you can push your
      allies to get that extra edge you need to survive. You and friendly
      creatures who can see and hear you within 30 feet may spend hit dice,
      rolling them and gaining temporary hit points instead of healing. A
      creature can spend a number of their hit dice in this way up to your
      proficiency bonus. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again
      until you complete a long rest.</p>

      <p><strong>Just Swing It! </strong>When you obtain this trait, choose one
      martial weapon. You and friendly creatures you can see and who can see you
      within 30 feet are proficient with this weapon and with shields.</p>
