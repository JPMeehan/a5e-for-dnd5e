      <p>&nbsp;You can speak Common and Undercommon and you can
      read&nbsp;Grimlock texture writing, which uses the&nbsp;words and grammar
      of Undercommon.&nbsp;Because most grimlocks lack traditional&nbsp;sight,
      blind members of their society are&nbsp;not taught the written or signed
      forms of&nbsp;the languages they use to communicate.&nbsp;Grimlocks with
      darkvision learn the written&nbsp;and signed forms of Common
      and&nbsp;Undercommon normally.</p>
