    value: >-
      <p>If you would be dealt lightning damage, you can use your reaction to
      deflect it to a creature you can see within 30 feet (Dexterity save
      halves). The DC for this trait is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your
      choice of Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier. If the
      target is the one who dealt you lightning damage, they automatically fail
      their saving throw. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again
      until you complete a short or long rest.</p><p><strong>Foundry Note: Will
      automatically use the highest ability score modifier for the Save DC,
      change if desired.</strong></p>
