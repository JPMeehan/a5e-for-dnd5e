      <p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
      light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern
      color in darkness, only shades of gray. In addition, your eyes are
      perfectly adapted for spotting movement at depth, and the radius of your
      darkvision increases to 120 feet while underwater.</p>
