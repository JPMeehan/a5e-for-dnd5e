      <p>You can use this trait while flying to use the Charge combat maneuver,
      without expending exertion. After you make your attack, you can continue
      flying whatever distance remains from the maneuver distance and your
      flight speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the
      creature you divebomb. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again
      until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
