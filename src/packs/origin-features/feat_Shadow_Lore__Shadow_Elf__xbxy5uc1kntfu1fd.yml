      <p>You know a cantrip: either dancing lights or minor illusion. Once you
      reach 3rd level, you can cast faerie fire once per long rest. At 5th
      level, you can cast darkness once per long rest. You donâ€™t need material
      components for these spells, and when casting them your spellcasting
      ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).</p>
