      <p>You can designate one willing mount to be bonded with your spirit,
      which lasts until you or that creature dies, or until you designate a
      different one as part of a long rest. While riding on your bonded mount,
      if it is untrained you can still control it as if it were trained. If this
      creature is a dinosaur, it gains spell resistance (advantage on saving
      throws against spells).</p>
