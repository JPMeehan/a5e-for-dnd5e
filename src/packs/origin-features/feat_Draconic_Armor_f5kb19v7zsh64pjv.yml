      <p>You have the following traits:</p>

      <p><strong>Claws.&nbsp;</strong>You grow retractable claws from&nbsp;the
      tips of your fingers. Extending or&nbsp;retracting the claws requires no
      action.</p>

      <p>The claws are natural weapons, which&nbsp;you can use to make unarmed
      strikes that&nbsp;deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your&nbsp;Strength
      modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Resistance. </strong>You have resistance to the&nbsp;damage
      type dealt by your Dragon&nbsp;Breath.</p>

      <p><strong>Scales. </strong>You have tough interlocked draconic scales.
      While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor or your only armor is a shield, your
      AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier</p>
