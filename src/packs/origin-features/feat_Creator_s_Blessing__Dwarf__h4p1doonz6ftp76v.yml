      <p>You were born with the gift of creation. You gain proficiency with one
      set of artisans’ tools (either brewer’s supplies, mason’s tools) or
      smith’s tools. During a long rest, you can use these tools for crafting
      instead of sleeping and still receive the full benefits of the long
      rest.</p>
