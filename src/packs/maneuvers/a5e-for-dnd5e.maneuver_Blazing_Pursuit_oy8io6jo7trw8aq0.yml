    value: >-
      <p>With fiery heat, you pursue a fleeing foe.</p><p>If a creature moves
      out of your reach, you may expend your reaction to move in the same
      direction up to 20 feet and make a single melee attack against the
      creature if they are within your reach. This movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity, and your weapon attacks deal fire damage, as well
      as its original types, until the end of your next turn.</p>
