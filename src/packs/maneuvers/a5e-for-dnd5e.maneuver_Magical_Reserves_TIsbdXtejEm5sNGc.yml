      <p>You draw upon the strength of your resolve to replenish your magical
      reserves, albeit at a cost.</p><p>You may restore spell slots by spending
      exertion at a rate of 3 exertion points per spell-level of the slot. For
      example, if you wished to restore a 2nd-level spell slot this way, you
      would need to expend 6 exertion points. Alternatively, you can restore
      spell points, spending 3 exertion points per 2 spell points. You may
      restore any number of spell slots and spell points this way, provided you
      have the exertion to pay for them.</p><p>The strain of this process takes
      a metaphysical toll. You take 1 point of damage per 3 exertion points
      spent on this maneuver. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any
      way.</p>
