      <p>You use a melee weapon to strike a foe from a distance.</p><p>Choose a
      weapon when you learn this combat maneuver. You can use the chosen weapon
      to strike a distant target with air pressure, giving your attack a normal
      range of 20 feet and long range of 60 feet. This functions as if your
      weapon had the thrown property except you don't actually throw
      it.</p><p>You have advantage on attack rolls made using this maneuver. If
      both attack rolls hit, you deal an additional weapon damage
      die.</p><p>After using this maneuver to hit a creature, it can use an
      action to make a Perception check against your maneuver DC. On a success,
      for the next minute any uses of Wind Strike do not grant advantage on
      attack rolls made against the creature.</p>
