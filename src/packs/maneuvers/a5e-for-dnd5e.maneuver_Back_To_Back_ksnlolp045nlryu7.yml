      <p>You know how to fight while surrounded by foes and can quickly instruct
      an ally on how to move in concert to survive against an overwhelming
      number of foes.</p><p>Choose an ally within 5 feet. Until the start of
      your next turn, as long as that ally remains within 5 feet of you and is
      able to take actions, and both of you are unmounted, you and your ally
      increase your AC by 2.</p><p>In addition, each of you gets an extra
      reaction that can be used before the start of your next turn to either
      make an opportunity attack or activate a combat maneuver.</p>
