    value: >-
      If you have Extra Attack, you may use this maneuver in place of one
      attack. You command your animal companion to move up to its base movement
      speed in a straight line toward a creature. If your animal companion ends
      this movement within melee range, it makes one attack against that
      creature. Your animal companion cannot take the Dash action and this
      maneuver on the same turn.
