      <p>You command your animal companion to make a Knockdown maneuver against
      a creature within its reach. If you are also within melee reach of the
      creature, choose one of the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The maneuver DC for the attack is increased by 1d4</li>

      <li>Your animal companion may use Knockdown on a creature one size
