      <p>On your animal companion&rsquo;s turn, it makes a melee attack against
      a creature as it roars, howls, or makes some similar threatening noise.
      All hostile creatures within 30 feet of your animal companion must make a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they have disadvantage to attack any
      creature that is not your animal companion until the start of your animal
      companion&rsquo;s next turn.</p>
