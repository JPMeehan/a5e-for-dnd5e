      <p>You draw up the dead to do your horrible bidding. Choose a number of
      squares equal to your Charisma modifier within 30 feet. These squares
      become occupied with shadowy apparitions, which have an AC equal to 10 +
      your Charisma modifier your Maneuver DC and 10 hit points. Each apparition
      has its own reaction for the purpose of making opportunity attacks , which
      it makes using your attack bonus, but cannot help flank. On a hit, the
      creature takes damage equal to your Charisma modifier and you gain hit
      points equal to the damage dealt. You can also use your own reaction to
      direct an apparition to make another opportunity attack if it has already
      used its own.</p><p>While maintaining this stance, you can forgo your
      movement to instead move any apparition the same number of squares. This
      can be split among multiple apparitions, as long as you have the movement
      available. The apparitions must stay within 30 feet of you or they vanish.
      This stance ends early if all apparitions are destroyed.</p>
