      <p>The extremely rapid delivery of food can be not only hilariously
      satisfying, but also give a warrior an edge in combat.</p>

      <p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the <span
      class="freelinking-link">Attack action and make a weapon attack</span>, as
      well as any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack. This weapon attack
      must target a creature and be made using an improvised weapon that
      includes food or is made out of <span
      class="freelinking-link">Supply</span> (such as a pie, bowl of stew,
      flagon of mead, or other container filled with nourishment). On a hit, the
      creature is <span class="freelinking-link">blinded</span> until either the
      start of its next turn or until it uses its reaction to wipe its eyes
      clean (whichever is first). Until the creature uses a bonus action to
      entirely clean its face, you gain an <span
      class="freelinking-link">expertise die</span> on Intimidation checks made
      against the creature.</p>
