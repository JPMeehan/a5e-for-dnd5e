    value: >-
      <p>With careful judgments of distances, materials, wind, and applied force
      you let loose a shot that bounces off of one or more surfaces to strike
      opponents crouching behind walls or otherwise hidden from sight by
      cover.</p>

      <p>On the next ranged weapon attack you make before the start of your
      turn, you can completely ignore a target's cover.</p>

      <p>Only targets that have total cover from being entirely enclosed by an
      object or effect (such as inside of a chamber with no openings to shoot
      through or a sphere from wall of force) have cover against this attack,
      and you do not have disadvantage from attacking a target you cannot
      see.</p>
