      <p>You and your animal companion must both take this stance to gain its
      benefits. When you make a melee attack against a creature, your animal
      companion gains advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the
      start of your next turn.</p><p>In addition, your animal companion has
      advantage on saving throws and it takes half as much damage as normal.</p>
