      <p>Watching a companion under attack infuriates you and you fling yourself
      at their opponent with a powerful shove.</p><p>After a creature within
      your reach makes a melee attack against an ally, you can use your reaction
      to make an Athletics check against the creature's maneuver DC. On a
      success you shove the creature 10 feet away from you and you move 10 feet
      in that direction.</p><p>This movement does not provoke opportunity
      attacks.</p>
