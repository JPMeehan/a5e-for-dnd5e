      <p>Swinging or thrusting with your weapon like you have thousands of times
      before, you know precisely where its tip grazes and your swing hits at the
      smallest flaw in an opponent's armor to deliver a painful
      wound.</p><p>Choose a weapon when you learn this combat maneuver. If you
      hit with your next attack roll using the chosen weapon against a living
      creature, you deliver a wound that deals 1d4 ongoing damage (page
      448).</p><p>At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it makes
      a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p><p>Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5
      feet of it, can use an action to make a Medicine check against your
      maneuver DC, ending the ongoing damage on a success.</p><p>Healing
      magically or from a trait (such as Regeneration) also ends the effect.</p>
