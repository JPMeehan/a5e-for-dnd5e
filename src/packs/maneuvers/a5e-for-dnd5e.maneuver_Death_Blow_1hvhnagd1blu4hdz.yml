      <p>All your training culminates in this lethal attack. You deliver the
      perfect killing blow with a single secret technique.</p><p>Make a melee
      weapon attack against a creature. On a hit, your attack becomes a critical
      hit, and if your attack would have already been a critical hit the
      creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is
      reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
