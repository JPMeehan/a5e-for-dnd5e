    value: >-
      <p>A victorious battle cry strikes fear in the heart of your
      foes.</p><p>Make a melee weapon attack against a creature. On a hit, you
      release a mighty roar that shakes the very earth and firmament in a
      30-foot cube centered on you. Each hostile creature in the area makes a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes psychic damage equal
      to twice your proficiency bonus and it becomes frightened until the end of
      its next turn, or on a success it takes half damage and does not become
      frightened.</p>
