      <p>You snatch your enemy's weapon and use it against them.</p>

      <p>When a creature misses you with a melee weapon attack against you using
      a weapon, you can use your reaction to flip it out of the creature's
      hands. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, and on a failure it
      drops the weapon and you grab it from mid-air.</p>

      <p>You can spend 2 exertion points to immediately use the weapon to make a
      melee weapon attack against the creature.</p>
