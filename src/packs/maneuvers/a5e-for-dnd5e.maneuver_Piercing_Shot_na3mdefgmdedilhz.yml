    value: >-
      <p>With a flash of force pressing it onward, your attack drives through
      your target, and several others. When you use this maneuver your next
      ranged weapon attack becomes a line effect. Forgoing multiple attacks, you
      instead make an attack roll against each creature in a 50ft line of your
      choosing. This line begins at the edge or corner of your space.</p>
