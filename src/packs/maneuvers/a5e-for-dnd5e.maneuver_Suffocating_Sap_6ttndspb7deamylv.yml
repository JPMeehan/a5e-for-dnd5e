      bag</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within 15 feet
      with the tanglefoot bag, expending it. On a hit, the contents cover the
      creature&rsquo;s head. The target is blinded and cannot breathe while its
      head is covered this way, and must either make a Strength save as an
      action against your maneuver DC or an allied creature can make a Medicine
      check as an action with the same DC to free its head from the sap. A
      creature that doesn&rsquo;t need to breathe is still blinded. The sap can
      also be removed by damaging it as per the normal use of a tanglefoot
      bag.</p>
