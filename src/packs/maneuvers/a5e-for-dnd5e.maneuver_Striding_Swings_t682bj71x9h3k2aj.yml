      <p>With supreme confidence you march forward with your attack, stepping
      heavily into every strike and driving each blow home.</p><p>When you
      activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action and make a weapon
      attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack. Move up
      to 15 feet. This movement can be through the space of hostile creatures
      that are up to one size category larger than you, and the spaces of other
      creatures do not count as difficult terrain.</p>
