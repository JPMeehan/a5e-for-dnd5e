      <p>Even as you strike your foe your ally never leaves the periphery of
      your vision, that your vigilance does not end. Choose one target within
      your weapon&rsquo;s normal range. If a creature moves into a space
      adjacent to the target, you may make a special ranged opportunity attack
      against the approaching creature as a reaction.</p>
