      </strong><em>a silver object no smaller than a coin, a weapon with a metal
      striking surface, a spell of the transmutation school prepared, and either
      an unused first-level or higher spell slot or 2 or more spell points or
      artifact charges</em></p>

      <p dir="ltr">You quickly plate the weapon with silver and take the Attack
      action with it (including any additional attacks from the Extra Attack or
      similar features). It counts as a silvered weapon for this Attack action
      and until the beginning of your next turn, at which point the silver
      flakes off and is lost. While the weapon is silvered this way, creatures
      with damage immunity or resistance that can be bypassed by silver take an
      additional d6 points of radiant damage from attacks made with it.</p>
