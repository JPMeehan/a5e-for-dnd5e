      <p>An expert parry turns a hit into a miss.</p><p>When a creature hits you
      with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to evade the attack. The
      creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, and on a failure its attack
      becomes a miss. A creature that scored a critical hit has advantage on its
      save.</p>
