      <p>With expert timing you apply just the right amount of force to send an
      opponent's weapon flying just as they strike.</p><p>When a creature makes
      a melee weapon attack against you and misses, you can use your reaction to
      force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a weapon it is
      wielding (your choice) flies from its grip to land in a randomly
      determined space 10 feet away.</p>
