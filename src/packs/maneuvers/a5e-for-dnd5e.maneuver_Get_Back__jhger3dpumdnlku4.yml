    value: >-
      <p>When a creature successfully damages your animal companion, you order
      it to retreat. As long as it can hear you, your companion moves up to its
      Speed toward you in the most direct course it is able to, stopping at the
      end of its movement or when you are between it and the creature that
      injured it (whichever comes first). It can also choose to move up to twice
      its Speed, taking a level of fatigue in the process. This movement does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures your animal companion
      can see.</p>
