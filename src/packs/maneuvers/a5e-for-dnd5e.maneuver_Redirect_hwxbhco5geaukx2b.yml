    value: >-
      <p>Your opponent's blow is not simply turned away but re-oriented
      entirely, forced into inflicting a wound against a foe unfortunate enough
      to be nearby.</p><p>When you are hit with a melee weapon attack, you can
      use your reaction to force the attacker to make an Intelligence saving
      throw. On a failure, you take no damage and the attack targets another
      creature within 5 feet.</p><p>A Huge-sized or larger attacker has
      advantage on the saving throw. Once you have used this maneuver against a
      creature, until the end of combat it has advantage on saving throws to
      resist Redirect.</p>
