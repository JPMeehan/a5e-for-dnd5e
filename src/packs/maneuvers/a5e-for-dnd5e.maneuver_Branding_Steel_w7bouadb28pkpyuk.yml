      <p>You permanently mark your foe with your sword.</p><p>Before the start
      of your next turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack you
      can choose to brand it. A branded creature has disadvantage on
      concentration checks and on attacks made against creatures other than you.
      In addition, a branded creature able to see you cannot move closer to you
      without making a Wisdom saving throw. The brand on a creature is removed
      when it regains 30 hit points or more from a healing spell or similar
      magic.</p>
