      <p>You charge a spellcaster in order to interrupt their spell.</p><p>When
      a creature you can see casts a spell, you can use your reaction to move up
      to your Speed. If you end your movement adjacent to that creature, you can
      make a melee weapon attack against it. On a critical hit, the spell is
      interrupted (expending the spell slot) and has no effect.</p>
