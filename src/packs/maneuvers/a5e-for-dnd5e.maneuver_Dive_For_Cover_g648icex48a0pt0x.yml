      <p>Under fire, you dive for cover.</p><p>When you are targeted by a ranged
      attack, after it hits or misses you, you can use your reaction to move up
      to your Speed.</p><p>If your movement ends adjacent to either a solid
      barrier as big as you are or a creature the same size as you or larger,
      until the beginning of your next turn you have three-quarters cover
      against ranged attacks (+5 bonus to AC and saving throws) as long as you
      remain adjacent to the barrier or creature.</p>
