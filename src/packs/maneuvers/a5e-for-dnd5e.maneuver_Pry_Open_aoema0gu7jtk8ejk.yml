      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirements:</strong> A hand free, a crowbar</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Make a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet
      of you that is wearing armor. On a hit, you wedge the crowbar into the
      joints of the armor and pry, snapping straps, distorting plates, and
      otherwise leaving your target exposed. Your target takes 1d4 points of
      bludgeoning damage and suffers a -2 penalty to their AC until they spend a
      minute fixing their armor. A creature can only suffer from one instance of
      the AC reduction of this ability at a time.</p>
