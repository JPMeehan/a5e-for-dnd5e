      <p>If you are within 20 feet when your animal companion is hit by an
      attack, you can use your reaction to call out and help it regain its
      fighting spirit. As long as it is able to hear you, your animal companion
      regains hit points equal to your level.</p><p>If your animal companion
      benefits from this feature and is charmed, poisoned, or restrained, it can
      use its action on its next turn to end those conditions.</p>
