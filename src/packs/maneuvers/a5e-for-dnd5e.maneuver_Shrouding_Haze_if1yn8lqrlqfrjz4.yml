      Expend a smoke bomb and a dose of basic poison to create a toxic cloud
      that heavily obscures your space and other spaces within 5 feet and
      lightly obscures spaces within 10 feet. A creature  that enters the cloud
      or starts its turn in the cloud must make a Constitution saving throw or
      become immediately confused and continue to be confused for one minute
      after it leaves the cloud. An affected creature can repeat the save at the
      end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The cloud
      dissipates after one minute or if dispersed by a strong wind such as that
      produced by the gust of wind spell. You are immune to your own Shrouding
      Haze.</p>
