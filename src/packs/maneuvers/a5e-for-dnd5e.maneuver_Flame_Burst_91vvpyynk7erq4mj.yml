    value: >-
      <p>With a broad slash of your weapon you conjure forth flames that flicker
      threateningly.</p><p>After dealing damage with a melee weapon, select
      three squares within your reach. These squares erupt into flames 5 feet
      high and count as difficult terrain and until the end of your next turn.
      Creatures that start their turn within the flames take fire damage as
      though hit by your weapon, as does any creature that attempts to move
      through the flames.</p>
