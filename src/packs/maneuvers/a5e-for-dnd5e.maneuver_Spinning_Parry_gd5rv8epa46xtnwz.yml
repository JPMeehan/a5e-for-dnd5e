      <p>A quick step and suddenly you and your foe exchange places.</p><p>You
      can use your reaction to make a Sleight of Hand check when a creature
      makes a melee attack against you, turning it into a miss if your result is
      higher than the attack roll.</p><p>In addition, you may also swap places
      with the attacker (no opportunity attacks provoked), forcing it to make a
      Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the beginning of its next
      turn.</p>
