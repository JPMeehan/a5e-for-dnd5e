    value: >-
      <p>Playing dead, you surprise your foe with a sudden attack.</p><p>When
      you lose hit points, you can use your reaction to fall prone and pretend
      to be dead. All hostile creatures able to see you consider you to be dead
      or dying.</p><p>If a creature moves within your reach before the beginning
      of your next turn, you can immediately stand up and spend exertion to use
      a Tooth and Claw maneuver you know against it. No action is required to
      activate the maneuver and any melee attacks made as part of the maneuver
      have advantage.</p><p>After you have used Wounded Animal Gambit against a
      creature, if you activate it again before the end of combat it receives a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it realizes you are playing dead.</p>
