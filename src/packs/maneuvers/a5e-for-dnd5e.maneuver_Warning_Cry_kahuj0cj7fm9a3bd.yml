    value: >-
      <p>When a creature makes a weapon attack against your animal companion,
      your warning causes your companion to shift position, gaining a bonus to
      AC equal to your proficiency bonus and possibly turning a hit into a
      miss.</p>

      <p>Your animal companion cannot benefit from this maneuver and Vigilant
      Stance at the same time. Instead it gains the higher bonus of the two
      against the triggering attack, after which it benefits from Vigilant
      Stance as normal.</p>
