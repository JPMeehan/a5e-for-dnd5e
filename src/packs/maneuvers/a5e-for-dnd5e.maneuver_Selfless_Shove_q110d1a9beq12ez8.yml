    value: >-
      <p>As a reaction to an ally within 5 feet of you and no more than one size
      larger than you being forced to make a saving throw against a harmful
      effect that targets an area, you may enter your ally&rsquo;s space and
      shove them in any direction away from you a number of feet equal to 10 + 5
      for every point of exertion spent on this maneuver, potentially removing
      them from the area of effect but subjecting you to it. This movement does
      not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
