      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirement: </strong><em>a silvered or magic
      weapon</em></p>

      <p dir="ltr">You attack a target that can shapeshift, attempting to force
      it back into its true form. You take the Attack action, including any
      additional attacks granted by Extra Attack or similar features and must
      target a single creature with all of your attacks. For each attack that
      hits, the target must make a save against your maneuver DC or be forced
      into its true form. This spell also ends spells such as polymorph or class
      features such as Wild Shape that cause a creature to change its shape. If
      the target is already in its true form, it takes damage as normal, but
      suffers no additional effects. If a creature fails its save and you still
      have attacks remaining, you likewise make them as normal.</p>
