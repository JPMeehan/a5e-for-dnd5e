      <p>As you rush toward your goal you split into two, each racing forward.
      When you take this movement action, choose two squares to end your
      movement in. One of these squares is occupied by an illusion until the end
      of your next turn and the next attack roll made against you is at
      disadvantage. If you spend your action to dash while under this effect,
      your false-self also dashes, and you may make a single ranged weapon
      attack at any point during your dash action. If your false self is
      attacked, it has your AC and 1hp.</p>
