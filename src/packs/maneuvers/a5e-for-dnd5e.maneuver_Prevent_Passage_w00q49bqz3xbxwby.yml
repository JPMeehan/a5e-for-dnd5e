      <p dir="ltr">Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on saving
      throws to resist falling prone or being moved against your will, and other
      creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to move through your
      space.&nbsp;</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, until the start of your next turn, your reach
      extends by 10 feet for the purposes of enemy creatures triggering
      opportunity attacks, and creatures provoke attacks of opportunity when
      they enter your threatened area. If you make an opportunity attack against
      a creature beyond your weapon&rsquo;s normal reach, you may move up to 10
      feet as part of your reaction to bring the creature within your
      weapon&rsquo;s range. On a hit, the creature&rsquo;s movement speed is
      reduced to 0.</p>
