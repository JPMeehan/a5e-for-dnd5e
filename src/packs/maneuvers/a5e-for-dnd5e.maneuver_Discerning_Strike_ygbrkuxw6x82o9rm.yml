      <p> A probing blow allows you to take the measure of your foe.</p><p>When
      you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action and make a weapon
      attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack. Until
      the start of your next turn, when you deal damage to a creature you learn
      its current hit points, hit point maximum, immunities, resistances, and
      vulnerabilities.</p><p>If you score a critical hit you can choose one of
      the creature's resistances or immunities. The creature loses that
      resistance or immunity until the end of your next turn. In addition, until
      the beginning of your next turn you gain advantage on melee weapon attacks
      against that creature.</p>
