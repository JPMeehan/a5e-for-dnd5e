      <p><span class="fontstyle0">At the sight of incoming danger, you briefly
      call up a warding shield around yourself and nearby allies.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">When you or an ally within 15 feet are
      targeted by a spell with a duration of 1 round or less, you may briefly
      manifest a 5-foot-square shield centered in front of the target. The
      creature gains threequarters cover against the spell, potentially turning
      a hit into a miss. You may also spend up to a total of 3 exertion on this
      reaction, protecting one extra creature within range for each additional
      point spent.</span></p>
