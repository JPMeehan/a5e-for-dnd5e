      <p>You can use the Grapple maneuver to grab or wrestle a creature. If you
      are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver
      replaces one of them.</p><p>You must have at least one free hand to
      attempt a grapple, your target must be within your reach, and the target
      must be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a
      Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure,
      you deal basic melee damage and the target becomes grappled (see Appendix
      A: Conditions on page 616). In addition to things that end the condition,
      you can release the target at any time (no action
      required).</p><p><em>Escaping a Grapple.</em> While grappled, a creature
      can use its action to attempt to escape. It must succeed on a Strength or
      Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC.</p><p><em>Moving a
      Grappled Creature. </em>When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled
      creature with you. When you do so, your Speed is halved, unless the
      creature's weight is within your carrying capacity and you are not
      encumbered by bulky items.</p><p><em>Freeing a Grappled Creature.</em> You
      can use the Grapple maneuver to try to free another grappled or restrained
      creature. The creature grappling or restraining the target makes a
      Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. If it fails the saving
      throw, the grappled or restrained creature is freed. Additionally, you may
      move the freed creature 5 feet in any direction.</p>
