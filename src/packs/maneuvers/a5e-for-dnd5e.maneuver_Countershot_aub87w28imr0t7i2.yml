  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With awe-inspiring skill you unleash a thrown weapon or arrow, knocking
      a missile out of the air.</p><p>When you see a missile from a ranged
      weapon attack enter into the normal range of a weapon you are wielding,
      you can use your reaction to deflect it. Use a weapon to make a ranged
      attack against an AC equal to the attack roll of the missile. On a hit,
      the missile is deflected and misses its target.</p><p>At the Narrator's
      discretion, certain ranged weapon attacks (like a giant's thrown rock) may
      be too heavy to be deflected by Countershot.</p>
