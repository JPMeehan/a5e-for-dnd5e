      your opponent easier to combat.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">As a bonus action, you can mark a creature
      within 15 feet with a sigil. Alternatively, you may activate this stance
      by expending your reaction after dealing weapon damage, marking the
      creature you damaged. While a target is marked in this way, any attempt to
      use the Help action against that target is a bonus action, rather than an
      action. This stance ends early if you wish to mark another creature or if
      the target is more than 30 feet away from you.</span></p>
