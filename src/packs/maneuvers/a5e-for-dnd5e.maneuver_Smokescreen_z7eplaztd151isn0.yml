    value: >-
      <p>With an explosive pop on impact your attack releases noxious smoke.
      Make a ranged attack as normal. If this attack hits your target, it bursts
      into a cloud of gas with a 15ft cube centered on your target&rsquo;s
      square until the end of your next turn. Each creature that starts their
      turn in or moves through the smoke must make a constitution save against
      your maneuver DC or have disadvantage on perception and investigation
      checks for 1 minute. Affected creatures can attempt additional saves at
      the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
