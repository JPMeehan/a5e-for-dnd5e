      <p><span class="fontstyle0">With a mighty swing, you strike the ground and
      unleash a powerful burst of energy.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">When you use this ability, choose an adjacent
      square. When you strike this square a 50 feet long, 5 feet wide, line of
      difficult terrain appears in the direction of your choosing. You may also
      choose to make the square you&rsquo;ve chosen the center of a 40-foot
      line. Creatures and objects within the line when it is created take basic
      melee damage. Striking a surface that is 1 foot thick or less, such as a
      rooftop or bridge, severely damages it, causing creatures and objects in
      the area of effect to fall.</span></p>
