      <p>For a moment you distort your enemy&rsquo;s perception, causing them to
      overextend themselves.</p><p>When a creature makes a melee attack roll
      against you, you can use your reaction to gain an expertise die to your AC
      against that creature. This increase only applies to the attacking
      creature and ends at the start of your next turn. Once the attack is
      resolved, you may choose to switch spaces with the target. This movement
      does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
