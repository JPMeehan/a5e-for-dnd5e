    value: >-
      <p>With two deft attacks you rend at your opponent, striking at them first
      to diminish their defenses then delivering a ferocious second
      blow.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action
      and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by
      Extra Attack. Until the start of your next turn, when you hit a creature
      with two or more melee weapon attacks, each hit after the first deals 1d8
      extra damage.</p>
