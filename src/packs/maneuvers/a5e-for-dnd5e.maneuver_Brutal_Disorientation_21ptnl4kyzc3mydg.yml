      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirements:</strong> A hand free, a flash bomb,
      ability to attack for bludgeoning damage</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You slam the flash bomb directly into the creature&rsquo;s
      head as you strike from the other side with a bludgeoning attack. Make a
      melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning damage. On a hit, you expend
      the flash bomb, taking 1d4 points of fire damage, and the target takes an
      additional 1d6 points of fire damage and must make a Constitution saving
      throw against your maneuver DC. A creature that fails is blinded, rattled,
      confused, and poisoned until the end of its next turn. A creature that
      succeeds is poisoned, rattled, and has disadvantage on Perception checks
      until the end of its next turn instead.</p>
