      <p>What you wield isn’t what makes you a deadly combatant— you are the
      weapon. Attaining mastery of some weaponry has taught you how to focus and
      bring all that practice to bear even with lethal implements you’ve never
      seen before.</p><p>You gain proficiency with all weapons (including rare
      weapons).</p>
