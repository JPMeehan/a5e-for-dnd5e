      <p>Severing yourself from your own shadow, you place it at your
      opponent&rsquo;s back! Choose a square within 15 feet. Until the start of
      your next turn, your shadow (AC 10, 1 hp) occupies the chosen space and
      has a range of 5 feet. It cannot attack, but it can serve as a flanking
      partner for you and one other creature that you designate when using this
      maneuver.</p>
