      <p>You redirect your enemy's attack back upon itself.</p><p>When you are
      hit with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to redirect the
      force back to the attacker. The attack misses you and the creature makes
      an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the attack is redirected and
      it becomes the target.</p><p>If you have already hit that creature with a
      Mirror's Glint maneuver since the beginning of your last turn, the
      redirected attack is a critical hit.</p>
