      <p>Suffering in silence is the worst&mdash;pain is far easier to bear when
      you can laugh it off.</p><p>As long as you are able to speak, did not cast
      a spell with vocalized components on your last turn, and have an ally who
      can hear and respond to you, once per round you can reduce the damage you
      take from an attack or spell by an amount equal to your proficiency
      bonus.</p><p>In addition, when you use this stance to reduce the damage
      you take, you can choose to fall&nbsp;prone to reduce the amount of damage
      you take by an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus.</p>
