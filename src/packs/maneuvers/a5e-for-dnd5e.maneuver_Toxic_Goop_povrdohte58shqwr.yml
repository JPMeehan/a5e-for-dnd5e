    value: >-
      Expend a dose of basic poison and a tanglefoot bag to make a ranged weapon
      attack against a creature within 20 feet. On a hit, the creature is
      grappled. It may take an action to make a Strength save at the beginning
      of each of its turns, freeing itself on a success. While it is grappled,
      it is also poisoned. The goop dissipates after a minute or can be
      destroyed (AC 13, hit points equal to your maneuver DC)</p>
