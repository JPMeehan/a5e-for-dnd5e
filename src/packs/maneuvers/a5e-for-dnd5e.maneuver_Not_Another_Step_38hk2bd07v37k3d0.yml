    value: >-
      <p>When you activate this maneuver, select an ally you can see within 30
      feet of you. For 1 minute, hostile creatures must succeed on a Charisma
      saving throw the first time each round they try to move within 15 feet of
      your ally. On a failure, they are unable to move closer to your ally until
      the start of your next turn, but on a success, they become immune to this
      ability for 24 hours. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated.</p>
