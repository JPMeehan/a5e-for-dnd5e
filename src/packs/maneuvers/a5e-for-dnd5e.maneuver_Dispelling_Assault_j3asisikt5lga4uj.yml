      <p>You attack with such fury that your enemy's magical defenses wither and
      fail.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action
      and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by
      Extra Attack. Until the start of your next turn, your weapon attacks score
      a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and when you score a critical hit
      against a creature any spell of 3rd-level or lower on the creature
      ends.</p><p>If you already have a feature that increases the range of your
      critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17-20).</p>
