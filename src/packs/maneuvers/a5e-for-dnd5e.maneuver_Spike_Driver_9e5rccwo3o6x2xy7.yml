      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirements:</strong> A piercing melee weapon, a
      hammer, a hand free</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Immediately after hitting a target with a melee weapon that
      deals piercing damage, you may strike the pommel or haft with the hammer,
      driving the weapon further into the target. The target takes an additional
      1d6 points of piercing damage, and you treat the initial attack roll as if
      you had rolled a result 2 better on the d20 (to a maximum of 20)
      potentially turning it into a critical hit.</p>
