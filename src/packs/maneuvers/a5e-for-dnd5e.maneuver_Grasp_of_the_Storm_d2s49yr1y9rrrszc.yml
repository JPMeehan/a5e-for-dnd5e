      <p><span class="fontstyle0">With a sharp gesture, you reach out toward a
      nearby foe, sending a hand made of lightning to violently draw them
      in.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">Make a single melee weapon attack against a
      creature within 15 feet. The range of this attack increases to 15 feet and
      deals lightning damage. The target must then make a Strength saving throw,
      whether you dealt damage or not, or be pulled up to 10 feet closer to
      you.</span></p>
