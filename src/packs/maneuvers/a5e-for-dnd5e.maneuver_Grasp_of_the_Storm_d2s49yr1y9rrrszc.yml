      <p>With a sharp gesture, you reach out toward a nearby foe, sending a hand
      made of lightning to violently draw them in.</p><p>Make a single melee
      weapon attack against a creature within 15 feet. The range of this attack
      increases to 15 feet and deals lightning damage. The target must then make
      a Strength saving throw, whether you dealt damage or not, or be pulled up
      to 10 feet closer to you.</p>
