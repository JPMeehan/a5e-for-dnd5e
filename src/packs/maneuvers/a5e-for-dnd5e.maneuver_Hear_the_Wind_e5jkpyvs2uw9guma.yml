      <p>You can literally hear the sound of incoming missiles and react to them
      easily.</p>

      <p>Until the end of your next turn, you gain blindsight to a range of 20
      feet. When you are hit by a ranged attack, you make a Perception check
      against a DC equal to the attack roll.</p>

      <p>On a success the attack misses you, and on a critical success you
      redirect it back at the attacker.</p>
