      <p>With a snap of your fingers, your ranged weapon glows red with heat.
      Make a ranged attack roll against an unattended object. On a successful
      hit, unattended flammable materials ignite as if they had been directly
      exposed to great heat and flame. If used to attack a creature, this attack
      deals fire damage.</p>
