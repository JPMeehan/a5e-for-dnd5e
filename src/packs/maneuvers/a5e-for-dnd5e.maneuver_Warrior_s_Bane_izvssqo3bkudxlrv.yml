    value: >-
      <p>In response to an attack from a creature within reach, make a melee
      weapon attack against the attacking creature and expend a dose of basic
      poison. On a hit, the creature must make a Constitution save or for the
      next minute, whenever it would make a melee attack, take the Dash action,
      or make a Strength or Dexterity check, it takes 2d6 acid damage. This
      effect can be ended early by administering an antitoxin.</p>
