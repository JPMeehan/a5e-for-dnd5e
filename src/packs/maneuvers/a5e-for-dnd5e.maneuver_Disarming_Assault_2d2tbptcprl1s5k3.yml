    value: >-
      <p>Instead of waiting for an opponent to strike so you can slap their
      weapon away, you lay into them with attacks that knock it from their
      hands.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action
      and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by
      Extra Attack. Until the start of your next turn, your strikes can deprive
      foes of their armaments. In addition to dealing damage, when you hit a
      creature with a melee weapon attack it makes a Strength saving throw. On a
      failure, an item of your choice that the creature is holding (including a
      shield) flies from its grip to land in a randomly determined space 10 feet
      away.</p>
