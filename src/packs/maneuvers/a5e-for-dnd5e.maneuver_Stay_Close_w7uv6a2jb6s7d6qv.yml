      <p>Choose an ally within 5 feet of you when you activate this maneuver.
      Until the end of your turn, your ally can use their reaction to move up to
      their speed. They do not need to spend all of their movement at once, but
      they lose this benefit if they are ever more than 5 feet from you. Their
      movement may be simultaneous with yours.</p>
