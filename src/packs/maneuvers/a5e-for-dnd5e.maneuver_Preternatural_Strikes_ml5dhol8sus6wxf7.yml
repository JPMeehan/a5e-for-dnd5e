      <p>By executing your attacks with perfect precision your weapon can slip
      beneath even supernatural defenses.</p><p>Choose a weapon when you learn
      this combat maneuver. When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack
      action and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted
      by Extra Attack. Until the start of your next turn, your weapon attacks
      using that weapon ignore resistance to nonmagical weapon damage.</p>
