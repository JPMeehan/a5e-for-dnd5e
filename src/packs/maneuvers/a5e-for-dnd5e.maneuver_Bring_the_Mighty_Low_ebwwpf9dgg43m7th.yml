      <p>When a creature of up to one size category larger than your animal
      companion makes a melee attack against it, you command your animal
      companion to respond by harrying the attacker&rsquo;s movements. If the
      creature&rsquo;s attack hits, it deals an additional damage die and must
      make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. On a miss, it must make the
      saving throw at disadvantage.</p>

      <p>If the attacking creature is two size categories larger than your
      animal companion, you may direct your animal companion to get under the
      creature&rsquo;s feet and take that creature&rsquo;s basic melee damage
      (in addition to any potential damage from the attack) in order to force it
      to make the Dexterity saving throw as above.</p>
