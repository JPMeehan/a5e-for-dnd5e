      <p>When a creature of up to one size category larger than your animal
      companion makes a melee attack against it, you command your animal
      companion to respond by harrying the attacker&rsquo;s movements. If the
      creature&rsquo;s attack hits, it deals an additional damage die and must
      make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. On a miss, it must make the
      saving throw at disadvantage.</p><p>If the attacking creature is two size
      categories larger than your animal companion, you may direct your animal
      companion to get under the creature&rsquo;s feet and take that
      creature&rsquo;s basic melee damage (in addition to any potential damage
      from the attack) in order to force it to make the Dexterity saving throw
      as above.</p>
