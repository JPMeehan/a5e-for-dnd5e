      <p>In a blur of smooth motion, you unleash a sequence of
      attacks.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action
      and make two weapon attacks, as well as double the number of additional
      attacks granted by Extra Attack. You can replace any number of these
      attacks with combat maneuvers that do not grant more than one attack. At
      the end of your turn your exertion pool is reduced to 0 and you suffer a
      level of fatigue.</p>
