      <p>No matter how far away a foe is, if you can see them they're still in
      danger.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action
      and make a ranged weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted
      by Extra Attack. Choose one target you can see. Until the start of your
      next turn, the target is considered to be within your weapon's normal
      range and it gains no benefit from cover less than total cover.</p>
