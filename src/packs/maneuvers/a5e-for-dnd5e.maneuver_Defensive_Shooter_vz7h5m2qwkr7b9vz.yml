    value: >-
      <p>Responding to aggressive movement, you attack any who draw too near
      with a binding shot. So long as you maintain this stance you may use your
      reaction to make a ranged weapon opportunity attack against any creature
      that moves into or out of a space within 15ft of you. Creatures struck by
      this attack must make a Constitution saving throw or have their speed
      reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.</p>
