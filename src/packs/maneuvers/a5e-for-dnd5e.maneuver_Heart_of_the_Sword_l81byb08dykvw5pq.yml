      <p>You focus on the bond between you and your weapon.</p><p>Choose a
      weapon when you learn this combat maneuver. For the next minute, attacks
      made with the chosen weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 and
      ignore any damage resistances a target might have. If you already have a
      feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit
      range increases by 1 (maximum 17-20).</p>
