      <p>You use all your senses to focus your attacks on a single
      enemy.</p><p>You gain blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. If a creature
      leaves the range of your blindsight, you can use your reaction to mark it
      as prey and move up to your Speed. The next melee weapon attack you make
      against that creature before the end of your next turn deals an additional
      weapon damage die.</p>
