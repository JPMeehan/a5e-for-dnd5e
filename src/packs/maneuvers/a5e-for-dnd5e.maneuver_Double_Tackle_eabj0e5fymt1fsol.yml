    value: >-
      <p>You and an ally tackle a foe together, your combined strength forcing
      them to the ground.</p><p>Choose an ally you can see. Your ally can use
      their reaction to move up to 20 feet to be adjacent to a creature you
      designate.</p><p>As long as you move at least 20 feet and both you and
      your ally are adjacent to the creature, it makes a Strength saving throw
      or is knocked prone.</p><p>Alternatively, you and your ally may both
      choose to go prone to force the creature to fail its save. You cannot use
      this maneuver against creatures more than one size category larger than
      you or your ally.</p>
