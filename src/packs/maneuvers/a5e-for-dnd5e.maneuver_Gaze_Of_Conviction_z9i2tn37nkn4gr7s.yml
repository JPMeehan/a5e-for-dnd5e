      <p>You lock eyes with an opponent with a fury so potent that it cannot be
      ignored.</p><p>You stare down a creature you can see within 30 feet, and
      if it can see you it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the
      creature is compelled to attack you. On its turn the creature moves
      towards you and makes as many attacks against you as it can.</p><p>The
      effects of this maneuver end when you attack a different creature or the
      creature is unable to attack you.</p>
