      <p>You interrupt a spell to stop it being cast.</p><p>When a creature you
      can see within your reach casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make
      a melee weapon attack against it. On a hit, the creature makes a
      Constitution saving throw (against your maneuver DC or as normal,
      whichever is higher) or the spell is interrupted (expending the spell
      slot) and has no effect.</p>
