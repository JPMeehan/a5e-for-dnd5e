      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Unused spell slot of 1st level or higher
      or at least 2 unspent spell points</p><p>You transform your weapon into
      something more immediately useful.</p><p>You transform your weapon into
      another weapon you are proficient with. This change lasts only until the
      end of your turn. If your weapon has magical properties that could apply
      to its new form, they are still present. Otherwise, they are suppressed. A
      ranged weapon such as a bow or sling does not come with ammunition; you
      must provide it as normal.</p>
