      <p>Making haphazard shots to dissuade enemies, you force opponents onto
      the defensive by unleashing death from above so an ally can move into
      position.</p><p>Choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency
      bonus that you can see within your weapon's normal range. Until the start
      of your next turn, a chosen creature's movement does not provoke
      opportunity attacks from creatures you can see as you pelt the area nearby
      with missiles.</p><p>For each opportunity attack a chosen creature would
      have otherwise provoked, you expend one piece of ammunition or thrown
      weapon.</p>
