    value: >-
      <p>Putting yourself in just the right position as you strike, your
      unbalancing hit sends a retreating opponent into a reeling stumble and
      then the ground.</p><p>When a creature within your reach provokes an
      opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
      attack. On a hit, the creature makes a Strength saving throw or it moves
      10 feet in a straight line and is knocked prone.</p>
