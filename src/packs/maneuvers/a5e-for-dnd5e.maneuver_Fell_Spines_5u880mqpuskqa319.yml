  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Flesh and bone obey your command and form spines along your forearm.
      Flinging your arm out, you launch the bony projectiles into your
      opponents. Choose a number of targets up to your proficiency bonus in a 15
      foot cone. Each must make a Dexterity save or take damage equal to your
      basic melee damage and become rattled until the start of its next turn.
      This damage is considered both necrotic and piercing. On a successful
      save, the target does not take the damage, but is still rattled until the
      start of its next turn.</p>
