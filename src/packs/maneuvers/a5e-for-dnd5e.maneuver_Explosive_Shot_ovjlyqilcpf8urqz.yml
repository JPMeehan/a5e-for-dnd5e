      <p><strong>Requirements:&nbsp;</strong>A bag of ball bearings, a ranged
      weapon ready to fire.</p>

      <p>You hastily pack your shot with ball bearings (expending the bag) and
      fire it. Hit or miss, creatures within 5 feet of your target must make a
      Dexterity save against your maneuver DC or take piercing damage equal to
      half the damage done by your shot. (If the shot misses, roll damage as if
      it had hit to determine the damage from this maneuver.)</p>
