    value: >-
      <p>As your ranged attack leaves your hand it fades to translucency, and
      returns when it strikes the target. When you use this maneuver your attack
      fades through the ethereal plane before returning to your current plane.
      This causes your attack to ignore cover, including full cover, or to
      attack through a solid wall no more than 20ft thick.</p>
