      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirements:</strong> A hand free, an oil flask, a
      flask of alchemist&rsquo;s fire</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You throw the oil and alchemist&rsquo;s fire together at a
      square you can see within 30 feet (expending both). They shatter at the
      same time, splashing blazing liquid everywhere, instantly igniting
      unattended flammable objects in the affected area. Creatures within 5 feet
      of the selected square must make a Dexterity save against your Maneuver DC
      or take 4d6 points of fire damage and suffer 1d6 points of ongoing fire
      damage which persists for a minute or until an affected creature uses its
      action to make a DC 14 Dexterity save to extinguish the flames or is
      doused with at least 1 gallon of water. Creatures that succeed on their
      initial Dexterity save take half damage and do not suffer ongoing
      damage.</p>
