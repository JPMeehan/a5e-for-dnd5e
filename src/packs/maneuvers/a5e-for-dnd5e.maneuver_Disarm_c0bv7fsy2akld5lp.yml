      <p>You can use the Disarm maneuver to attempt to knock an item or weapon
      from a creature's hand. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the
      Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.</p><p>The target must
      be within your reach and be holding an item (either carried or wielded).
      The target makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your
      maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and the target
      drops the item in its space. The target has advantage if it is larger than
      you or holding the item with two or more hands, and a target smaller than
      you has disadvantage.</p>
