    value: >-
      <p>With a bone crushing strike you briefly deprive an opponent of their
      very ability to move.</p>

      <p>Make a melee weapon attack roll using a weapon that has the heavy
      property. A creature damaged by the attack makes a Strength saving throw,
      and on a failure it is paralyzed until it takes damage or the end of your
      next turn (whichever comes first).</p>
