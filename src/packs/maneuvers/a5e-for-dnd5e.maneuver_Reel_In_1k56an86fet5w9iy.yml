      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirement:</strong> Rope with grappling hook, not
      wielding a two-handed weapon or shield.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">You make a ranged weapon attack against a creature of Large
      size or smaller within 15 feet. On a hit, it must make a Strength save
      against your maneuver DC or be pulled to the closest space adjacent to you
      and you can make a weapon attack against it with advantage. A creature
      that succeeds on its save is pulled off-balance instead. It is treated as
      flanked and its walking speed is reduced by 5 until the end of its next
      turn.</p>
