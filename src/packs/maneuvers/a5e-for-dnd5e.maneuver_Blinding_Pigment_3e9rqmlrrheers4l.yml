      hand free</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Make a ranged weapon attack against a target within 15 feet
      of you with the paint pot or oil flask, expending it. On a hit, the target
      takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier, is
      affected as if you had splashed them with the paint pot normally, and must
      make a Constitution save against your maneuver DC or be blinded until the
      end of its next turn.</p>
