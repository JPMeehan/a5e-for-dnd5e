      <p><span class="fontstyle0">Balling your hand into a fist, you speak a
      word </span><span class="fontstyle0">of power and conjure a large,
      translucent </span><span class="fontstyle0">gauntlet that seizes up your
      enemy.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">Choose a creature of no more than one size
      </span><span class="fontstyle0">category larger than you that is within 30
      </span><span class="fontstyle0">feet. The target must then make a Strength
      or Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and
      the target becomes grappled by a gauntleted hand made of force. This
      effect requires concentration as though it were a spell.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">You may use your bonus action each turn to
      maintain the grapple for up to a number of rounds equal to half your
      level. When you maintain a grapple, the target takes basic melee damage on
      your turn. A creature that becomes grappled while in the air remains in
      its current square, even though its flight speed becomes 0, though at the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion it may have to make a saving throw or fall
      once it is no longer grappled.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">At the beginning of each of its turns, a
      creature grappled by this maneuver can make a Strength saving throw,
      ending the effect on itself on a success. This effect also ends early if
      you target another creature with the gauntlet or if you move more than 45
      feet from the target. </span></p>
