    value: >-
      <p>Balling your hand into a fist, you speak a word of power and conjure a
      large, translucent gauntlet that seizes up your enemy.</p><p>Choose a
      creature of no more than one size category larger than you that is within
      30 feet. The target must then make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw.
      On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and the target becomes grappled
      by a gauntleted hand made of force. This effect requires concentration as
      though it were a spell.</p><p>You may use your bonus action each turn to
      maintain the grapple for up to a number of rounds equal to half your
      level. When you maintain a grapple, the target takes basic melee damage on
      your turn. A creature that becomes grappled while in the air remains in
      its current square, even though its flight speed becomes 0, though at the
      Narrator&rsquo;s discretion it may have to make a saving throw or fall
      once it is no longer grappled.</p><p>At the beginning of each of its
      turns, a creature grappled by this maneuver can make a Strength saving
      throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. This effect also ends
      early if you target another creature with the gauntlet or if you move more
      than 45 feet from the target. </p>
