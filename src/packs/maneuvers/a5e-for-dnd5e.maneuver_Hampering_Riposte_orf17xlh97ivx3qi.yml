  description:
    value: ' In response to an attack, you lash out with a blade poisoned with a toxin that makes your enemy sluggish. Make a melee weapon attack with advantage and expend a dose of basic poison. On a hit, the target takes 1 point of slashing damage and must make a Constitution save against your maneuver DC. A creature that fails is slowed for one minute. A creature that succeeds is poisoned and rattled until the end of your next turn instead. A slowed creature may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>'
