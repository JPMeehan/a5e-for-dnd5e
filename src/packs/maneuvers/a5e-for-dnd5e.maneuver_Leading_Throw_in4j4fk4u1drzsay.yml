    value: >-
      <p>An opponent that strikes at you invites peril as they find the momentum
      from their attack turned against them.</p><p>When a creature within your
      reach misses you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to
      try to throw it. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or moves 15
      feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice.</p>
