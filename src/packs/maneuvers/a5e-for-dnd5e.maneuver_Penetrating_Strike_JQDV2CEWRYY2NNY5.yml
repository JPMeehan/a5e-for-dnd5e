      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Unused spell slot of 3rd level or higher
      or at least 5 unspent spell points, spell from the conjuration school
      available to cast.</p>

      <p>You call upon your magical abilities to pass through an enemy&rsquo;s
      defenses as if they were not there.</p>

      <p>You make a single weapon attack against a target, with a +20 bonus to
      hit. This attack requires such intense focus that it cannot be augmented
      via other means such as a herald&rsquo;s Divine Smite, a rogue's Sneak
      Attack, or any other spell or effect that would add additional effects to
      the attack. The attack cannot land a critical hit.</p>
