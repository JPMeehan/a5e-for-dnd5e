    value: >-
      <p>After working your way into an opponent's guard you convince them that
      every step will lead to a disastrous end, and that to divert their
      attention away from you for even a moment invites devastation.</p><p>A
      creature within your reach makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a
      failure, it reacts to a strike from you that never comes. As long as you
      remain within the target's reach, until the start of your next turn it
      cannot attack any creature other than you.</p><p>After you have used this
      maneuver against a creature, until the end of combat it has advantage on
      saving throws against Force Hesitation.</p>
