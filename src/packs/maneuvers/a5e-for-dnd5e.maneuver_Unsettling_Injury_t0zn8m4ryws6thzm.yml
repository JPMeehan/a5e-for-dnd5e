      <p>Your attack unnerves your foe, making it hard for them to
      concentrate.</p><p>Choose a weapon when you learn this combat maneuver.
      Make a melee weapon attack using the chosen weapon, and on a hit the
      target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target loses
      concentration on any spell it has cast, any combat stance it is using
      ends, and it cannot use combat maneuvers or cast spells until the end of
      your next turn.</p>
