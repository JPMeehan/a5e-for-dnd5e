    value: >-
      <p>Choose a creature of the up to one size category larger than your
      animal companion within 20 feet. When your animal companion next makes a
      melee attack against that creature, it can also use its bonus action to
      make a Grapple maneuver against that creature. On a success, your animal
      companion may move 10 feet toward you, dragging the creature along with
      it.</p>
