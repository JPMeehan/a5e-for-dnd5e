      <p>You swiftly adjust your enemy's armor so that they cannot
      move.</p><p>Make a Sleight of Hand check against the AC of a creature
      within reach that is wearing armor, paralyzing it on a success. At the
      beginning of each of its turns, a creature paralyzed by this maneuver can
      make a Strength saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success
      (unlike normal, the paralyzed creature doesn't automatically fail this
      save).</p><p>A creature wearing heavy armor has disadvantage on its saving
      throw.</p>
