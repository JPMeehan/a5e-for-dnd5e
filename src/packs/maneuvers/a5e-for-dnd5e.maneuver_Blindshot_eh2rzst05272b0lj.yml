      <p>By closing your eyes and focusing on the sound of the environment, you
      target an unseen foe with uncanny accuracy.</p><p>Make a Perception check
      against the passive Stealth of a target you cannot see that is within 30
      feet. On a success, you know the target's location and do not have
      disadvantage on your next ranged attack against it before the end of your
      turn.</p>
