      <p>From atop your mount, you strike down at your foes with powerful
      blows.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action
      and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by
      Extra Attack. You must be mounted to use this maneuver.</p><p>Until the
      end of your next turn, when you use a melee weapon attack to hit a
      creature of a size smaller than your mount, it makes a Strength saving
      throw. On a failure, it suffers one of the following (your choice):
      confused until the start of your next turn, knocked prone, or slowed until
      the end of your next turn.</p>
