    value: >-
      <p>With a whisper of death singing behind it, your arrow spells doom for
      your foes. As a special attack action you make a single ranged weapon
      attack against a foe within range. The target of this ranged weapon attack
      must make a Charisma save or be struck by a critical hit. If you roll a
      natural 20 on the attack roll, this attack triples the normal damage of
      your attack if the target also fails their saving throw.</p>
