      <p>Mastery is making sure even a mistake becomes an opportunity. You
      follow-through on a miss to attack a different enemy.</p><p>When you miss
      with a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can use your reaction
      to take your momentum and target a different creature within your reach
      with a melee attack using the same weapon.</p><p>This attack is made with
      advantage and deals extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus. If both
      attack rolls would hit the creature, it is stunned until the end of its
      next turn.</p>
