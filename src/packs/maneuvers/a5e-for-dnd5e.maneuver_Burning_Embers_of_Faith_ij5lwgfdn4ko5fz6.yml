      towards your foes.</p><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use
      your reaction to heal a number of hit points equal to your proficiency
      bonus.</p><p>If you were reduced to 0 hit points by a spell, you instead
      heal a number of hit points equal to your level. In addition, for the next
