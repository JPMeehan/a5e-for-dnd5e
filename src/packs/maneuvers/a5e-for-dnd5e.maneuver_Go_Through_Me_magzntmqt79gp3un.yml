      <p dir="ltr">When you activate this maneuver, choose an ally within 10
      feet of you. For 1 minute, that ally cannot be targeted by attacks or
      harmful spells unless you are incapacitated, although they are not
      protected from area effects. This effect ends early if you use this
      maneuver on another creature or move more than 60 feet away from your
      chosen ally.</p>
