  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a baleful word and a vicious strike you draw the very lifeforce
      from your target. Make a&nbsp;melee weapon attack roll</span>. A creature
      damaged by this attack makes a Constitution&nbsp;saving throw, and on a
      failure you gain hit points equal to one of its hit dice + your
      Constitution modifier (two on a critical hit) as if you had taken a
      <span>short rest. This does not deal additional damage, but does expend
      the hit die if the creature is capable of spending them.</p>
