      <p>With a hissing malediction, you place your curse upon a specific foe.
      Before the start of your next turn, when you hit a creature with a melee
      weapon attack you can choose to lay a curse on it. It must make a Wisdom
      saving throw or be unable to gain advantage on attack rolls against you
      for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. This curse can
      only be applied to one creature at a time.</p>
