      <p>You can use the Shove maneuver to push a creature away. If you are able
      to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces
      one of them.</p><p>The target must be within your reach and be no more
      than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength saving
      throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage
      and push the target a number of feet away from you equal to 5 + 5 for
      every 5 points it failed its saving throw by. You can move the creature in
      any direction away from you (to the side, forward, or diagonally
      away).</p><p>A creature that is shoved off of a precipice is propelled off
      of whatever it is standing on -- it does not receive any saving throw or
      ability check to grab onto something to avoid falling down below.</p>
