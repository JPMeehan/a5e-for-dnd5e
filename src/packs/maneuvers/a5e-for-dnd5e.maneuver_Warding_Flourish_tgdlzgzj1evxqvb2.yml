      <p><span class="fontstyle0">With a mystical flourish of your weapon you
      create a shield of force around a nearby ally.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">Choose an ally within 15 feet that you can
      see. As long as that ally stays within 15 feet of you, they increase their
      AC by 2. You can only ward one creature at a time, and cannot use this
      ward on yourself. This effect ends if you can no longer take
      actions.</span></p>
