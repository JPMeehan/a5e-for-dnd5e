      <p>If you have Extra Attack, you may use this maneuver in place of one
      attack.</p>

      <p>You command your animal companion to leap at a flying creature and
      target its means of flight. Your animal companion may move up to 20 feet
      to get into position and gains a vertical jump height equal to half its
      Speed for the purposes of striking the target creature. The creature is
      forced to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, its flight speed is
      reduced by half until healed and it immediately plummets to the ground (or
      60 feet, whichever comes first) and takes falling damage as usual. On a
      success, it takes damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Creatures more
      than 1 size category larger than your animal companion make this save with
      advantage.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the result, after performing the maneuver, your animal
      companion lands in an unoccupied square of your choice that is adjacent to
      the one directly below the target, taking fall damage as normal. If there
      are no unoccupied adjacent squares, your animal companion falls either
      into the square directly below the target creature (which may, in turn,
      fall on your companion) or onto the creature in the adjacent occupied
      square of your choice. Both the creature that falls into an occupied
      square and its occupant take double the normal amount of fall damage
      before the falling creature is shunted into the closest unoccupied
      space.</p>
