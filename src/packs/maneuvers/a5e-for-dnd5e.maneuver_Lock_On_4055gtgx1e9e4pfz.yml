      <p><strong>Requirements: </strong>A set of manacles, not wielding a shield
      or two-handed weapon.</p>

      <p>When a creature up to one size category larger or smaller than you
      misses you with an attack, you may use your reaction to lock yourself to
      the creature with the manacles. As long as you and the creature are locked
      to each other this way, you are considered to be grappling each other. The
      target must break or escape the manacles as normal to escape the grapple,
      but you can end it as a bonus action.</p>
