    value: >-
      <p>When you activate this maneuver, choose a number of non-hostile
      creatures other than yourself within 30 feet of you that you can see equal
      to your proficiency bonus. Each of those creatures may choose to
      immediately use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking
      opportunity attacks. If they do so, they must use their entire movement
      attempting to move to safety. What is considered &ldquo;safety&rdquo; is
      subject to Narrator discretion, but typically, this means moving as far
      from obvious sources of danger as possible.</p>
