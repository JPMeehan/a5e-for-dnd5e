      <p>A rain of short, sharp strikes disorients your enemy.</p><p>When you
      activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action and make a weapon
      attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack. As long
      as all of your attacks on your turn are melee weapon attacks that target
      the same creature, that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against
      you until the start of your next turn.</p>
