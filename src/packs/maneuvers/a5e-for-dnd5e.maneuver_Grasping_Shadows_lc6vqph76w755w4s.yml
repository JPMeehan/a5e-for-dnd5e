      <p>At your behest, the shadows themselves grip at your foes, pulling and
      dragging like quicksand. Choose 4 squares within 20 feet of you that are
      in dim light or darkness . These squares become areas of magical darkness
      which are treated as difficult terrain and can&rsquo;t be illuminated
      except by magic, such as the light spell. This effect lasts until the end
      of your next turn.</p>
