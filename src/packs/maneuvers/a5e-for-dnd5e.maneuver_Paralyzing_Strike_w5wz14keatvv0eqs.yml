      Expend a dose of curare as part of a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the
      target takes an additional 2d6 poison damage and must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed for one minute. On
      a successful save it is slowed instead. In either case, the target may
      repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
      success.</p>
