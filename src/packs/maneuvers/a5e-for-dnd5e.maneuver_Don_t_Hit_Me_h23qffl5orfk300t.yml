      <p>Even a well-told lie of being harmless only works if you&rsquo;re
      really believing it when you tell it&mdash;and in the midst of a pitched
      fight it&rsquo;s easy to muster some real feeling to briefly fool a
      foe.</p>

      <p>When a creature makes an attack against you, you can use your reaction
      to make a Deception or nonmusical Performance check with <span
      class="freelinking-link">disadvantage</span> , opposed by its Insight
      check. On a success, the creature is briefly perplexed and targets a
      different creature with the attack instead.</p>
