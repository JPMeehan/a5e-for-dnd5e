      <p>Carefully judging the wind and everything else that might interfere,
      you unleash an impressive shot that delights all who see it.</p>

      <p>Make a ranged weapon attack against an unattended object. On a hit, you
      can use the result of the attack roll instead of making a Performance
      check, and you gain an expertise die when doing so. Otherwise the kinds of
      trick shots you can make are at the Narrator's discretion.</p>
