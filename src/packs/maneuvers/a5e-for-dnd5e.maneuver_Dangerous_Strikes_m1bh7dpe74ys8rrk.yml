      <p>The execution and follow-through of your strike is exquisite with not
      an iota of force wasted.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take
      the Attack action and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional
      attacks granted by Extra Attack. Until the start of your next turn, your
      weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.</p><p>If you
      already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits,
      your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17-20).</p>
