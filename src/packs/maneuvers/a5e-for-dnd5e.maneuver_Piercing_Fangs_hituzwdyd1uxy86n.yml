      <p>Make a melee attack against a creature that is grappling you and expend
      a dose of basic poison. On a hit, the target takes normal weapon damage
      plus 2d4 poison damage and also takes 1d4 ongoing poison damage for the
      next minute or until an antitoxin is administered to it. The creature must
      also make a Constitution save or immediately release the grapple.</p>
