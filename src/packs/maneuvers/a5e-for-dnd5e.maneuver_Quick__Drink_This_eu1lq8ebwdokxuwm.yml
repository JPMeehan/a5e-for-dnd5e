      <p>No matter how deadly or serious an opponent is, if they can drink, you
      can splash something down their throat with superlative timing.</p><p>Make
      a Persuasion check opposed by the Insight check of a creature within your
      reach. On a success, the creature drinks whatever item you are offering to
      it, whether that is a potion, poison, or otherwise. Any alchemical item
      (such as an
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.b0z0yz39b3qy3hdo]{Acid Flask} or
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.gear.Item.4t0m2ttaca5hg2vi]{Alchemist's
      Fire}) deals four times as much damage as normal when a creature drinks it
      in this way, although any ongoing damage is only dealt twice.</p>
