      <p>The art of battle is driven as much by the minds of combatants as it is
      their muscles, and you have made it your business to get into a
      foe&rsquo;s head, even if only for a brief moment</p>

      <p>When a creature makes an attack against you, you can use your reaction
      to make a Deception check with <span
      class="freelinking-link">advantage</span> opposed by its Insight check. On
      a success, the creature is briefly perplexed and not sure you&rsquo;re an
      enemy, targeting a different creature with the attack instead.</p>

      <p>In addition, until the end of your next turn the creature treats you as
      an ally (instead of an enemy) for the purposes of traits and other
      effects, and it cannot target you with attacks. The effects of this combat
      maneuver end early if you damage it.</p>
