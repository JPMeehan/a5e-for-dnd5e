    value: >-
      <p>After striking a telling blow, your following attacks strike true.
      After landing a critical hit on a target you may expend your reaction to
      lock onto your target. Until the end of your next turn, you are incapable
      of missing the target locked opponent with ranged weapon attacks, with
      even natural 1s hitting. If you attack another creature and miss, your
      attack hits your target locked opponent, instead.</p>
