      <p>Sometimes putting on a friendly face and sidling up to an enemy
      thirsting for your blood is just unexpected enough to work.</p>

      <p>Make a Deception check opposed by the Insight check of a creature able
      to see you. On a success, until the end of your next turn the creature
      treats you as an ally (instead of an enemy) for the purposes of traits and
      other effects. The creature can still target you with attacks, and the
      effects of this combat maneuver end early if you damage it.</p>
