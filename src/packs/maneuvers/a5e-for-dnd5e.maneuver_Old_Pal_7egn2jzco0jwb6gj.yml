      <p>Sometimes putting on a friendly face and sidling up to an enemy
      thirsting for your blood is just unexpected enough to work.</p><p>Make a
      Deception check opposed by the Insight check of a creature able to see
      you. On a success, until the end of your next turn the creature treats you
      as an ally (instead of an enemy) for the purposes of traits and other
      effects. The creature can still target you with attacks, and the effects
      of this combat maneuver end early if you damage it.</p>
