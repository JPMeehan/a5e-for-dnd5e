      <p>You throw your ally at an opponent, lending them extra
      power.</p><p>Choose a willing ally within your reach that is at least one
      size category smaller than you. You hurl your ally at a creature within 20
      feet. Your ally lands in a space adjacent to the creature and can use
      their reaction to make a melee weapon attack against it. On a hit, the
      creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or the attack becomes a critical
      hit (or if the attack is already a critical hit your ally deals maximum
      damage).</p>
