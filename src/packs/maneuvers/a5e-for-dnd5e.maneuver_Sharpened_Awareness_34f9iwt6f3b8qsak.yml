      <p>You tune your senses, focusing on the fight at hand.</p><p>You can use
      your reaction to make a Perception check when a creature makes an attack
      against you, turning it into a miss if your result is higher than the
      attack roll. In addition, if the attack is turned into a miss you gain
      advantage on attacks made against that creature until the end of your next
      turn.</p><p>If the attack still hits you, the creature has disadvantage on
      its next attack made against you before the end of its next turn.</p>
