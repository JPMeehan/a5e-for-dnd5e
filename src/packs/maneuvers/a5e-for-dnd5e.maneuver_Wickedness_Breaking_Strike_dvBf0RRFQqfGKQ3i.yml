      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirement:</strong> <em>you must be concentrating
      on a spell of the radiant school to use this maneuver</em></p>

      <p dir="ltr">You make a single weapon attack against the target. If it
      hits, you deal damage as if you had hit with as many weapon attacks as you
      can make with Extra Attack, plus one (for example, if you can attack twice
      with Extra Attack, roll the damage of three attacks) and you lose
      concentration on the spell after the attack deals damage (allowing you to
      benefit from any attack benefits provided by the spell before
      concentration is lost). If this attack is a critical hit, it deals no
      additional damage, but you do not lose concentration on the spell.</p>
