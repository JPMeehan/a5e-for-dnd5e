      <p>You draw your hand along your blade, limning it in hellish flame. As a
      bonus action, you coat your weapon in green flame, causing your next
      successful melee weapon attack before the end of your next turn to
      potentially strike two targets within reach. The first target takes damage
      normally. The second target must make a Dexterity saving throw or take
      necrotic damage equal to half the damage dealt to the first target.</p>
