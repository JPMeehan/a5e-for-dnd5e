    value: >-
      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Unused spell slot of 3rd level or higher
      or at least 5 unspent spell points, spell from the abjuration school
      available to cast.</p><p>You summon your will to purge harmful effects
      from yourself.</p><p>You end a single condition affecting you from the
      following list: blinded, charmed, confused, deafened, frightened,
      grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, rattled,
      restrained, slowed, stunned, or unconscious (provided you have at least 1
      hit point). Even if the condition would normally prevent you from taking
      actions (such as being stunned, paralyzed, or unconscious), you may use
      this maneuver, but the exception from this maneuver does not extend to any
      other capabilities you possess. Alternatively, you may choose to end the
      effect of a spell affecting you if it was cast with a spell slot of 3rd
      level or lower.</p>
