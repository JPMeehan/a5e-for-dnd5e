      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Unused spell slot of 3rd level or higher
      or at least 5 unspent spell points, spell from the abjuration school
      available to cast.</p>

      <p>You summon your will to purge harmful effects from yourself.</p>

      <p>You end a single condition affecting you from the following list:
      blinded, charmed, confused, deafened, frightened, grappled, incapacitated,
      paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, rattled, restrained, slowed, stunned, or
      unconscious (provided you have at least 1 hit point). Even if the
      condition would normally prevent you from taking actions (such as being
      stunned, paralyzed, or unconscious), you may use this maneuver, but the
      exception from this maneuver does not extend to any other capabilities you
      possess. Alternatively, you may choose to end the effect of a spell
      affecting you if it was cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or lower.</p>
