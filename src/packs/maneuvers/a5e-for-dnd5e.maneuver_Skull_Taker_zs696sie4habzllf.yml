      <p>Channeling your dark power into a single brutal attack, you attempt to
      decapitate your target. Make a melee weapon attack. On a hit, your attack
      becomes a critical hit, and if your attack would have already been a
      critical hit the creature makes a Constitution&nbsp;saving throw. On a
      failure, it takes an additional 10d10 damage. On a success, it takes half
      damage.</p><div><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:</div><div><p>Extra Attack
