      <p dir="ltr">When you activate this maneuver, you take the attack action
      as well as any attacks granted by Extra attack. At least one attack must
      be used to attempt to free another creature from the grappled or
      restrained condition. Creatures grappling or restraining your allies have
      disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain those conditions, and you
      have advantage on attacks against objects that are grappling or
      restraining your allies such as chains or manacles.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">In addition, until the end of your turn, your speed is not
      reduced on account of dragging or carrying the creature.</p>
