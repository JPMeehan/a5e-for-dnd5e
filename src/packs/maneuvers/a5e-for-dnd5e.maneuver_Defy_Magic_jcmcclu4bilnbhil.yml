    value: >-
      <p>The potency of magic is dependent upon whoever wields it, and whether
      arcane or divine most spells and spellcasters pale in comparison to your
      obsessive conviction.</p><p>When you see a creature within 30 feet make a
      spell attack against you, you can use your reaction to defy it. The
      creature makes a spellcasting ability check against your maneuver DC or
      automatically misses with its spell attack.</p><p>If the spell is of
      7th-level or higher, this combat maneuver has no effect.</p>
