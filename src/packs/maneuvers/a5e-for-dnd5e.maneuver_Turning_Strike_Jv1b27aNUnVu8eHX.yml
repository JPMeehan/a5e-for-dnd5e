      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Requirements:</strong> <em>ability to turn at least
      one creature type, a use of Channel Divinity available</em></p>

      <p dir="ltr">Make a melee weapon attack against a creature. On a hit, it
      takes normal weapon damage and is also affected as if you had used
      @UUID[Compendium.a5e-for-dnd5e.class-features.Item.zhuf06durl8bnmh3]{Turn
      Undead} on it (forcing a save and the usual results from that save as
      normal, but using the higher of your maneuver or spell save DC). This does
      not expend your use of Channel Divinity, but it also does not affect any
      other creatures.</p>
