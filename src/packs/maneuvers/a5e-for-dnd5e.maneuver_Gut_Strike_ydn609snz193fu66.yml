      <p>You instinctively know when you hit an opponent's weak spot and can
      muster an extra bit of force to devastating effect, causing your foe to
      suffer momentary fatigue.</p><p>When you hit a creature with a weapon
      attack, you can use your reaction to give the target one level of fatigue
      for 1 minute. On a critical hit, the target gains two levels of fatigue
      instead. A target cannot gain more than two levels of fatigue from this
      maneuver.</p>
