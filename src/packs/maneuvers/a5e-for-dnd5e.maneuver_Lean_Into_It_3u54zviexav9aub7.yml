      <p>Not just commiting to an assault, you shoulder into it with all the
      strength you can bear and deliver hits that resonate in the very bones of
      your foes.</p>

      <p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action and make a
      weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack.
      Until the start of your next turn, when you hit a creature with a melee
      weapon attack it makes a Strength saving throw or it is knocked prone.</p>
