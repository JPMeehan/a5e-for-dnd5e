      <p><span class="fontstyle0">Drawing a fingertip across your weapon, you
      briefly inscribe a glowing mark before you strike your opponent, which
      reminds them of your threat when they seek to engage others.</span></p>

      <p><span class="fontstyle0">As part of this stance, you trace a rune onto
      a melee weapon. Your mark is transferred to the next creature you
      successfully hit with the inscribed weapon. If the marked creature
      attempts to attack any other target but you, it takes force damage equal
      to your Intelligence modifier, regardless of whether the attack hits. This
      stance ends early if you wish to mark another creature or if the target is
      more than 30 feet away from you.</span></p>
