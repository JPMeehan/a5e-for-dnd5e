      <p>Like a stalking predator you run down your prey and pounce with a
      lethal attack that throws your opponent to the ground or knocks them
      back.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the Attack action
      and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks granted by
      Extra Attack. Move up to 40 feet in a straight line. If you hit with a
      melee weapon attack at the end of your movement, the target makes a
      Strength saving throw, and on a failure it is either knocked prone or
      pushed back 10 feet (your choice).</p>
