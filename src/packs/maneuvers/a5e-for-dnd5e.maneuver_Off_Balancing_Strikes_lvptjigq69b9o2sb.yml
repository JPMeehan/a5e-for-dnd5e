    value: >-
      <p>Focusing your attacks on an opponent's weak points allows you to not
      just wound, but to confound.</p>

      <p>Until the start of your next turn, when you hit a creature with a melee
      weapon attack instead of dealing damage you can choose to use pulls,
      shoves, and strikes to put your target off-balance.</p>

      <p>Until the end of your next turn, the target moves at half Speed, and it
      has disadvantage on ability checks and Dexterity saving throws.</p>
