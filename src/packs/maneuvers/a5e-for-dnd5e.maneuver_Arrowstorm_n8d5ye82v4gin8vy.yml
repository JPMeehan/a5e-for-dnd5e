      <p>Firing a single arrow results in a tempest of danger as it splits into
      dozens in flight. When you use this maneuver your next ranged weapon
      attack becomes a cone effect. Forgoing multiple attacks, you instead make
      an attack roll against each creature in a 30ft cone. This cone begins at a
      square of your choosing within 15ft.</p>
