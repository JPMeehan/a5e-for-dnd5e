      <p>When an ally you can see that is no more than one size larger than you
      falls, you may use your reaction to move up to your speed provided you end
      your movement within 5 feet of the path of your ally&rsquo;s fall. Make a
      Strength saving throw against the DC of whatever effect caused your ally
      to fall. (Alternatively, make a DC 10 Strength saving throw if there is no
      clear DC). On a success, you grapple your ally and negate any falling
      damage.</p>
