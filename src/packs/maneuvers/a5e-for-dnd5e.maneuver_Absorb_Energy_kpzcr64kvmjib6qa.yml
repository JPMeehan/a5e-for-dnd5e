      <p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Unused spell slot of 4th level or higher
      or at least 6 unspent spell points, spell from the abjuration school
      available to cast.</p><p>You can absorb some of the magical energy of
      spells cast on you for your own purposes.</p><p>Use this maneuver when you
      become the sole target of a spell. You recover a spell slot or number of
      spell points equal to half the minimum which is necessary to cast the
      spell, rounded down. For example, if you were hit with an acid arrow you
      could use this maneuver to recover a 1st- level spell slot or 1 spell
      point. If a cure wounds spell was cast on you with a 5th-level spell slot,
      you could recover 1 spell point (but not a spell slot). If you already
      have your full allotment of spell slots for the given level or if your
      spell points are at their maximum, any excess is lost. The triggering
      spell otherwise affects you as normal. You may not absorb energy from
      spells you cast on yourself.</p>
