      <p>You strike a spellcaster and disrupt their control over magic,
      fracturing the power behind a spell and transforming the energy so it
      roots them to the spot.</p><p>When a creature you can see within your
      reach casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
      attack against it. On a hit, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or
      the spell is interrupted (expending the spell slot) and it rolls 1d4 to
      determine how the fraying magic affects it: 1-- the creature's Speed is
      reduced to 0, 2 -- the creature becomes confused until the end of its next
      turn, 3 -- the creature has disadvantage on checks made to concentrate on
      spells until it succeeds on a concentration check, 4 -- the creature is
      stunned until the end of its next turn and rattled for the next
      minute.</p>
