      <p>A powerful blow smashes a weapon from your enemy's grasp.</p>

      <p>When you hit a creature using a melee weapon that has the heavy
      property, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Strength saving
      throw. On a failure, a weapon it is wielding (your choice) flies from its
      grip to land in a randomly determined space 10 feet away.</p>

      <p>A creature that is two or more size categories larger than you has
      advantage on its saving throw.</p>
