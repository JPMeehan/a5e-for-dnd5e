    value: >-
      <p>With a vicious strike, you blind your enemy.</p><p>When you activate
      this maneuver, you take the Attack action and make a weapon attack, as
      well as any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack. Until the start of
      your next turn, when you use a melee weapon to deal damage against a
      creature, it is blinded and can't benefit from either blindsight or
      tremorsense.</p><p>At the beginning of each of its turns, a creature
      blinded by this maneuver can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the
      effect on itself on a success.</p>
