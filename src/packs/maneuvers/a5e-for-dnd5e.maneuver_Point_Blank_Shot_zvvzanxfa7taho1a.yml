    value: >-
      <p>With uncanny swiftness you ready a weapon normally only used at range,
      compensating for making an attack at an opponent within only a few feet
      and giving your enemies reason to be wary.</p><p>Until the end of your
      next turn, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and
      who isn't incapacitated does not give you disadvantage when making a
      ranged attack using a weapon.</p><p>In addition, when an adjacent hostile
      creature that you can see moves 5 feet or more away from you, you can use
      your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it.</p>
