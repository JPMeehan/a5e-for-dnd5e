      <p>The battle around you narrows as you focus your ire on a single
      opponent, ignoring other threats or enemies.</p><p>Choose one creature you
      can see within 30 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you cannot
      attack any other targets and you have advantage on weapon attacks made
      against that creature.</p><p>On a critical hit, you can spend exertion to
      use a Tempered Iron maneuver that you know against the creature so long as
      it can be activated with an action or bonus action.</p>
