      <p>You have mastered a strike that is unmistakably your own.</p><p>Choose
      a simple symbol (such as a letter) to be your signature. When you have
      advantage on a melee weapon attack roll, on a hit you can leave your
      signature on the creature or object you attacked. Your signature remains
      on a creature until it is fully healed and has taken a long
      rest.</p><p>While a creature bears your signature, you can use a bonus
      action to try to intimidate it. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw
      against your maneuver DC or becomes frightened of you until the start of
      your next turn.</p>
