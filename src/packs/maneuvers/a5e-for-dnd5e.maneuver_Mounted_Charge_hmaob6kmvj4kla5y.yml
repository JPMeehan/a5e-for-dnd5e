      <p>You charge your foe using your mount's strength and swiftness to add
      power to your attack.</p><p>When you activate this maneuver, you take the
      Attack action and make a weapon attack, as well as any additional attacks
      granted by Extra Attack. You must be mounted to use this
      maneuver.</p><p>Move up to your mount's Speed in a straight line. If at
      the end of your movement there is a creature within your reach, the first
      attack you make against it as part of this maneuver has
      advantage.</p><p>You can't take the Dash action and use this maneuver on
      the same turn.</p>
