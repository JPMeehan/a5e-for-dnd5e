      <p>Pointing your weapon at your foe you challenge them, forcing them to
      lower their defenses so you can launch an attack of your own.</p><p>At the
      end of your turn, you can use your reaction to gain an expertise die to
      your AC against one creature you can see within reach. This increase to
      your AC only applies to the chosen creature and ends at the start of your
      next turn.</p><p>If the creature misses with one or more attacks against
      you before the start of your next turn, you can make a melee weapon attack
      against it.</p>
